Everything's fine.
Baby, come here.
Scared of what?
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
Do you think I'm ugly?
No!
You're beautiful!
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.
I don't know.
I-I'm a mess, Patrick.
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's--
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash-- the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice-- Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
.
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi, it'sJoel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up!
Pick up, man!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want--"
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh--
I got you this...
What?
thing, um--
Happy early valentine's Day.
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
It-
- It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory..
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
.
Can you hear me?
I don't want this any more!
I wanna call it off!
.
When you ain't got nothing to do
I think I'll marry you
Is anybody there?
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement-- Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then-- What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why-
- No, I don't want to-- Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her--
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh,Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
Don't!
That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the--
It's a birthmark!
I t did work, for a second, but I couldn't-- I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually--
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You-
- You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Row, row, row your boat Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat
It's working!
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
Come on,Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
All gooey and-- and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my-- I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's-
- There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't-- I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh--
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
I'm at 159 South village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1E.
Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary-
- Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes-- I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just-
- Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy-- he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You-
- You're kind, beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um--
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already-
- I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
Oh, my darling Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You were lost and gone forever I love being bathed in the sink.
Dreadful sorry, Clementine Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh, this is-- this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to--
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel-
- What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember--
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come on,you big baby!
I'm sorry, okay?
Let me drive you home.
No!
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia-- Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to--
Joel, honey, I have a surprise-- I just-
- Oh, um--
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
Good night, sweetheart.
No.
I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere-- somewhere really buried.
Hit it!
Hit it!
I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Come on, you big sissy!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it,Joel!
He's not listening!
Come on,Joel.
Stupid!
I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live-- lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
Oh, my mom.
It's-
- It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo--Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work, Howard.
I guess, uh--
I guess I'll go out for-- for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh-- that's fine.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I-- I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's-
- It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes--
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander* and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned. *
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I-I-I-I-I-- I'm happy to hear--
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's-
- You're a wonderful girl.
But I-
- You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
Uh--
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You--
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh--
You could-
- Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just--
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you-- Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is--
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I rememberbeing drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back. *
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God."
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either.'
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi,Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like-- Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What dowe do?
Enjoy it.
You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really-- I mean--
We're-- Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin.'
Which one do you want to be?
Uh--
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do--
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had--
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like-- It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye,Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just--
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just--
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me whatyou want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Vamonos, senor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...
last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased.'
I have since decided that this is a horrible-- Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
-Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and--
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart-- Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes-- I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
because she would pronounce...
library "libary." Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I t's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's-- it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind ofa revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Change your heart
Look around you
Change your heart
It will astound you
Now, I need your lovin'
Like the sunshine
And everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

[Man On P.A.] Montauk train on track "B."
[Man] Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
[Man On P.A. Continues] Last call... to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
[Man On P.A.] Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
[Panting]
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
[Joel Continues] It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
[Woman Speaking, Faint]
[Chuckles Softly]
[Joel Continues] Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
[Train Horn Blows]
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
[Inhaling]
[Sniffs]
[Sighs]
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
[Chuckles]
# Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine #
# You were lost and gone forever #
# Dreadful sorry Clementine ##
[Laughing] No?
I'm sorry.
Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
[Clementine] Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
[Exhales]
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
[Giggles]
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...
No, no.
I just...
Sure.
No.
That's okay.
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
## [Radio:
Pop]
Hi.
I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
Um...
[Chuckles] Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
[Laughs] Come on.
[Exhales]
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
[Whispers] I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
[Both Laughing]
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
[Slurps Drink]
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could...
Sounds good.
But I...
I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really...
I'm...
I...
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
[Beeping]
[Line Ringing]
[Clementine] What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
[Laughs]
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
[Laughs] I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
[Sighs] Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
[Clementine] Isn't it?
[Sighs]
[Giggling] Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh!
Oh, my ass!
[Grunts]
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
[Whispers] Come on.
[Mutters]
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!
[Chuckles]
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
[Sighs] Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
[Laughing] It's not gonna crack or break or...
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um...
Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
[Laughs]
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
[Laughing] Shut the fuck up!
[Whispers] Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
[Sighs] Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
[Sighs]
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just...
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
[Sniffles]
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.

Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.

How pathetic is that?
[Man's Voice Echoing, Indistinct]
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
[Whispers] No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
[Chuckling] [Woman] Oh, no!
[Joel] Yes!
Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
[Joel] So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
[Chuckles]
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
[Patrick] Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
- [Patrick] Hi.
- [Kiss]
How are you?
[Clementine] Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
[Patrick] Uh-huh.
[Clementine] I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
[Panting]
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too...
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
[Joel Groans]
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
[Woman] Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
[Dog Barks]
Okay.
What is it?
[Rob] I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
[Woman] Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- [Mutters] Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
[Phone Rings]
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo!
Oh, my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!
[Mutters] Sorry.
Sorry.
[Whispers] Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
I assure you, no.
[Woman] No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
[Dr. Mierzwiak] We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
[Banging]
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
[Rob] Oww!
Fuck!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
[Sighs]
A lark.
[Sobbing] Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
[Woman] Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you.
[Tires Screech] [Driver] Wake up, buddy!
[Mary] No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
[Chuckles]
[Knocks]
## [Dixieland Jazz]
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
## [Continues]
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
[Pencils Clattering On Floor] I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
[Mierzwiak] Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
[Clementine Whooping, Laughing]
There's a good story behind this one...
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
[Stan] Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
- [Clementine's Voice] That's so...
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
[Chuckles]
- Next item.
Okay.
- [Electronic Crackling]
[Stan, Voice Electronically Processed] Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
[Stan] Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
[Patrick] Yeah.
[Stan] Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm... [Scoffs]
[Mierzwiak's Voice, Distant] Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...
[Simultaneously] underway tonight, we have some work to do.
[Whispering] I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
[Simultaneously] We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
[Stan] Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
[Stan's Voice, Echoing] Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- [Stan] A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- [Stan] Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
[Patrick] How's that?
[Mary] How are you today, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
[Stan's Voice] That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
[Stan's Voice, Electronically Accelerated] "I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."
- [Screaming]
- Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
[Beeps] That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
[Sighs]
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
[Whispers] Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Door Unlocking, Opening]
[Joel Whispering] This is the last time I saw you.
[Joel Clears Throat, Sighs]
[Heavy Sigh]
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
[Sighs] Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
[Sighs] Oh, God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
[Laughing] Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
[Sighs] I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just...
I was just...
[Sighs] I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
[Door Slams] Clem?
[Computer Beeps] [Stan] Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
[Patrick] Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
[Patrick] I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...
[Clicks Tongue] Yeah.
[Keyboard Typing]
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is...
is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
[Laughs]
You gotta be...
[Engine Starts]
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
[Engine Knocking]
[Patrick] Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
[Stan] No, I think it's... funny.
[Patrick] So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
[Stan] Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
[Patrick] Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
[Stan] That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
[Patrick] Right.
[Stan] Yeah.
[Stan Chuckling] Was.
We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
[Laughing] What?
You little fuck...
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
[Patrick] They were clean!
[Stan] What?
D-Don't!
Stop!
[Patrick] Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
[Stan] We got work to do.
[Computer Beeps] [Stan] Give me my papers.
[Crunching]
[Slurps]
[Patrick] There's, um...
[Sighs]
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
[Stan] You what?
[Mutters] Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical...
[Laughing] It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
[Stan Continues, Echoing] Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
[High-pitched Giggling]
[Laughing]
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
[Voice Wavering, Electronically Altered] I don't see anyone.
[Clock Ticking]
[TV:
Man Talking, Audience Laugh Track] [Clementine]Joel?
Where are my boots?
[TV:
Man] Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
[Laugh Track Continues]
[TV:
Grandpa Munster] Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
[TV:
Grandpa Munster] First thing to do is...
[Chuckles] sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
[Chuckles] Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
[Scoffs] What?
[Mutters] I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
[Whispering] I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
[Whispering] I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God...
Mmm!
[Voice Echoing] It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
[Voice Fading, Echoing] Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...
[Doorbell Rings]
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
[Stan] Find us okay?
[Mary] Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
[Typing On Keyboard] [Patrick Whispering] Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
[Mock Whispering] [Stan Laughing]
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
[Clink]
[Laughing] Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
[Patrick Laughing] Mmm!
[Groans]
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
[Crash] [Mary Laughs] God!
[Patrick Laughing] Can you wake him up?
[Patrick Laughing] You can't wake him up.
[Patrick Continues Laughing] [Stan Yells]
Mmm.
[Moans]
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
[Clementine] I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
[Joel's Voice] November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
[Whispers] I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
[Joel's Voice] She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
[Phone Beep Dialing]
[Line Ringing] [Stan] Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
[Patrick] Hey, Tangerine.
[Clementine On Phone] Oh, Patrick, it's you.
[Sighs] I'm so miserable right now.
[Patrick] Why?
What's wrong?
[Clementine] I don't know.
[Voice Electronically Altered] Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you find something, sir?
[Patrick] Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
[Voice Electronically Altered] Baby, come here.
[Patrick] Scared of what?
[Clementine] Do you love me?
[Patrick] Of course I do.
[Whispers] Where's the self-help section?
[Clementine Sobbing] Do you think I'm ugly?
[Patrick] No!
You're beautiful!
[Dishes Rattle]
Maybe I should come over.
[Clementine] No, no.
I don't know.
I
- I'm a mess, Patrick.
[Patrick] Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
[Clementine] Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
[Garbled] Let him go, Stan!
[Garbled] Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
[Laughing] Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm!
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
[Mary] This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
[Beeping]
To let people begin again.
[Punches Keys]
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
## [Rock] [Giggling]
[Answering Machine:
Joel] Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
[Beeps]
[Patrick On Answering Machine] Pick up!
Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[Laughing]
## [Continues]
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
[Continues Giggling]
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
[Muttering] Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
What?
thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It...
It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
[Sighs] Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her, [Sniffles]
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
[Joel's Voice] Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
[Clementine] I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
[Clementine Whoops] Stop it!
[Clementine Laughing]
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
[Stereo:
Man] # When you ain't got nothing to do #
# I think I'll marry you ##
[Screaming] Is anybody there?
[Loud Groaning]
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement...
Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
[Clementine] Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
[Mierzwiak] Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
[Joel] Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then...
What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why...
No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
[Dog Barking]
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
[Joel] Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
[Grunts] Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
[Door Closes] I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
[Grunting]
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
[Dog Barks]
I'm here!
[Screams]
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
[Laughing]
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
[Mary Laughs] Don't!
That tickles me!
[Stan] Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
[Mary] It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You...
You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
[Beeping] [Clementine] Joel?
[Joel] Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
[Sighs] Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
[Scoffs] Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.

Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
[Woman] Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
[Woman #2] Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
Wow!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
[Laughing]
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
[Grunting] Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
[Angry Grunt] Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
[Sobbing]
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
[Crying] I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
[Buzzing]
[Buzzing] It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's...
There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
[Phone Rings]
[Rings]
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
[Stan] I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
[Bottles Clinking]
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary...
Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
[Blubbering]
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just...
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You...
You're kind,
[Sobbing] beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
[Groans]
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
[Chuckles] [Doorbell Ringing]
[Clears Throat]
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
[Clears Throat]
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already...
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
# Oh, my darling Oh, my darling #
# Oh, my darling Clementine #
# You were lost and gone forever # I love being bathed in the sink.
# Dreadful sorry, Clementine ## Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
[Giggling] Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
[Grunts]
[Gagging]
[Coughing]
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- [Stan] No.
Oh, this is...
this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
[Gasps, Panting]
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
[Mierzwiak] Okay, we're back in.
[Mary] Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
[Kissing Sounds] [Kissing Sounds]
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
[Giggling]
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
[Crying] What, Joel...
What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
[Tires Screech]
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
[Distorted Voice] All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
[Sighs] Come on, Clem.
[Stan's Voice] He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
[Boy] Come on, you big baby!
[Joel's Voice] I'm sorry, okay?
[Angry Voices Overlapping]
[Joel's Voice] Let me drive you home.
[Child Yells]
No!
- [Mary] Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
[Mary] I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.
[Sighs] I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just...
Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
[Wheezing Laugh] Good night, sweetheart.
[Laughing Continues] No.
I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.
[Children Shouting]
Hit it!
Hit it!
[Joel] I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
[Shouting Continues]
Come on, you big sissy!
[Shouting Stops]
[Sobbing]
[Children] Ooh!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
[Groaning] Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!
[Joel's Voice] I'm so ashamed.
[Clementine's Voice] It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live...
lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
[Both Groaning]
Oh, my mom.
It's...
It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
[Grunts]
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
[Gasps]
Clem!
[Grunting]
[Muffled Grunting]
[Groans]
[Growling]
Jo...
Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
[Laughing]
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
[Clementine Giggling]
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
[Shouts]
What's wrong with you?
[Laughing]
Let go of me, Joel!
[Grunts]
I like watching you work, Howard.
[Chuckles]
[Grunts] I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh... that's fine.
[Door Closes] Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's...
It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I
- I
- I
- I
- I...
I'm happy to hear...
[Sighs] I'm sorry.
[Sighing]
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's...
You're a wonderful girl.
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
[Honking]
[Mary] What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
[Sighs]
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
[Engine Starts]
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You could...
Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
[Stan] Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
[Mierzwiak] Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
[Mary] Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
[Mierzwiak] We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
[Mary Crying] Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
[Joel] This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
# Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine #
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
[Clementine] You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
[Giggling] There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
We're...
[Laughing] Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
[Tapping Phone Receiver Button]
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
[Sighs]
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
[Chuckling]
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
[Wind Howling] I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
[Joel's Voice] I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
[Clementine] I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
[Joel's Voice] I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
[Clementine] Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
[Joel] I love you.
[Whispering] Meet me in Montauk.
[Rob] I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
[Carrie] You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
[Rob] It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
[Carrie] You're stoned, and you're driving.
[Rob] Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
[Carrie] Honey, just watch the road.
[Rob] I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
[Beep]
Okay.
[Groans]
[Line Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
[Horn Honks]
[Van Door Closes, Engine Starts]
[Groaning]
[Sighs]
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
[Sighs, Clears Throat] Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
[Man On P.A., Indistinct]
Aah!
[Man On P.A.] Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just...
[Beeps]
[Patrick On Tape] Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
[Chuckles]
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
[Mary's Voice] To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
[Mary's Voice Overlapping] I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.
[Mary] In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
[On Tape] My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...
[Exasperated Sigh]
[Door Closes]
[Panting]
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
[Sobbing]
[Sets Brake]
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Joel On Tape] Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
because she would pronounce... library "libary." Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
[On Tape] I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
[On Tape] I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
[Quiet Sob]
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
[Crying]
Okay.
Okay.
[Laughing]

Montauk train on track "B."
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
Last call... to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my fixirst entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
[Joel Continues] Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine
You were lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine
No?
I'm sorry.
Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...
No, no.
I just...
Sure.
No.
That's okay.
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
Hi.
I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
Um...
Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could...
Sounds good.
But I...
I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really...
I'm...
I...
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
[Clementine] Isn't it?
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh!
Oh, my ass!
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
[Whispers] Come on.
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or...
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um...
Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just...
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.
I need your lovin'
Like the sunshine
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
[Man #1] We're looking for 159.
[Man #2] What number's that?
[Man #1] I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...
[Man #2] Is that him?
[Man #1] I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
Hey, Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.
[Man #1 Singing, Falsetto] [Man #2] Patrick, stop it.
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Whew.
Okay.
Showtime at the Apollo.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey.
Quiet.
[Frank] Hey, Joel.
What's up?
[Joel] Oh.
Hi, Frank.
[Sighs] I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh, no!
[Joel] Yes!
Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
[Patrick] Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
- [Patrick] Hi.
How are you?
[Clementine] Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
Uh-huh.
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too...
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
[Woman] Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's aboutJoel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
Okay.
What is it?
[Rob] I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
[Woman] Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- [Mutters] Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo!
Oh, my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
I assure you, no.
[Woman] No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
[Dr. Mierzwiak] We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Oww!
Fuck!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
[Woman] Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll fixind yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you.
Wake up, buddy!
[Mary] No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
There's a good story behind this one...
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
[Stan] Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
- That's so...
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
[Chuckles]
- Next item.
Okay.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
[Stan] Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
[Patrick] Yeah.
[Stan] Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm...
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...
Underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- [Stan] A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- [Stan] Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
[Patrick] How's that?
[Mary] How are you today, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
[Stan's Voice] That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
[Stan's Voice, Electronically Accelerated] "I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing. "
Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
[Sighs] Oh, God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just...
I was just...
I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
Clem?
Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
[Patrick] Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
[Patrick] I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...
Yeah.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is...
is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be...
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
[Patrick] Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
[Stan] No, I think it's... funny.
[Patrick] So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
[Stan] Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
[Patrick] Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
[Stan] That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
[Patrick] Right.
[Stan] Yeah.
[Stan Chuckling] Was.
We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
What?
You little fuck...
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
[Patrick] They were clean!
[Stan] What?
D-Don't!
Stop!
[Patrick] Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
[Stan] We got work to do.
[Computer Beeps] [Stan] Give me my papers.
[Patrick] There's, um...
[Sighs]
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
[Stan] You what?
[Mutters] Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical...
[Laughing] It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
[Stan Continues, Echoing] Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel?
Where are my boots?
[TV:
Man] Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
[TV:
Grandpa Munster] Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
[TV:
Grandpa Munster] First thing to do is...
[Chuckles] Sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
[Whispering] I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God...
Mmm!
[Voice Echoing] It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
[Voice Fading, Echoing] Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
[Stan] Find us okay?
[Mary] Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
[Typing On Keyboard] [Patrick Whispering] Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
[Mock Whispering] [Stan Laughing]
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
[Patrick Laughing] Mmm!
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
[Crash] [Mary Laughs] God!
[Patrick Laughing] Can you wake him up?
[Patrick Laughing] You can't wake him up.
[Patrick Continues Laughing] [Stan Yells]
Mmm.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
[Clementine] I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or...
Iove?
[Joel's Voice] November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
[Joel's Voice] She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- Gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
[Patrick] Hey, Tangerine.
[Clementine On Phone] Oh, Patrick, it's you.
[Sighs] I'm so miserable right now.
[Patrick] Why?
What's wrong?
[Clementine] I don't know.
[Voice Electronically Altered] Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you fixind something, sir?
[Patrick] Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fixine.
[Voice Electronically Altered] Baby, come here.
[Patrick] Scared of what?
[Clementine] Do you love me?
[Patrick] Of course I do.
[Whispers] Where's the self-help section?
[Clementine Sobbing] Do you think I'm ugly?
[Patrick] No!
You're beautiful!
[Dishes Rattle]
Maybe I should come over.
[Clementine] No, no.
I don't know.
I
- I'm a mess, Patrick.
[Patrick] Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
[Clementine] Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm!
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
[Mary] This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
[Answering Machine:
Joel] Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up!
Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[Laughing]
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
[Continues Giggling]
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
What?
Thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It...
It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
[Joel's Voice] Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
[Clementine] I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
[Stereo:
Man] When you ain't got nothing to do
I think I'll marry you
Is anybody there?
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement...
Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
[Clementine] Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
[Mierzwiak] Look, our fixiles are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
[Joel] Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then...
What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why...
No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
[Joel] Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
[Screams]
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
[Laughing]
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
[Mary Laughs] Don't!
That tickles me!
[Stan] Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
[Mary] It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one ofJoel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You...
You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
[Beeping] [Clementine] Joel?
[Joel] Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Row, row, row your boat [Both] Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream [Boy] Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat
It's working!
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream [Clementine] I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
[Woman] Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
[Woman #2] Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
Wow!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
[Laughing]
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, babyJoel.
Hey, Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
[Angry Grunt] Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
[Sobbing]
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, babyJoel.
BabyJoel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's...
There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
[Stan] I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
[Bottles Clinking]
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary...
Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just...
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You...
You're kind,
Beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
[Groans]
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already...
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
Oh, my darling Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine
You were lost and gone forever I love being bathed in the sink.
Dreadful sorry, Clementine Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, babyJoel.
[Giggling] Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- [Stan] No.
Oh, this is...
this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
[Mierzwiak] Okay, we're back in.
[Mary] Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
[Kissing Sounds] [Kissing Sounds]
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel...
What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
[Tires Screech]
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
[Distorted Voice] All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
[Boy] Come on, you big baby!
[Joel's Voice] I'm sorry, okay?
[Angry Voices Overlapping]
[Joel's Voice] Let me drive you home.
[Child Yells]
No!
- [Mary] Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
[Mary] I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just...
Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
[Wheezing Laugh] Good night, sweetheart.
No.
I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.
Hit it!
Hit it!
[Joel] I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Come on, you big sissy!
[Children] Ooh!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!
[Joel's Voice] I'm so ashamed.
[Clementine's Voice] It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live...
lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
[Both Groaning]
Oh, my mom.
It's...
It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
[Grunts]
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo...
Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work, Howard.
I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh... that's fixine.
[Door Closes] Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's...
It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned. "
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I-I-I-I-I...
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's...
You're a wonderful girl.
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
[Mary] What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You could...
Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
[Stan] Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
[Mierzwiak] Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
[Mary] Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at fixirst.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
[Mierzwiak] We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
[Mary Crying] Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
[Joel] This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I couldjust make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back. "
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
[Clementine] You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
[Giggling] There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
We're...
Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
[Wind Howling] I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
[Joel's Voice] I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
[Clementine] I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
[Joel's Voice] I ran back to the bonfixire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
[Clementine] Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
[Rob] I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
[Carrie] You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
[Rob] It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
[Carrie] You're stoned, and you're driving.
[Rob] Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
[Carrie] Honey, just watch the road.
[Rob] I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
[Horn Honks]
[Van Door Closes, Engine Starts]
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
[Man On P.A., Indistinct]
Aah!
[Man On P.A.] Montauk train now boarding on track "B."All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just...
[Patrick On Tape] Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
[Mary's Voice] To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.
[Mary] In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's fixile back to them.
[On Tape] My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Joel On Tape] Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
Because she would pronounce... library "libary." Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
[On Tape] I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
[On Tape] I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to fixind out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
[Laughing]

"Today is a holiday invented by greeting-card companies

"I ditched work today.
"Took a train out to Montauk.
"I don't know why.
"I'm not an impulsive person.
"I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.

Hi, Cindy.
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
Food poisoning, I think.
"It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
"Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
"Pages ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
"It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
"If only I could meet someone new.
"I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished,
"since I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
"Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
"She was nice.
Nice is good.
"She loved me.
"Why do I fall in love with every woman I see
"who shows me the least bit of attention?"
Hi.
I'm sorry?
I just said hi.
Hi, hello.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
- Rockville Center.
- Get out.
Me, too.
- Really?
- What are the odds?
Listen, do I know you?
- Do you ever shop at Barnes and Noble?
- Sure.
That's it!
I've seen you, man.
Book slave there for five years now.
I would have thought I would remember you.
- It might be the hair.
- What might?
It changes a lot, the color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
- It's called Blue Ruin.
- Right.
- The color.
Snappy name, huh?
- I like it.
This company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
You've got Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That would be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
15 maybe?
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange.
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
- I doubt that very much.
- Well, you don't know me, so you don't know, do you?
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
- My name's Clementine, by the way.
- I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no.
You wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
- I don't know what that means.
- Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
#Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling Clementine!
#
#You are lost and gone forever.
Dreadful sorry, Clementine!
#
I'm sorry.
It's a pretty name, though.
It means merciful, right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
- I wouldn't think that about you.
- Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
You seem nice.
Now I'm nice?
Oh, God, don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need nice.
I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anybody to be it at me.
Okay.
- It's Joel, right?
- Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
Adesso, voglio dire.
Non saprei dirti che cosa mi piacerà fra un momento, però... but right now
I'm glad you are.
I have some stuff that I probably should...
- I'm writing...
- I'm sorry.
Sure.
That's okay.
- Take care, then.
- Jesus.
Hi!
I could give you a ride if you need.
It's cold.
- Yeah!
- Okay.
It is frosty.
- You're not a stalker or anything, right?
- You're the one that talked to me, remember?
- That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
- Really?
There's a stalker book?
I've got to read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sort of nutso.
I'm not really.
That's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Do you want to have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could...
Never mind.
Sorry, that was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
- Thank you.
- Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kind of close-mouthed, aren't you?
- I'm sorry.
You know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
I don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest.
Taking advantage of every possibility and making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
- I think about that.
- Yeah?
You're really nice.
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic, a night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
That sounds good.
But I should go now.
- You should stay.
- No, I really have...
I have to get up so early and...
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I'd like it.
- Yes.
- Ok.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call.
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
- I just walked in.
You miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
You said "I do." I guess that means we're married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
- I don't know.
- Come on!
It's so beautiful.
Isn't it?
Don't go too far.
Are you okay?
Shit!
Oh, my ass!
- I think I should go back.
- Come on!
- Come on!
- But what if it breaks?
"What if?" Do you really care right now?
Come here, please.
Slidey-slidey.
Slidey-slidey.
This looks good.
- Let me show you this one thing.
- What are you doing?
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not going to crack.
Or break.
iIt's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
I don't know any.
- Show me which ones you know.
- Okay.
- There's Osidius.
- Where?
Right there.
See?
A sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
- You're full of shit, right?
- No.
Osidius, right there.
- Swoop and a cross.
- Shut the fuck up!
Clementine?
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Sorry to wake you, but we're here.
Can I come over to your house, to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yes?
- Can I help you?
- What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Thanks.
- We're looking for 150.
- What number is that?
I don't know what number that is.
Jesus Christ.
You'd think they'd light the number
- Is that him?
- I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
That's him.
- Hey, Joel.
- Frank.
Shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine.
She is way cool.
You got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's, right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
- I have to go to sleep now, Frank.
- It's 8:30.
Patrick, stop it.
Okay.
Show time at the Apollo.
Quiet.
Get it off your head.
- CHey, Joel.
What's up?
- Hi, Frank.
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
You got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation somewhere.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Valentine's Day is three days away.
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early Valentine.
And you won't believe it.
She's there with this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy!
- What are you doing here, baby?
- Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
- How are you?
- Pretty good, pretty bored, pretty tired.
- I so want what's in your suit.
- Good.
Why would she do that to me?
Does anybody want a joint?
God, Rob, give it a rest.
- God, she's punishing me.
- I know.
- For being honest.
- It's horrible.
- I should just go to her house.
- You don't want to go there, man.
Get off me.
- It's too...
- Right.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign?
Make a clean break.
Right?
All right, Joel.
- Look, man, seriously, here's the deal.
- Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
What's your fucking suggestion?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're making this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult, okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
Why don't you go do your laundry?
That's great.
That's good.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the New Year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the 5th?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
- I'm Joel Barish.
.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel Barish.
I have an appointment with Doctor...
Mierzwiak.
Here, can you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
- You still need to fill the form out, sir.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- I don't have a pen.
- There's a pen right there.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Yeah, that offer, that's done now.
That expired after the New Year.
Mr. Barish?
- How are we today?
- Not too good, actually.
- Oh, my God!
Stan!
- Sorry, I was just...
I'm working.
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
- This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem's...
- I assure you, no.
No.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss Kruczynski was not happy and she wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
"We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
I'm the nicest guy she ever went out with.
Fuck!
Rob, give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say?
You know, Clementine's just like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark?
Why?
Why?
!
Why did you do that?
Don't.
Wait.
I'm sorry, Doctor, he just barged right in here.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time...
That's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to come inside.
If you'd take care of Mrs. Woo.
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.
The first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... ..and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
We'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain, okay?
We'll need photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home, we want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened, a new life awaiting you.
Wake up, buddy!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
It's just not our policy here.
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello, I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency.
We'll do everything we can.
We can fit you in on March 1.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor and...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Maybe tomorrow would be better, around 12:15.
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
This is Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
- He'll be handling your case tonight.
- Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now tell me about Clementine.
I was living with this woman, Naomi, a couple years ago.
And my friends, Rob and Carrie, invited us to this party at the beach.
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went.
And I met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
We'll start with your most recent memories and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core, it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted... ..will have withered and disappeared.
As in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage.
But it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
There's a good story behind that...
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional read-out if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
- Just please try to focus on the memories.
- I'm sorry.
Healthy activity up there again.
- Healthy read-outs.
- Very good.
Here's another object.
Next item.
Potato head.
Next item.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
Patrick, do me a favor, will you?
Can you check the voltage regulator?
- What have we got there?
- Voltage looks fine.
I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
Technically, the procedure is brain damage.
Check the connections, please.
There you are.
What am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here...
Oh, my God, deja vu.
If we want to get the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
This is about right.
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
- Patrick?
- Yeah?
- Why are there so many wires?
- Because we have a lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
How's that?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
All right, that's better.
I don't know if I like this.
I think I might try this then.
We're almost done now.
Your journal.
That'll be invaluable.
"I met someone tonight.
Her name is Clementine and she's amazing."
Jesus!
- What?
- Come on, careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
It's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
- All right.
We got that one.
- This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
Well, not a dump then, but sort of plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Can we just please get through this?
We've got a long night ahead of us.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kind of, sort of wrecked your car.
Driving drunk.
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic!
It is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
You could have killed somebody.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Should I check the grille to see if there's children or small animals?
- You're like an old lady or something.
- What are you like?
- A wino?
- A "wino"?
Jesus.
Are you from the '50s or something?
A "wino"?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out... ..becouse I was out late without you.
And in your little, wormy brain, you're trying to figure out,
"Did she fuck someone tonight?"
Now, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry, okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it, all right?
Your keys.
I won't need them anymore.
I was just angry or annoyed or something.
I don't know.
Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
Just thought you'd want to know.
I like when she comes to visit.
I don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
So maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
- Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
- We gotta focus here, Patrick.
The thing is, my situation is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation
I'm sure it is.
You've got to be...
- Clem, let me drive you home.
- Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me!
God damn it!
Did you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
No, I think it's funny.
Who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the potatoes?
That girl?
Yeah, that's this guy's girl.
Right, was.
We took care of that.
I kind of fell in love with her that night.
- What?
You little fuck.
- What?
- She was unconscious, man.
- She was beautiful.
I stole a pair of her panties, as well.
- Jesus!
- What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
- Don't tell me this.
I don't want to hear this shit.
- They were clean.
- What?
Don't.
Stop.
- Okay, all right.
We've got work to do.
Hold my papers.
There's more.
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.
What?
Jesus.
Patrick!
Have an idea how unethical...
It's not really that bad.
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties.
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel, where are my boots?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
I should have left you at the flea market.
Want to go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
- No.
I want to have a baby.
- I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't want to talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
- I said I don't want to talk about this!
- We're fucking gonna talk about it!
You can't just say that and say you don't wanna talk about it.
I'd make a fucking good mother.
I love children.
I'm creative, I'm smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
t's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything.
You've no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you.
I don't even know why I am.
Maybe I should end it right here!
Leave you at the flea market with the stupid costume jewelry!
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Mary, how's it going?
- It's freezing outside.
- Did you find us okay?
Yeah.
Hot.
Poor guy.
- Don't you have anything real to drink?
- We haven't checked yet.
Let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.!
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
- There's more.
- No.
- Yes..
- No!
- You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
- No, I don't know.
That's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
- I found it in my Bartlett's.
- What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
- I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
- Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
- Can you wake him up?
- You can't wake him up.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus.
People have to share things, Joel.
That's what intimacy is.
- I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
- I'm sorry.
My life just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write if you don't have any thoughts or passions or love?
"November 19, 2003.
"Dinner at Kang's again.
"Are we like those poor couples
"you feel sorry for in restaurants?
"Are we the dining dead?"
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
- More?
- No, thank you.
She's going to be drunk and stupid now.
Would you do me a favor and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
- It's really...
- Yeah.
- It's gross.
- Gross.
I think it's just...
Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick!
- Hey, Tangerine.
- Patrick, it's you.
- I'm so miserable right now.
- Why?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I'm just confused about everything.
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
- Do you love me?
- Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
- Do you think I'm ugly?
- No.
You're beautiful.
- Maybe I should come over.
- No.
I don't know.
I'm a mess, Patrick.
- Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
- Okay.
Can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
Let him go, Stan.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
She hates me.
She wants me to go.
Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Ho preso in pieno il colore della felpa!
I like it.
You look like a tangerine.
Clementine the tangerine.
- Juicy and seedless.
- I like that.
I like tangerines.
- Can you see me doing ducks?
- Tangerine.
- How does he know to call you that?
- How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash, the only band that mattered.
- And they called themselves that for a reason.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice.
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure, so free and so clean.
Adults are this mess of sadness and phobias.
And Howard just makes it all go away.
- Baby, what's going on?
- I don't know.
I'm lost, I'm scared, I feel like I'm disappearing.
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
- You're not getting old.
- Nothing makes any sense.
Tangerine.
It's okay.
Let's go out dancing.
- You want to go out to Montauk with me?
- Montauk?
No, come up to Boston with me.
- Sure.
We can go next weekend.
- No, now.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi, it's Joel.
Leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up.
Hello?
What's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Puoi fare da solo?
Mi dispiace.
Don't worry about it.
I've got it under control.
He's pretty much on auto-pilot now, anyway.
Thanks.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I got to go.
"Look.
You and me on the Charles River.
"I could die right now, Clem.
"I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited.
I'm excited, too.
Cool.
I...
I got you this thing.
Happy early Valentine's Day.
What is it?
I don't know.
Open it up.
- It's gorgeous.
- You like it?
It's just my taste, really.
God, I've never gone out with a guy who bought me jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight, and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her, "You can't be ugly.
Be pretty."
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change, too.
You're pretty.
- Don't ever leave me.
- You're pretty.
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
I don't want to hold your hand.
Come on.
Stop it!
I could die right now.
I'm just so so happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I want to call it off.
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I want to call it off!
Is anybody there?
- What?
- We've got to go.
Where?
- I have an idea of how to stop this.
- Stop what?
Don't tickle me.
No.
Smell my pits!
Concentrate, Clem.
We have to get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Back here.
Come on.
Look at me.
I want to go there.
Our files are confidential, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss Kruczynski was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Tell me about...
- That's what he said.
- What did we see that day?
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why...
No.
We're not going on a train.
Joel, please.
Don't make me run anymore.
Mierzwiak!
Please?
Why don't we begin by you telling me everything you can remember...
Mierzwiak, wake me up!
I'm sorry, Mr. Barish, I thought you understood what was going on.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her.
You got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination, too.
How can I help you from there?
I'm inside your head, too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
- Look, who's that?
- He works for us.
That's Patrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Jesus Christ.
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
What?
Wait, Clem.
Clem!
They're erasing you.
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
- I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.
- Sweetie, calm down.
- Enjoy the scenery.
- I need it to stop
..before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
- Just tell them to cancel it then.
- What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
- Wake yourself up!
- Okay, you want me to wake up?
All right.
- Okay, here we go.
Will it make you happy if I try?
- Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
That's working like gangbusters.
Don't!
That tickles me!
- What the hell is that?
- It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second.
But I couldn't I couldn't move.
Isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
- I'm listening.
- I don't know.
You erased me.
- That's why I'm here and doing this.
- I'm sorry.
You know me, I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
- Joel?
- Mh?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me.
The way you wanted to have sex on the couch, after you look down at my crotch.
The eraser guys are coming, so so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
I can't remember anything without you.
- That's very sweet, but try, okay?
- Okay.
Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream
It's working.
I'm a genius.
Joel!
Joel!
Where did you go?
I'm supposed to come, too!
I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
It worked.
My God, look at this.
It worked.
Look at this dress, man.
I wish I could take it with me.
- Who am I?
- Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl.
I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Honey, are you all right?
I feel like I could clean up all day.
- Would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
- No, not at all.
God, I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at ne.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Ehi, Joel!
- Is every little peanut under there okay?
- He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
I know it's not 5:00...
I would die for a vodka.
- Let me check if I have that.
- Okay, I'm just going to wait right here.
No, sweetie.
Joely?
Joel?
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
- Ice cream.
- No, not until after you've had your dinner.
Come on!
Grow up.
- Don't leave me, Clem.
- No, I'm right here.
- This is sort of warped.
- I'm scared.
- I want my mommy.
- Don't cry, baby Joel.
It's okay.
Joel!
Joel, stop it!
I think it's working.
We're hidden, Joel.
Honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit!
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
- Where?
- I don't know where.
This is very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Crap!
What did we do?
- What shall we do?
- I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- I just said, I don't know.
I'm sorry.
What shall we do?
I don't know.
Mellow out.
You're freaking me out.
We have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
All gooey and half-baked.
That sounds so good.
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- We should call Howard.
No way.
No sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
- There's no time to fuck around.
- I've got this under control.
- Stop fucking around.
- Okay.
I'll call Howard.
- Hello?
- Howard, it's Stan.
I'm working on this guy down here.
We've lost him for a moment, and I can't bring him back up.
Okay, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
I wasn't sure because I was away from the monitor for a minute, and I had it on auto-pilot because I had to pee.
- Where was Patrick?
- He had to go home sick.
- What's the address?
- I know, I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.
Come on.
- We're at 159 South Village.
Apartment 1-E.
Rockville Center.
- Mary!
- Yeah?
- He's coming right now.
- I'm staying.
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying!
- I think you should go.
- I don't know.
Mary...
- I am so stoned.
- Please, Mary...
- You have to go.
- Stop being stoned.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
You have no idea how much trouble I'll get into if Howard comes...
Joel, stop.
Look.
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
Weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me.
You'll remember me in the morning, you'll come to me, you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat!
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
- That Patrick guy, he's copying me.
- What Patrick guy?
- That guy.
- What?
He's here, in my apartment.
One of the eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you,
- and you guys are dating.
- Really?
Is he cute?
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You're kind beautiful, smart, funny, and nice.
What?
Okay, all right.
Move.
Come on, let's go.
I'm still stoned.
Those eye drops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
- Hello, Mary, what are you doing here?
- Hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings
Not that I do, but the work that is done by people..
..where I also work.
The work of my colleagues.
Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this, shall we?
- That's odd.
- I already tried that.
- You tried going through the C-gate?
- Of course.
I mean, yes.
All right.
- You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
- Here, Howard, I got you a chair.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
All right.
I've got it.
I'll go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
#Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling Clementine!
#
I love being bathed in the sink.
Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
This is not good.
I'm going to have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard, like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Thank you, Mary.
Howard, you should get some sleep.
I think I'll be fine now.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
What was that?
- My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
- There is?
Got it.
Tangerine!
Come on.
We've got to go.
Go on.
Please go.
- You can run, but you can't hide.
- Clem, come on!
That truck.
Doc?
Please!
Let's begin by you telling me everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
At least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
He's developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
- Come on.
- Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby.
- Bye, Howard.
- Wait.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Joel!
I don't like it, either.
I'm trying to find horrible secret places to...
Honey, I have a surprise.
You know what?
I'll just ask you in the morning.
Good night.
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.
Look.
Joel!
- What?
- Look where we are.
This isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere really buried.
Hit it, Joel!
I can't, I've got to go home.
I'll do it later!
He has a girlfriend.
Wait, what am I doing?
Freddy, you don't scare me anymore.
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
He's not listening!
Come on.
Stupid!
- I'm so ashamed.
- It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Come on.
That's where I live, lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
- You're really going to die, though, okay?
- One, two, three.
You're dead.
My mom.
- It's okay, we're playing.
It's not real.
- He's killing me.
Are you dead yet?
You're dead!
I think I got the hang of this.
I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Joel!
Are you okay?
Joel?
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
Almost three seconds.
- Vediamo che si può fare.
- Un'altra volta, poi tocca a me.
This is so cool!
Look out!
It's fluff.
Our house.
Wait, we've got to go.
Come on.
This is a really bad time for this.
- I don't even know where we're going.
- It's going to be fun.
It's the best place.
- No, this way
- This way.
Come on.
You're no help at all.
Come on.
Let go of me, Joel.
I like watching you work, Howard.
I guess I'll go out for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's fine.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Like famous quotes.
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
- That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.
I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
No, it's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
There's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander"
and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!
"The world forgetting by the world forgot
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!
"Each pray'r accepted and each wish resign'd"
I want to be a great, big, huge elephant.
With a huge trunk like that.
Clem!
Clementine!
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do.
- I don't mean to be so familiar...
- It's fine.
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Mary, you're a wonderful girl.
But, you know, I have a wife and kids.
Mary!
Mary, we can't do this.
Good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
- What?
Who is it?
- Oh, my God.
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
- I knew it, Howard.
- It didn't start out like this.
I came here to work.
This is a one-time mistake.
I'm a stupid girl with a crush.
I basically forced him into it.
Don't be a monster.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
We have a history.
I'm sorry.
You wanted the procedure.
You wanted it done so you could get past...
I have to finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later, okay?
Let me give you a lift home.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I thought you were humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
- I just needed to see you.
- Yeah?
I'd like to take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
Look, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them or I'm gonna make them alive.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.
- I had you pegged, didn't I?
- Had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were going to save my life.
Even after that.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go-round.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Just tell me what you remember, and we'll take it from there.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first, but I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids...
Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
- Yeah, I know.
Oh, God!
I'll take the bottom and you...
No, Joel, help me with that.
- Will you get the cooler?
- Honey, the cooler's pretty...
- She can get it.
- Let me get that.
No, no, no.
- Don't take anything.
- I can take the plane.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you, even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd!
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well, and even hate, eventually.
But at the time I thought, "How cool, an orange sweatshirt."
Hi, there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here by yourself, and I thought,
"Thank God, someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things."
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it, without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
- I'm Joel.
- Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean, like #Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling Clementine!
#
- Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?
- Yeah, like that.
No, no jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
- You married?
- No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone, though.
- Male or female?
- What?
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
- Do you know these people?
- No, of course not.
Come on.
- They might have a dog.
- There's no dog.
- What are you doing?
- It's freezing out.
I don't believe this.
Clementine!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me.
So, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
- I think we should go.
- There's no phone line.
What?
- I think we should go.
- Why?
It's our house.
Just for tonight.
We are David and Ruth Laskin.
Which one do you want to be?
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What do you need?
Alcohol.
- So, are you okay with wine?
- I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'll go find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth.
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- We really should go.
I've got to catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut.
But you were exciting.
- I wish you'd stayed.
- I wish I'd stayed, too.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
- I came back downstairs and you were gone.
- I walked out the door.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
It was above my head.
- You were scared?
- Yeah.
I thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.
- Was it something I said?
- Yeah.
You said "So go" with such disdain.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Joely!
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a goodbye.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and it crashed.
- It was fucking windy.
Come on.
- You're stoned and you're driving.
The pot balances it out and brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
It does.
A medical test was done.
It's proven on the Science Network.
- Honey, just watch the road.
- I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to a pretty girl.
- She was nice.
- Yeah, man, who was it?
She was just a girl.
Okay.
- So I've got to drop the van off.
- Thanks, Stan.
We'll talk.
Ehi!
- You've got all your stuff, I see.
- That's right.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you.
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I swear.
- So you didn't do the erasing?
- Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car, and I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled.
How did I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just figured I was imagining things.
the train to Montauk will depart from platform 4 from 1 minute.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
I feel like you're mad at me and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
I'm going to stop by this morning, just to make sure you're okay.
Let's go, mister.
I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
"To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
"I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased.
"I've since decided that this is a horrible...
"To correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them."
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
- What is this?
\
- I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking how I was before and how I am now, and he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
That sort of wounded puppy shit.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
You clearly are!
Let's just take a minute and...
Patrick, get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away from me!
- Can we talk about it?
- No, get the fuck away!
Joel Barish....
Ehi, Clementine!
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't talk to her about books.
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
The truth is, I was embarrassed in public,
Hi.
Because she would pronounce "library," "li-berry."
Hi.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
Made me look skinny.
An amazing, burning meteorite will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that it's really an elaborate ruse.
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- It's okay.
I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- That's only fair.
The whole thing with the hair, it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I do.
- You want a drink or something?
- Do you have any whiskey?
I didn't think her sex was motivated.
lI saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sexy.
It was just sad.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her is to fuck them.
Or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of them.
I think she's so desperate and insecure that she'll sooner or later
.. go around fucking everybody.
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
- It hurts me that you said that, because I don't do that.
- I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm going to go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
- Bye.
- Bye.
It was nice meeting you and all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
- What?
- I don't know.
Just wait.
- What do you want, Joel?
- I want you to wait for a while.
- Okay.
- Really?
I'm not a concept, just a fucked-up girl..
..looking for my peace of mind.
I'm not perfect.
I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
- But you will.
- Right now I can't.
You will think of things.
And I'll get bored with you and feel trapped, because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Montauk train on track "B."
Random thoughts for valentine's Day 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
Last call-- to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen I don't feel very well today.
No food poisoning I think.
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February..
Brilliant Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry. in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you man!
Book slave there for like five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red-
- Red Menace Yellow Fever Green Revolution.
That'd be a job coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh I doubt that very much.
Well you don't know me so... you don't know do you?
Sorry.
I was just-- I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
My name's Clementine by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh no you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you nuts?
It's been suggested.
Oh my darlin' oh my darlin' Oh my darlin' Clementine
You were lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine
No?
I'm sorry.
Just-- It's a pretty name though.
It really is nice.
It's uh-- It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch truth be told.
Gee I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just--
I don't know.
I just uh--
You seem nice so--
Oh now I'm nice?
Oh God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like but right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that uh I probably should uh--
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing and--
No no.
I just-- Sure.
No.
That's okay.
I just have-- You know this is-- Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care then.
Jesus!
Hi.
I could uh give you a ride if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not really.
Oh it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks and I could um--
Um--
Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No no no no.
Good nightJoel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just you know my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest taking advantage of every possibility making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
You're really nice.
God I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Um... okay.
Joel you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And um we could--
Sounds good.
But I-
- I should uh go.
Now.
You should stay.
No I really-
- I'm-
- I--
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough I do.
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on come on.
Oh.
So beautiful.
Isn't it?
Uh don't go too far.
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Oh my ass!
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
Come here.
Please.
Come on.
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
This is good.
Here let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or--
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you but we're... here.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Um yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just--
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Thanks.
I need your lovin'
Like the sunshine
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Every.body's gotta learn sometime
Every.body's gotta learn sometime
We're looking for 159.
What number's that?
I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ you'd think they'd light the number or at least put a number on--
Is that him?
I think so.
Yeah that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
Hey Joel.
Frank.
Oh shit.
Jesus.
The only valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine man.
She is way cool.
Hey you got any big valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to uh go to sleep now Frank.
It's 8:30.
Patrick stop it.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Showtime at the Apollo.
Quiet.
Hey Joel.
What's up?
Oh.
Hi Frank.
I only get valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine Joel.
Hey you got uh any uh big valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh no!
Yes!
valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic you know to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work give her an early valentine and--
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something sir?
Hey Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here baby?
Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something sir.
You look good.
- Hi.
How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey does anybody want a joint?
Oh God Rob give it a rest.
Oh God.
She's punishing me.
I know honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No!
No no no.
You don't wanna go there man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too--
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel why don't you just see this as a sign make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
All rightJoel look man seriously.
Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob what are you doing?
No no no no.
What's your fucking suggestion Carrie?
What's your brilliant reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you--
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
Okay.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
No I'm sorry..
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah sure.
We can fit you in--
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right great.
Could you spell that please?
Okay and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr.--
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Ohyeah that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good actually.
Noo!
Oh my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry I was just-- I'm working!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Here Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax right?
I mean this is Clem--
I assure you no.
No.
There's no such thing as this.
Look our files are confidential Mr. Barish so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss uh-- Miss Kruczynski was not happy and she wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Fuck!
God Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie I am making a birdhouse.
What can I sayJoel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Wait wait wait wait!
I'm sorry Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh th-th-that's-- that's okay Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish if you'd like to uh-- to come inside.
And Mary if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye Mrs. Woo.
Yes of course.
Now the uh-- the first thing we need you to do Mr. Barish is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need uh uh photos clothing gifts books she may have bought you CDs you may have bought together
Journal entries.
We want to empty your home--
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way when you awake in the morning you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened-- a new life awaiting you.
Wake up buddy!
No I'm sorry Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well it's just not our policy-- How are you today Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency and we'll do everything we can-- We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor a-and he--
All right so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of valentine's Day.
This is uh Stan Fink one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
very good.
Now tell me about uh Clementine.
Uh I was... living with this woman Naomi uh a couple years ago and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach-- I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go but I went... and I uh met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well uh technically speaking the procedure is brain damage but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here Mr. Barish is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure under way tonight we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects Mr. Barish if you will.
There's a good story behind this one--
Uh actually Mr. Barish I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. very. good.
- Here's another object.
That's so--
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
- Next item.
Okay.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick do me a favor.
Hey Patrick do me a favor will ya?
Yeah.
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm--
Well uh technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the uh-- Check the connections please.
Oh there you are.
I --
Why am I -- I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and--
Oh my God.
Déjà-vu.
Déjà-vu.
This is so--
All right we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh this is about right.
This is what it-- This is what it would look like.
very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Patrick can you check-- Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
How's that?
How are you today Mr. Barish?
There we are Mr. Barish.
All right that's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this then.
We're almost done now.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine and she's amazing."
- Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump don't you think?
It's an apartment Patrick.
Patrick.
Well not a dump then but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
Jesus are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight?
No see Clem
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry..
Okay?
Clem I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just-
- I was just-- I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something I don't know.
Clem?
Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
I like Mary..
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have--
Yeah.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here Patrick.
Yeah the thing is our situation is-- is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be--
Clem let me drive you home.
Get out of my face faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
No I think it's... funny.
So who do you think's better-looking me or this guy?
Patrick let's focus buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
Right.
Yeah.
Was.
We took care of that.
Oh God!
Well uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
What?
You little fuck--
What?
She was unconscious man.
Well she was beautiful and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like--
I mean they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
They were clean!
What?
D-Don't!
Stop!
Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
We got work to do.
Give me my papers.
There's um--
There's more.
After we did her I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
You what?
Jesus.
Jesus Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical--
It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
Patrick you stole a girl's panties!
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel?
Where are my boots?
Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions" I said.
Potions.
Love potion please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
First thing to do is-- sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to--
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
I'm sorry Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh God--
It's you Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
Maybe I should end this right hereJoel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain confusion--
Oh.
Hi Patrick.
Hi Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey you.
Oh it's freezing outside.
Find us okay?
Yeah.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh yeah.
Uh let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey hey!
Oh you didn't want any did you Patrick?
Uh no that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
God!
Can you wake him up?
You can't wake him up.
You don't tell me things Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share thingsJoel.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just-- really just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
November 19 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just--
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick can we get through this?
Patrick.
Hey Tangerine.
Oh Patrick it's you.
I'm so miserable right now.
Why?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you find something sir?
Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
Baby come here.
Scared of what?
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
Do you think I'm ugly?
No!
You're beautiful!
Maybe I should come over.
No no.
I don't know.
I-I'm a mess Patrick.
Well just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's--
Let him go Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over Tangerine.
You like?
Oh man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh my God.
Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash-- the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing isn't it?
Like social justice-- Yeah it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are like this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh my God.
Baby what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost I'm scared
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
.
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi it's Joel.
Um leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up!
Pick up man!
Hold on hold on hold on.
Hello?
Yeah what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control man.
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want--"
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh uh I uh--
I got you this...
What?
thing um--
Happy early valentine's Day.
Wow.
What is it?
Uh I don't know.
Open it up.
It-
- It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
When I was a kid I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So I'm eight... and I have these toys these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Mierzwiak please let me keep this memory..
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Stop it!
I could die right now Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
.
Can you hear me?
I don't want this any more!
I wanna call it off!
.
When you ain't got nothing to do
I think I'll marry you
Is anybody there?
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement-- Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
Oh look at me.
Hey I look good there.
Look our files are confidential Mr. Barish so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss uh-- Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then-- What did we see that day?
No wait.
Oh look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel why-
- No I don't want to-- Joel please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
Please.
So why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh I-I'm sorry Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her--
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh he-he works for us.
That's uh Pa-a-a-a-atrick baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's uh seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
OhJesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
Clem focus.
I hired them okay?
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay well you know just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy that's working like gangbusters.
Don't!
That tickles me!
Oh my goodness.
Oh my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the--
It's a birthmark!
I t did work for a second but I couldn't-- I couldn't move.
See?
Oh well isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually--
Look I don't want to discuss this right now okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You-
- You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel the eraser guys are coming here so what if you take me somewhere else somewhere where I don't belong and we hide there till morning?
Oh man.
I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk that's very sweet but try okay?
Okay.
Row row row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Row row row your boat gently down the stream
Row row row your boat Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Life is but a dream Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Life is but a dream Row row row your boat
- It's working!
Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
- I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God look at this!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress man!
Oh my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh my gosh.
Found the salad bowl so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut are you all right?
God honestly I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No not at all.
Oh my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh baby Joel.
Hey Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey no sweetie.
Uh Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No not until after you know you've had your dinner.
Come on Joel!
Joel grow up!
Don't leave me Clem.
Oh my God Clem.
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry baby Joel.
Baby Joel it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look I think it's working.
Look we're hidden Joel.
Look!
Hey honey look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now look you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
All gooey and-- and half-baked.
Hmm that sounds so good.
Oh shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh shit.
What?
Oh!
What what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No sir man.
This is my-- I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's-
- There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay I'll call Howard.
Hello.
Hello Howard?
Hey it's Stan.
Um I'm working on this guy down here and we seem to have lost him for a moment and uh I can't-- I can't bring him back up.
Okay uh tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well I wasn't sure really 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to uh--
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah geez.
Okay what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
I'm at 159 South village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1E.
Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
- Get your stuff Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell no.
Mary-
- Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes-- I look like shit!
Joely stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning and you'll come to me and you'll tell me about us and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just-
- Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy-- he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You-
- You're kind beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Move move move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful careful.
Fine.
Oh my God.
I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh hi Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well not that I do but the work that is done... by people... where I also work the work of my colleagues.
All right well let's see if we can uh get to the bottom of this shall we?
Uh yeah.
Um--
Well that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already-
- I ran the utility programs and I had nothing there so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh thank you.
You're welcome.
All right I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go through the entire memory see if something comes up.
Oh my darling Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
You were lost and gone forever
- I love being bathed in the sink.
Dreadful sorry Clementine
- Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier baby Joel.
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh this is-- this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to--
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you Antoine?
Okay we're back in.
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you Mary.
Um Howard you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you Antoine?
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes I know but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What Joel-
- What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please please go.
Please go!
You can run but you can't hide.
Clem come on!
There I am.
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
All right let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember--
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh well at least we know where he is.
He's back on track right?
Come on Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come onyou big baby!
I'm sorry okay?
Let me drive you home.
No!
- Bye Howard.
- No wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh dear.
I'm so sorry Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia-- Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to--
Joel honey I have a surprise-- I just--
Uh you know what honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
Good night sweetheart.
No.
I'm sorry Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel look!
What?
Look where we are!
Clem this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere-- somewhere really buried.
Hit it!
Hit it!
I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Come on you big sissy!
Ooh he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Joel!
Joely get up.
Come on it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth itJoel!
He's not listening!
Come onJoel.
Stupid!
I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live-- lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here look feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One two three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One two three.
You're dead.
Oh my mom.
It's-
- It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo--Joely?
Are you okay Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh my God.
That was terrible.
Okay okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more then I get to go.
Okay.
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No this way.
No this way.
No no no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me Joel!
I like watching you work Howard.
I guess uh--
I guess I'll go out for-- for some air if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah that's uh-- that's fine.
Do you like quotes Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh you know like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational and in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh well I-- I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes
"Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh no.
It's-
- It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander and it goes--
Alexander Pope?
Oh yeah.
Yeah shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
The world forgetting by the world forgot.
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate maybe.
I really admire the work you do Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh it's fine.
It's fine.
I-I-I-I-I-- I'm happy to hear--
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh Mary no.
It's-
- You're a wonderful girl.
But I-
- You know I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh Mary.
Oh Mary we can't do this.
Well good morning Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh my God!
Who is it?
Uh--
Thank you Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait wait wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it Howard.
- Hollis it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You--
You wanted it done... so you could get past uh--
You could-
- Yeah.
Um I have to uh finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to um take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No I'm not married no.
Look man I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life even after that.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay so just tell me what you remember and uh then we'll take it from there.
Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just--
Oh Howie I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best Mary.
Yeah I know.
Oh God.
I'll take the bottom and you-- Uh-uh-uh!
No no no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey the cooler is--
That's light huh?
Oh I can get that.
You can get it.
No no no no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought "Wow how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate eventually.
But at the time I thought "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself and I thought "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
HiJoel.
So no jokes about my name.
You mean like-- Oh my darling oh my darling Oh my darling Clementine
Huckleberry Hound that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
I think your name is magical.
This is it Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Come on man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So uh what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi but we're not really-- I mean--
We're-- Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for um candles matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh God.
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh--
I prefer to be Ruth but I can be flexible.
What are you do--
Alcohol!
Oh boy.
So are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh God I wish I had--
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well I came back downstairs and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like-- It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said "So go"... with such disdain you know?
Oh I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
ByeJoel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
You were operating the plane with the remote control and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on man.
You're stoned and you're driving.
Yeah the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey just watch the road.
I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah man.
Who was that?
She was um just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there I see.
Yeah that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once maybe.
I was coming back from a job and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you and you giggled you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that so I just--
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just--
Where are you Clem?
I'm worried.
I feel like you're mad at me and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.
Listen I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Vamonos senor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible--
- Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic wimpy apologetic smile.
That sort of wounded puppy shit he does you know?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
-Joel I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look let's just take a minute and--
Patrick get the fuck away.
Oh sweetheart-- Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
Hey Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really very educated.
I mean she's smart I think but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes-- I was embarrassed in public...
- Hi.
because she would pronounce...
Library "libary."
- Hi.
Libary.
Li-berry.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still it seduces you.
J- oel I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off okay?
- Hey it's-- it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
- You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
- Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll sooner or later go around fucking everybody.
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know you will think of things and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
{Man On P.A.} Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
{Joel Continues} It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
{Woman Speaking, Faint}

{Joel Continues} Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
{Train Horn Blows}
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
¶¶ Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine ¶¶
¶¶ You were lost and gone forever ¶¶
¶¶ Dreadful sorry Clementine ¶¶¶¶
No?
I'm sorry.
Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...
No, no.
I just...
Sure.
No.
That's okay.
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!

Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
Um...
Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
{Both Laughing}
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
{Slurps Drink}
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could...
Sounds good.
But I...
I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really...
I'm...
I...
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
{Line Ringing}
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
Isn't it?
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh!
Oh, my ass!
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
Come on.
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or...
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um...
Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just...
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.

{Man ¶¶1} We're looking for 159.
{Man ¶¶2} What number's that?
{Man ¶¶1} I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on... {Man ¶¶2} Is that him?
{Man ¶¶1} I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
Hey, Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.

Hey.
Quiet.
{Equipment Dropping Onto Floor}
Hey, Joel.
What's up?
Oh.
Hi, Frank.
{Mailbox Door Opening, Closing} {Keys Jingling}
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
{Man's Voice Echoing, Indistinct}
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh, no!
Yes!
Valentine'sDay is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
- Hi.
-
How are you?
Prettygood.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
Uh-huh.
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too...
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
{Joel Groans}
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
{Dog Barks}
Okay.
What is it?
Idon'tknow.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
{Phone Rings}
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo!
Oh, my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
I assure you, no.
No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
{Dr. Mierzwiak} We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Oww!
Fuck!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you.
{Tires Screech} Wake up, buddy!
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
¶¶¶¶ {Dixieland Jazz}
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
¶¶¶¶
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
{Pencils Clattering On Floor} I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
{Clementine Whooping, Laughing}
There's a good story behind this one...
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
- {Clementine's Voice} That's so...
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
- Next item.
Okay.
- {Electronic Crackling}
{Stan, Voice Electronically Processed} Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
Hey,Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm... {Mierzwiak's Voice, Distant} Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...
underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
{Stan's Voice, Echoing} Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
How'sthat?
Howareyoutoday, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
{Stan's Voice} That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
{Stan's Voice, Electronically Accelerated} "I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."
-
- Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{Door Unlocking, Opening}
{Joel Whispering} This is the last time I saw you.
{Joel Clears Throat, Sighs}
{Heavy Sigh}
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh,God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just...
I was just...
I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
{Door Slams} Clem?
{Computer Beeps} Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have... {Clicks Tongue} Yeah.
{Keyboard Typing}
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is...
is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be...
{Engine Starts}
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
{Engine Knocking}
Istheresomethingwrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's... funny.
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
Right.
Yeah.
{Stan Chuckling} Was.
We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
What?
You little fuck...
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
They were clean!
What?
D-Don't!
Stop!
Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
Wegotworktodo.
{Computer Beeps} Give me my papers.
There's, um...
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
You what?
Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical...
It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
{Stan Continues, Echoing} Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
{High-pitched Giggling}
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
{Voice Wavering, Electronically Altered} I don't see anyone.
{Clock Ticking}
{TV:
Man Talking, Audience Laugh Track} Joel?
Where are my boots?
{TV:
Man} Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
{Laugh Track Continues}
{TV:
Grandpa Munster} Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
{TV:
Grandpa Munster} First thing to do is...
sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God...
Mmm!
{Voice Echoing} It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
{Voice Fading, Echoing} Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion... {Doorbell Rings}
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
Find us okay?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
{Typing On Keyboard} {Patrick Whispering} Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
{Mock Whispering} {Stan Laughing}
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
{Patrick Laughing} Mmm!
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
{Mary Laughs} God!
{Patrick Laughing} Can you wake him up?
{Patrick Laughing} You can't wake him up.
{Patrick Continues Laughing} {Stan Yells}
Mmm.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
{Joel's Voice} November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
{Joel's Voice} She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
{Phone Beep Dialing}
{Line Ringing} Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
Hey, Tangerine.
{Clementine On Phone} Oh, Patrick, it's you.
I'm so miserable right now.
Why?
What's wrong?
Idon'tknow.
{Voice Electronically Altered} Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you find something, sir?
Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
{Voice Electronically Altered} Baby, come here.
Scared of what?
Do you love me?
OfcourseIdo.
Where's the self-help section?
{Clementine Sobbing} Do you think I'm ugly?
No!
You're beautiful!
{Dishes Rattle}
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.
I don't know.
I
- I'm a mess, Patrick.
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm!
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
{Punches Keys}
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
¶¶¶¶
{Answering Machine:
Joel} Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
{Patrick On Answering Machine} Pick up!
Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
¶¶¶¶
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
{Continues Giggling}
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
What?
thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It...
It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
{Joel's Voice} Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
{Clementine Whoops} Stop it!
{Clementine Laughing}
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
{Stereo:
Man} ¶¶ When you ain't got nothing to do ¶¶
¶¶ I think I'll marry you ¶¶¶¶
Is anybody there?
{Loud Groaning}
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement...
Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then...
What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why...
No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
{Dog Barking}
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
{Door Closes} I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
{Dog Barks}
I'm here!
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
{Mary Laughs} Don't!
That tickles me!
Oh,mygoodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You...
You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.

Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen,I 'mjustgonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
{Woman ¶¶2} Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
Wow!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
{Angry Grunt} Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's...
There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
{Phone Rings}
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
{Bottles Clinking}
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary...
Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just...
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You...
You're kind,
beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
{Doorbell Ringing}
{Clears Throat}
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
{Clears Throat}
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already...
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
¶¶ Oh, my darling Oh, my darling ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, my darling Clementine ¶¶
¶¶ You were lost and gone forever ¶¶ I love being bathed in the sink.
¶¶ Dreadful sorry, Clementine ¶¶¶¶ Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh, this is...
this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
{Gasps, Panting}
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
{Kissing Sounds} {Kissing Sounds}
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel...
What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
{Tires Screech}
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
{Distorted Voice} All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
{Stan's Voice} He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!
{Joel's Voice} I'm sorry, okay?
{Angry Voices Overlapping}
{Joel's Voice} Let me drive you home.
{Child Yells}
No!
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just...
Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
{Wheezing Laugh} Good night, sweetheart.
{Laughing Continues} No.
I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.
{Children Shouting}
Hit it!
Hit it!
I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
{Shouting Continues}
Come on, you big sissy!
{Shouting Stops}
Ooh!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!
{Joel's Voice} I'm so ashamed.
{Clementine's Voice} It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live...
lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
{Both Groaning}
Oh, my mom.
It's...
It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
{Muffled Grunting}
Jo...
Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
{Clementine Giggling}
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work, Howard.
I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh... that's fine.
{Door Closes} Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's...
It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I
- I
- I
- I
- I...
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's...
You're a wonderful girl.
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
{Engine Starts}
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You could...
Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
{Mary Crying} Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
¶¶ Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine ¶¶
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
We're...
Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
{Tapping Phone Receiver Button}
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
{Wind Howling} I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
{Joel's Voice} I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
{Joel's Voice} I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
Ididn'tcrashthe plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
Youwereoperatingthe plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey, just watch the road.
Ican'tseeshit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
{Line Ringing}
{Ringing Continues}
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
{Horn Honks}
{Van Door Closes, Engine Starts}
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
{Sighs, Clears Throat} Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
{Man On P.A., Indistinct}
Aah!
{Man On P.A.} Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just...
{Patrick On Tape} Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
{Mary's Voice} To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
{Mary's Voice Overlapping} I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
{On Tape} My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...
{Exasperated Sigh}
{Door Closes}
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
{Sets Brake}
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{Joel On Tape} Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
because she would pronounce... library "libary." Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
{On Tape} I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
{On Tape} I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
{Quiet Sob}
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Montauk train on track "B."
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
Last call... to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
No?
I'm sorry.
Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...
No, no.
I just...
Sure.
No.
That's okay.
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
Hi.
I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
Um...
Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could...
Sounds good.
But I...
I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really...
I'm...
I...
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
Isn't it?
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh!
Oh, my ass!
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
Come on.
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or...
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um...
Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just...
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.
We're looking for 159.
What number's that?
I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...
Is that him?
I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
Hey, Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.
Patrick, stop it.
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Whew.
Okay.
Showtime at the Apollo.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey.
Quiet.
Hey, Joel.
What's up?
Oh.
Hi, Frank.
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh, no!
Yes!
Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
Hi.
How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
Uh-huh.
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too...
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
Okay.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo!
Oh, my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
I assure you, no.
No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Oww!
Fuck!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you.
Wake up, buddy!
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
There's a good story behind this one...
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
- That's so...
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
Next item.
Okay.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm...
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
How's that?
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."
Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just...
I was just...
I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
Clem?
Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...
Yeah.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is...
is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be...
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's... funny.
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
Right.
Yeah.
Was.
We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
What?
You little fuck...
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
They were clean!
What?
D-Don't!
Stop!
Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
We got work to do.
Give me my papers.
There's, um...
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
You what?
Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical...
It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel?
Where are my boots?
Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
First thing to do is... sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God...
Mmm!
It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
Find us okay?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
Mmm!
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
God!
Can you wake him up?
You can't wake him up.
Mmm.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
Hey, Tangerine.
Oh, Patrick, it's you.
I'm so miserable right now.
Why?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you find something, sir?
Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
Baby, come here.
Scared of what?
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
Do you think I'm ugly?
No!
You're beautiful!
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.
I don't know.
I
- I'm a mess, Patrick.
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm!
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up!
Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
What?
thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It...
It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
Is anybody there?
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement...
Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then...
What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why...
No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
Don't!
That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You...
You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.
It's working!
I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
Wow!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's...
There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary...
Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just...
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You...
You're kind, beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already...
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
I love being bathed in the sink.
Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh, this is...
this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel...
What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!
I'm sorry, okay?
Let me drive you home.
No!
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just...
Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
Good night, sweetheart.
No.
I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.
Hit it!
Hit it!
I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Come on, you big sissy!
Ooh!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!
I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live...
lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
Oh, my mom.
It's...
It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo...
Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work, Howard.
I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh... that's fine.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's...
It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I
- I
- I
- I
- I...
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's...
You're a wonderful girl.
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You could...
Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
We're...
Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
Aah!
Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just...
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
because she would pronounce... library "libary." Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Took a train out to Montauk.
[ Man On P.A.] Montauk train boarding on track "B. "
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
[ Panting ]
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
[Joel Continues ] It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant,Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
[ Woman Speaking, Faint ]

[Joel Continues ] Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
[ Train Horn Blows ]
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red-
- Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just-- I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
[ Inhaling ]
[ Sniffs ]
[ Sighs ]
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi,Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
[ Chuckles ]
- Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine -
- You were lost and gone forever -
- Dreadful sorry Clementine --
[ Laughing ] No?
I'm sorry.Just-- It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh-- It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just--
I don't know.
I just, uh--
You seem nice, so--
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
[ Clementine ] Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
[ Exhales ]
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
[ Giggles ]
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh--
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing, and--
No, no.

It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um--
Um--
[ Chuckles ] Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night,Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
[ Laughs ] Come on.
[ Exhales ]
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
[ Whispers ] I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
[ Both Laughing ]
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
[ Slurps Drink ]
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could--
Sounds good.
But I-
- I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really-
- I'm-
- I--
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
[ Beeping ]
[ Line Ringing ]
[ Clementine ] What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
[ Laughs ]
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
[ Laughs ] I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
[ Sighs ] Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
[ Clementine ] Isn't it?
[ Sighs ]
[ Giggling ] Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh.!
Oh, my ass.!
[ Grunts ]
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on.!
What if it breaks?
- "What if'?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
[ Whispers ] Come on.
[ Mutters ]
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!
[ Chuckles ]
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
[ Sighs ] Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
[ Laughing ] It's not gonna crack or break or--
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um-
- Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
[ Laughs ]
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
[ Laughing ] Shut the fuck up!
[ Whispers ] Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
[ Sighs ] Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just--
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
[ Sniffles ]
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.

[ Man #1 ] We're looking for 1 59.
[ Man #2 ] What number's that?
[ Man #1 ] I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ,you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on--
[ Man #2 ] Is that him?
[ Man #1 ] I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
[ Giggling ]
Hey,Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
[ Chuckling ]
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.
- -[Man#1 Singing,Falsetto] [ Man #2 ] Patrick, stop it.
[ Sighs ]
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Whew.
Okay.
[ Man #1 ] Showtime at the Apollo.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey.
[ Whispers ] Quiet.
[ Grunting ]
[ Equipment Dropping Onto Floor ]
[ Frank ] Hey,Joel.
What's up?
[Joel ] Oh.
Hi, Frank.
[ Mailbox Door Opening, Closing ] [ Keys Jingling ]
[ Sighs ] I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
[ Man's Voice Echoing, Indistinct ]
You're lucky you have Clementine,Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
[ Whispers ] No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
[ Chuckling ] [ Woman ] Oh, no.!
[Joel ] Yes.!
Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away.!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
[Joel ] So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and--
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
[ Chuckles ]
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
[ Patrick ] Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
-[ Patrick ] Hi.
-[ Kiss ]
How are you?
[ Clementine ] Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
[ Patrick ] Uh-huh.
[ Clementine ] I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
[ Panting ]
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No.!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too--
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
[Joel Groans ]
All right,Joel, look, man, seriously.
[ Woman ] Rob.!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's aboutJoel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you--
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
[ Dog Barks ]
Okay.
What is it?
[ Rob ] I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
[ Woman ] Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in--
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr.--
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- [ Mutters ] Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
[ Phone Rings ]
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh,yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo.!
Oh, my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just-- I'm working!
[ Mutters ] Sorry.
Sorry.
[ Whispers ] Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem--
I assure you, no.
[ Woman ] No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
[ Dr. Mierzwiak ] We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
[ Banging ]
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
[ Rob ] Oww.!
Fuck.!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say,Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
[ Sighs ]
A lark.
[ Sobbing ] Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
[ Woman ] Wait, wait, wait, wait.!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's-- that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh-- to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh-- the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home--
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened-- a new life awaiting you.
[ Tires Screech ] [ Driver] Wake up, buddy!
[ Mary ] No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy-- How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can-- We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a-and he--
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 1 2.:1 5?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Knocks ]
- -[DixielandJazz]
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
-- [ Continues ]
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach-- I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
[ Pencils Clattering On Floor ] I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
[ Mierzwiak ] Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
[ Clementine Whooping, Laughing ]
There's a good story behind this one--
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
[ Stan ] Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
-[ Clementine's Voice ] That's so--
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
[ Chuckles ]
- Next item.
Okay.
- [ Electronic Crackling ]
[ Stan, Voice Electronically Processed ] Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
[ Stan ] Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
[ Patrick ] Yeah.
[ Stan ] Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm-- [ Scoffs ]
[ Mierzwiak's Voice, Distant ] Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh-- Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I--
Why am I-- I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and--
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so--
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...
[ Simultaneously ] underway tonight, we have some work to do.
[ Whispering ] I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it-- This is what it would look like.
Very good.
[ Simultaneously ] We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
[ Stan ] Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
[ Stan's Voice, Echoing ] Patrick, can you check-- Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- [ Stan ] A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
-[ Stan ] Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
[ Patrick ] How's that?
[ Mary ] How are you today, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
[ Stan's Voice ] That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.Journal. That would be invaluable.
[ Stan's Voice, Electronically Accelerated ] "I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing. "
- [ Screaming ]
- Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
[ Beeps ] That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
[ Sighs ]
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
[ Whispers ] Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can wejust please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[ Door Unlocking, Opening ]
[Joel Whispering ] This is the last time I saw you.
[Joel Clears Throat, Sighs ]
[ Heavy Sigh ]
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
[ Sighs ] Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
[ Sighs ] Oh, God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ.!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent,Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
[ Laughing ] Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it,Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
[ Sighs ] I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just-
- I was just-- [ Sighs ] I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
[ Door Slams ] Clem?
[ Computer Beeps ] [ Stan ] Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
[ Patrick ] Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
[ Patrick ] I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have--
[ Clicks Tongue ] Yeah.
[ Keyboard Typing ]
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is-- is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
[ Laughs ]
You gotta be--
[ Engine Starts ]
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot.!
Look at it out here.!
It's all falling apart.!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
[ Engine Knocking ]
[ Patrick ] Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
[ Stan ] No, I think it's... funny.
[ Patrick ] So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
[ Stan ] Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
[ Patrick ] Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
[ Stan ] That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
[ Patrick ] Right.
[ Stan ] Yeah.
[ Stan Chuckling ] Was.
We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
[ Laughing ] What?
You little fuck--
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like--
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
[ Patrick ] They were clean.!
[ Stan ] What?
D-Don't.!
Stop.!
[ Patrick ] Okay.
Yeah.!
All right.!
[ Stan ] We got work to do.
[ Computer Beeps ] [ Stan ] Give me my papers.
[ Crunching ]
[ Slurps ]
[ Patrick ] There's, um-- [ Sighs ]
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
[ Stan ] You what?
[ Mutters ] Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick.!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical--
[ Laughing ] It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
[ Stan Continues, Echoing ] Patrick,you stole a girl's panties.!
[ High-pitched Giggling ]
[ Laughing ]
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
[ Voice Wavering, Electronically Altered ] I don't see anyone.

[ TV.:
Man Talking, Audience Laugh Track ] [ Clementine ]Joel?
Where are my boots?
[ TV.:
Man ] Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
[ Laugh Track Continues ]
[ TV.:
Grandpa Munster ] Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
[ TV.:
Grandpa Munster ] First thing to do is--
[ Chuckles ] sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
[ Chuckles ] Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
[ Scoffs ] What?
[ Mutters ] I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
[ Whispering ] I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to--
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
[ Whispering ] I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God-
- Mmm!
[ Voice Echoing ] It's you,Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
[ Voice Fading, Echoing ] Maybe I should end this right here,Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion--
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey,you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
[ Stan ] Find us okay?
[ Mary ] Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
[ Typing On Keyboard ] [ Patrick Whispering ] Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
[ Mock Whispering ] [ Stan Laughing ]
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
[ Clink ]
[ Laughing ] Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
[ Patrick Laughing ] Mmm!
[ Groans ]
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
[ Crash ] [ Mary Laughs ] God.!
[ Patrick Laughing ] Can you wake him up?
[ Patrick Laughing ] You can't wake him up.
[ Patrick Continues Laughing ] [ Stan Yells ]
Mmm.
[ Moans ]
You don't tell me things,Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things,Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just-- really just isn't that interesting.
[ Clementine ] I wanna read some of thosejournals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
[Joel's Voice ] November 1 9, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
[ Whispers ] I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
[Joel's Voice ] She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just--
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
[ Phone Beep Dialing ]
[ Line Ringing ] [ Stan ] Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
[ Patrick ] Hey, Tangerine.
[ Clementine On Phone ] Oh, Patrick, it's you.
[ Sighs ] I'm so miserable right now.
[ Patrick ] Why?
What's wrong?
[ Clementine ] I don't know.
[ Voice Electronically Altered ] Excuse me?
I'm so confused.!
Can I help you find something, sir?
[ Patrick ] Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
[ Voice Electronically Altered ] Baby, come here.
[ Patrick ] Scared of what?
[ Clementine ] Do you love me?
[ Patrick ] Of course I do.
[ Whispers ] Where's the self-help section?
[ Clementine Sobbing ] Do you think I'm ugly?
[ Patrick ] No.!
You're beautiful.!
[ Dishes Rattle ]
Maybe I should come over.
[ Clementine ] No, no.
I don't know.
I-I'm a mess, Patrick.
[ Patrick ] Well,just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
[ Clementine ] Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's--
[ Garbled ] Let him go, Stan!
[ Garbled ] Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
[ Laughing ] Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm!
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
[ Mary ] This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash-- the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice-- Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
[ Beeping ]
To let people begin again.
[ Punches Keys ]
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
.
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

[ Answering Machine.:
Joel ] Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
[ Beeps ]
[ Patrick On Answering Machine ] Pick up.!
Pick up, man.!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[ Laughing ]
- -[Continues]
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
[ Continues Giggling ]
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
[ Muttering ] Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want--"
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too.!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh--
I got you this...
What?
thing, um--
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It-
- It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
[ Sighs ] Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her.:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her, [ Sniffles ]
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
[Joel's Voice ] Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
[ Clementine ] I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
[ Clementine Whoops ] Stop it!
[ Clementine Laughing ]
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
.
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
.
[ Stereo.:
Man ] Whenyouain 'tgot nothingtodo
I thinkI'llmarryyou- ---
[ Screaming ] Is anybody there?
[ Loud Groaning ]
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement-- Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the offiice.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
[ Clementine ] Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
[ Mierzwiak ] Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffiice it to say that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
[Joel ] Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then-- What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why-
- No, I don't want to-- Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
[ Dog Barking ]
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
[Joel ] Mierzwiak.!
Wake me up.!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her--
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too,Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
[ Grunts ] Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh,Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
[ Door Closes ] I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
[ Grunting ]
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
[ Dog Barks ]
I'm here!
[ Screams ]
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
[ Laughing ]
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
[ Mary Laughs ] Don't.!
That tickles me.!
[ Stan ] Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ.!
What the--
[ Mary ] It's a birthmark.!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn't-- I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one ofJoel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually--
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You-
- You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
[ Beeping ] [ Clementine ] Joel?
[Joel ] Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
[ Sighs ] Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
[ Scoffs ] Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.

Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
[ Woman ] Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
[ Woman #2 ] Sure.
Hejust likes to be near me.
Absolutely.!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this.!
Wow.!
It worked.!
Look.!
Look at this dress, man.!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
[ Laughing ]
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, babyJoel.
Hey,Joely.!
Joely.!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5.:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
[ Grunting ] Uh,Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after,you know, you've had your dinner.
[ Angry Grunt ] Come on,Joel.!
Joel, grow up.!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
[ Sobbing ]
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
[ Crying ] I want my mommy!
Don't cry, babyJoel.
BabyJoel, it's okay.
Joel.Joely.Joel!
Stop it.!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden,Joel.
Look.!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
[ Buzzing ]
[ Buzzing ] It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look,you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
All gooey and-- and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit.!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh.!
Oh.!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my-- I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's-
- There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around.!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
[ Phone Rings ]
[ Rings ]
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't-- I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh--
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
[ Stan ] I'm at 1 59 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
[ Bottles Clinking ]
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary-
- Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary,you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes-- I look like shit!
Joely, stop it.!
Joel.!
Look.!
Hey,Joel.!
[ Blubbering ]
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just-
- Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy-- he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You-
- You're kind,
[ Sobbing ] beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
[ Groans ]
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
[ Chuckles ] [ Doorbell Ringing ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um--
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
[ Clears Throat ]
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already-
- I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
- Oh, my darling Oh, my darling -
- Oh, my darling Clementine -
- You were lost and gone forever - I love being bathed in the sink.
- Dreadful sorry, Clementine -- Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, babyJoel.
[ Giggling ] Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
[ Grunts ]
[ Gagging ]
[ Coughing ]
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
-[ Stan ] No.
Oh, this is-- this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to--
I'm gonna have to give him this.
[ Gasps, Panting ]
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
[ Mierzwiak ] Okay, we're back in.
[ Mary ] Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
[ Kissing Sounds ] [ Kissing Sounds ]
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh.!
Oh.!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
[ Giggling ]
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
[ Crying ] What,Joel-
- What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
[ Tires Screech ]
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
[ Distorted Voice ] All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember--
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
[ Sighs ] Come on, Clem.
[ Stan's Voice ] He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
[ Boy ] Come on,you big baby.!
[Joel's Voice ] I'm sorry, okay?
[ Angry Voices Overlapping ]
[Joel's Voice ] Let me drive you home.
[ Child Yells ]
No!
-[ Mary ] Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
[ Mary ] I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia-- Joel.
[ Sighs ] I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to--
Joel, honey, I have a surprise-- I just-
- Oh, um--
Uh,you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
[ Wheezing Laugh ] Good night, sweetheart.
[ Laughing Continues ] No.
I'm sorry,Joel.Joely. Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere-- somewhere really buried.
[ Children Shouting ]
Hit it!
Hit it!
[Joel ] I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later.!
[ Shouting Continues ]
Come on, you big sissy!
[ Shouting Stops ]
[ Sobbing ]
[ Children ] Ooh.!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend.!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her.!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
[ Groaning ] Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it,Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
Come on,Joel.
Stupid!
[Joel's Voice ] I'm so ashamed.
[ Clementine's Voice ] It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live--lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
[ Both Groaning ]
Oh, my mom.
It's-
- It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi,Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead.!
[ Grunts ]
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem.!
[ Gasps ]
Clem!
[ Grunting ]
[ Muffled Grunting ]
[ Groans ]
[ Growling ]
Jo--Joely?
Are you okay,Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
[ Clementine Giggling ]
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
[ Shouts ]
What's wrong with you?
[ Laughing ]
Let go of me,Joel!
[ Grunts ]
I like watching you work, Howard.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Grunts ] I guess, uh--
I guess I'll go out for-- for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh-- that's fine.
[ Door Closes ] Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh,you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I-- I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's-
- It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes--
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned. "
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I-I-I-I-I-- I'm happy to hear--
[ Sighs ] I'm sorry.
[ Sighing ]
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's-
- You're a wonderful girl.
But I-
- You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
[ Honking ]
[ Mary ] What?
Oh, my God.!
Who is it?
[ Sighs ]
Uh--
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
[ Engine Starts ]
Hollis.!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush.!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You--
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh--
You could-
- Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
[ Stan ] Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
[ Mierzwiak ] Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
[ Mary ] Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and...just--
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
[ Mierzwiak ] We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
[ Mary Crying ] Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you-- Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is--
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
[Joel ] This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I couldjust make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back. "
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi,Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like--
- Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine -
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it,Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
[ Clementine ] You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
[ Giggling ] There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo.!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really-- I mean--
We're-- [ Laughing ] Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
[ Tapping Phone Receiver Button ]
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
[ Sighs ]
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh--
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do-- [ Chuckling ]
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
[ Wind Howling ] I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
[Joel's Voice ] I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
[ Clementine ] I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had--
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like-- It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
[Joel's Voice ] I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
[ Clementine ] Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye,Joel.
[Joel ] I love you.
[ Whispering ] Meet me in Montauk.
[ Rob ] I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
[ Carrie ] You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
[ Rob ] It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
[ Carrie ] You're stoned, and you're driving.
[ Rob ] Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
[ Carrie ] Honey,just watch the road.
[ Rob ] I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um,just a girl.
[ Beep ]
Okay.
[ Groans ]
[ Line Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
[ Horn Honks ]
[ Van Door Closes, Engine Starts ]
[ Groaning ]
[ Sighs ]
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
[ Sighs, Clears Throat ] Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just--
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
[ Man On P.A., Indistinct ]
Aah!
[ Man On P.A.] Montauk train now boarding on track "B. "All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.Just--
[ Beeps ]
[ Patrick On Tape ] Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
[ Chuckles ]
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
[ Mary's Voice ] To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
[ Mary's Voice Overlapping ] I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible-- Some kind of teaser ad or something.
[ Mary ] In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
[ On Tape ] My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to eraseJoel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does,you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
-Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and--
[ Exasperated Sigh ]
[ Door Closes ]
[ Panting ]
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart-- Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
[ Sobbing ]
[ Sets Brake ]
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Joel On Tape ] Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books,you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes-- I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
because she would pronounce... library "libary. " Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
[ On Tape ] I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's--it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
[ On Tape ] I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.Just wait.
What do you want,Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
[ Quiet Sob ]
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept,Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
[ Crying ]
Okay.
Okay.
[ Laughing ]

Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies... to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
I don't know why.
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are some what diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see who shows me the least bit of attention?
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
- Really?
- What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
- Sure.
Sure.
- That's it!
- Yeah?
- I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
- Ah.
- Jesus!
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
- Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
- What might?
- It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
- It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
- Right.
Yeah.
- Snappy name, huh?
- I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
- My name's Clementine, by the way.
- I'm Joel.
- Hi, Joel.
- Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
- Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
- It's been suggested.
# Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine #
# You were lost and gone forever Dreadful sorry Clementine #
No?
I'm sorry.
Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful".
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I...
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Why wouldn't you think that about me?
- I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice".
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is, I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but... right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
- Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
- I...
I'm writing, and...
- No, no.
I just...
- Sure.
No.
That's okay.
- I just have...
You know, this is...
- Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
Hi.
I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
It is frosty.
- You're not a stalker or anything, right?
- I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
- I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
- Um...
Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
- I'm embarrassed now.
- No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal, just...
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, you know?
taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
- I think about that.
- Yeah?
You're really nice.
- Ohh!
- God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
- And, um, we could...
- Sounds good.
But I...
I should, uh, go.
Now.
- You should stay.
- No, I really...
I'm...
I...
- I have to get up so early.
- I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
- Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
- Oh!
You said "I do".
I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
Isn't it?
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh!
Oh, my ass!
- I think I should go back.
- Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
Come on.
- Ohh.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
- Whoa!
- This is good.
- Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um...
Oh.
I don't... know any.
- Show me which ones you know.
- Okay... okay!
Oh...
Here's Osidius.
- Where?
- Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
- You're full of shit.
Right?
- Nope.
- Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
- Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.
Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
- Let me get my toothbrush.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Just...
Yes?
- Can I help you?
- What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.

- We're looking for 159.
- What number's that?
I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...
- ...is that him?
- I think so.
Ok, that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
- Hey, Joel.
- Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
McRomance!
- You want some fries with that shake?
- I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.
Patrick, stop it.
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Whew.
Okay.
Showtime at the Apollo.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey.
Quiet.
Get it off your head.
Hey, Joel.
What's up?
Oh.
Hi, Frank.
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh, no!
Yes!
You know Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought, you know, I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
- What you doing here, baby?
- Just came to surprise you.
- Let me know if you need something, sir.
- You look good.
- How are you?
- Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
- I so want what's in your suit.
- Oh, good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
- I know, honey.
- For being honest.
It's horrible.
- I should just go to her house.
- No!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too...
- Right.
- Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
- Rob!
- Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
O, you're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
Okay.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
- I'm Joel Barish.
- Excuse me?
I'm Joel...
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
- Here.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
- You still need to fill the form out, sir.
- Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
- Good morning.
Lacuna.
- Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
- Boo!
- Oh, my God!
Stan!
- Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
- I'm working!
Sorry.
Sorry.
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
- This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
- I assure you, no.
No.
- Mm-mmm.
- There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on."
"We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Fuck!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
- It's okay.
It's all right.
- Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Don't.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day...
- ...is our busy time.
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh... to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take...
- ...care of Mrs. Woo.
- Yes, of course.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you.
Wake up, buddy!
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency and we'll do everything we can... we can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
- Mr. Barish.
- Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
- There's a good story behind this one...
- Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just please try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
- That's so...
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
Next item.
Okay.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
- Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
- Yeah.
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
- Uh, voltage looks fine.
- Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm...
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.
- Patrick?
- Yeah?
- Patrick, can you check...
- Patrick?
- ...
I'm getting some sort of readout of...
- Patrick?
- ...my own voice.
- Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
- How's that?
- How are you today, Mr. Barish?
- There we are, Mr. Barish.
- That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do."
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing." I don't know...
Whoa!
Jesus!
- Come on!
come on!
Careful!
Step back!
- What?
What?
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
- This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
- It's an apartment, Patrick.
Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Come on.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
- Don't call me pathetic.
- Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
- Oh, God.
- I don't know!
maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
- Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
- Oh, Christ!
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
- A wino?
- A wino?
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
- Clem?
- Your keys.
- I was just...
- I won't need them anymore.
I was just...
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
Clem?
Mary's coming over tonight.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
So, maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
- Do whatever you want.
- Did I tell you I have...
Yeah.
- Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
- We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is... is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be...
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's... funny.
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Was.
We took care of that.
- Oh, God!
- Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
- What?
You little fuck...
- What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
- Jesus!
- What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
- They were clean!
- What?
D...
Don't!
Stop!
- Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
- We got work to do.
Give me my papers.
There's, um...
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
You what?
- Jesus.
- Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea...
- how unethical...
- It's not really that bad we were.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel?
Where are my boots?
Now why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions", I said.
Potions.
- Love potion, please.
- I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
First thing to do is... sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
- I don't wanna talk about this!
- Fucking ventriloquist!
- We're fucking gonna talk about it!
- I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
- I'm sorry, Clem.
- I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart...
- ...and I'd make a fucking great mother!
- Oh, God...
Mmm!
It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
- It's going!
It's going!
- You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
- Leave you at the flea market with this...
- It's done.
This is crap.
...stupid costume jewelry!
- Maybe you could find yourself an antique...
- All the pain,
- ...rocking chair to die in!
- confusion...
- Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
- Hey, you.
- Oh, it's freezing outside.
- Find us okay?
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
- Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
- Patrick?
- Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
Stan...
Stan.
- There's more.
- No!
- Yes.
- No!
Hey, hey!
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
- Uh, no, that's okay.
- Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh... oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Mmm!
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
God!
Can you wake him up?
You can't wake him up.
Mmm.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
- People have to share things, Joel.
- Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry...
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... if you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
- How's the chicken?
- Good.
- More?
- No.
No.
Thank you.
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
- Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
- It's really...
- Gross.
- Gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
Hey, Tangerine.
Eh, oh, Patrick, it's you.
I'm so miserable right now.
- Why?
What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I'm just...
Can I help you find something, sir?
Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
Baby, come here.
Scared of what?
- Do you love me?
- Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
- Do you think I'm ugly?
- No!
You're beautiful!
- Maybe I should come over.
- No, no.
I don't know.
I...
I'm a mess, Patrick.
- you know...
- Well!
Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
Patrick!
We're right in the middle...
- of erasing this poor man's...
- Let him go, Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
- See?
- How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
- Oh, oh, oh, ooooh, man!
- I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
- I like it.
- You do?
- You look like a tangerine.
- Ohh!
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
- Mmm!
Juicy!
- And seedless.
- I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
- Tangerine.
- Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
- How does he know to call you that?
- How did who know?
- Oh, my God.
- This is pretty cool.
Clem?
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash... the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Like social justice...
- Yeah, it's totally incredible.
- What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
And Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
- Baby, what's going on?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared, I feel like I'm disappearing.
- Disappearing?
- My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
- Nothing makes any sense to me!
- You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
- Nothing makes any sense.
- Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
- Montauk?
- Yeah.
- No!
Come up to Boston with me.
- Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up!
Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
- Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
- Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
- I'm so excited.
Yea.
- I'm excited too!
- Cool.
- Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
- What?
- thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It...
It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter. so...
I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
- You're pretty.
- Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Whoo!
- Whoa!
- Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
Is anybody there?
- Clementine?
- Joel?
- Clement...
- Joely?
- Clem!
- Joel?
Clem!
- What?
- We gotta go.
We gotta go.
- What?
Where?
- I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
- Joely.
- Come on, Clem.
- No!
- Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
- Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
- Smell my pits!
No.
- Good.
- Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
- Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
- Just tell me everything you remember.
- That's what he said.
Then...
- What did we see that day?
- No, wait.
- Oh, look!
Hey!
- Shit!
- We're going to see my grandma.
- Joel, why...
- No, I don't want to...
- Joel, please!
- We're not going on a train.
- Don't make me run anymore.
- Come on!
Mierzwiak!
- Do we always have to run?
- Mierzwiak!
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I...
I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
- Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
- Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
- Don't!
That tickles me!
- Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second,
- but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
- See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong...
- ... than to actually...
- Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
- Then what?
I'm listening.
- I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
- I'm sorry.
- You...
You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
- Mm-hmm?
- I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
- What?
- Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
- Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
- Okay.
# Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream #
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily #
# Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream #
- # Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily # - # Life is but a dream #
It's working!
I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye...
- ...on Joel?
- Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
- Absolutely!
- Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
Wow!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
- Mrs. Hamlyn.
- Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
- Thank you so much.
- She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
- Hey, Joely!
Joely!
- Is every little peanut under there...
- ...okay?
- Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
- I would die for a vodka.
- Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the...
- ...table.
- Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
- This is sort of warped.
- I'm scared.
- I want my mommy!
- Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
- What?
- It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
- He's off the map.
He's off the map.
- Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
- What shall we do?
- I don't know what to do.
- What shall we do?
- Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all...
- ...half-baked.
- Okay.
- Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
- All gooey and...
- ...half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
- Okay.
- Oh, shit!
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
- I can't call Howard.
- He's an unbaked cookie.
He's...
There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
- What are you talking about?
- Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
- Hello.
- Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
- W...
Where's Patrick?
- Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
- Okay, what's the address?
- I know.
I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.
Come on.
- I'm at 159 South Village.
- Yeah.
- Apartment 1E.
Rockville Center.
- Mary?
- Yeah?
- He's coming right now.
I'm staying.
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
- I think you should go.
- Hell, no.
Mary...
Shit.
- I am so stoned.
- Please, Mary.
- You have to go.
- Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if...
- ...
Howard comes
- I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
- Joel!
- I want her to pick me up.
- It's weird how strong that desire is.
- Joel, Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, ...
- ...and we'll start over.
- Pat?
I just...
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
- That Patrick guy... he's copying me.
- What Patrick guy?
- That guy!
- What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now... he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You...
You're kind, beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
- Move, move, move!
Careful, careful.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
Cool.
- Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
- Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues, you know.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
- Well, that's odd.
- I already tried that.
- Did you try going through the C-gate?
- Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
- You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.
All right.
I already...
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
- Here, Howard.
- Okay.
- I got you a chair.
- Oh, thank you.
- There you go.
- You're welcome.
All right.
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
I love being bathed in the sink.
Such a feeling of security.
- I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
- Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh, this is... this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I...
I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
- My name is Wally.
- Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
- Hey.
- My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
- What, Joel...
What are you doing?
- We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
- Come on, Clem.
- He seems to have developed some sort of resistance...
- ...to the procedure.
- I don't want to run anymore.
Shit...
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.
- Humiliation.
- Come on, you big baby!
I'm sorry, okay?
Let me drive you home.
No!
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
- Oh, dear.
- I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
- Hu-mi-lia...
- Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just...
Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
Good night, sweetheart.
No.
- I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
- Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
- Joel, look!
- What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.
- Hit it!
Hit it!
- I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Ooh!
- Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
- Wait.
What am I doing?
- You know something, Freddy?
- And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
Joel!
- Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
- Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
- Come on, Joel.
- Stupid!
- I'm so ashamed.
- It's okay.
- You were a little kid.
- Yeah?
- Come on.
- That's where I live...
lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
- It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
- I can?
You're really gonna die though.
- Okay.
- One, two, three.
You're dead.
Oh, my mom.
It's...
It's okay.
We're playing.
- Hi, Joel's mom.
- It's not real.
- He's killing me.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo...
Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
- Okay, okay.
- That was like three seconds.
- All right.
Let me do it one more time.
- One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoo!
- Look at this.
- This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
- Shit!
- It's fluff.
Our house!
- Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
- Come on.
- Come on.
We gotta go!
- Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
- No!
- This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
- I don't even know where we're going.
- It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
- It's the best place.
No, this way.
- No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way, come on.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work, Howard.
Uh,...
I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh... that's fine.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
- What do you mean?
- Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
- Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
- There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
- That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's...
It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander and it goes...
- Alexander Pope?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,
- and then I go ahead and say it.
- It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot?"
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot."
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind."
"Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
- I don't mean to be so familiar.
- Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Oh, Mary, no.
It's...
You're a wonderful girl.
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and ki...
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
- Oh, my God!
- Who is it?
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
- Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y...
You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You cou...
Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We...
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so...
I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or...
I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.
- I had you pegged, didn't I?
- You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,
- and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
- Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of... us being married and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
- I'll take the bottom and you...
- Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
- I can take that.
- So you want me to carry that?
- I will do that.
- Okay.
- Can you get the cooler?
- Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
- You can get it.
Get it?
- Oh, I can get that.
- Take your time.
- No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
Just...
- I can take the plane.
- Put...
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!"
- "An orange sweatshirt."
- Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you... sitting over here... by yourself,
and I thought, "Thank God."
"Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I... borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
# Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine. #
# Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
#
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
- You married?
- No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of...
live with someone though.
- Male or female?
- What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
- You know these people?
- No, of course not.
Come on.
- They might have a dog.
- There's no dog.
What are you doing?
- It's freezing out.
- I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh... what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
- We're...
- Whatever.
So, this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches...
- and the liquor cabinet.
- Oh, my God.
- I think we should go.
- There's no phone line.
What?
- I think we should go.
- Why?
It's our house... just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin".
- Which one do you want to be?
- Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
Alcohol!
- Oh, boy.
- So, are you okay with wine?
- I don't know.
- Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- I really should go.
I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
- Was it something I said?
- Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
- Honey, just watch the road.
- I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
- She was nice.
- Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
Hey!
Hey.
- You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
- Yeah, that's right...
- ...my stuff.
- I take it you're not coming back.
You know, I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I...
I swear.
- So you didn't do the erasing?
- Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
I did once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking, and...
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I just...
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
- Let me get my toothbrush.
- Yeah.
Just...
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vimonos, snior.
I...
I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life last night.
That's better.
- This is weird.
- To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
- My name is Mary Svevo.
- "We've met, but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
- I have since decided that this is a horrible...
- Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
That sort of wounded puppy shit he does...
- ...you know?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
- The bloom is certainly fucking...
- ...off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...
- Patrick, get the fuck away.
- Oh,..
- ...sweetheart...
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Can we talk about it?
- No!
Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
- Hey, Clementine.
- Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
- Hi.
- because she would pronounce...
- library, "libary".
- Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
- You made me look skinny.
- ...amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- It's okay.
- ...so flashy in a kind of obvious way.
- But still, it seduces you...
- Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair... it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
- I do.
- The world's a goddamn mess...
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
I mean...
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecurethat she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't...
- ...do that.
- I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Bye.
- Bye.
- I thought I knew her so well.
- It was nice meeting you and all.
- But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
- What?
- I don't know.
- Just wait.
- What do you want, Joel?
Just wait.
I don't know.
I want you to wait for... just a... while.
- Okay.
- Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
I'm not perfect.
I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
- But you will.
- Right now I can't.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...
Last call... to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
Montauk train boarding on track "B."
I don't know why.
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It's Joel.
Joel!
Listen, I don't feel very well today.
No, food poisoning, I think.
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It's just tiny little rocks.
If only I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
She was nice.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention?
Hi.
I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
What are the odds?
Do I know you?
Do you ever shop at Barnes Noble?
Sure.
Sure.
That's it!
Yeah?
I've seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah.
I would have thought I would've remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.
What might?
It changes a lot.
The color.
That's why you might not recognize me.
It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
Right.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Yeah.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red...
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Fifty, maybe.
Someone's got that job.
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry.
I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Hey.
No jokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.
No?
I'm sorry.
Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."
Right?
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't know.
I just, uh...
You seem nice, so...
Oh, now I'm nice?
Oh, God.
Don't you know any other adjectives?
I don't need "nice."
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel?
It's Joel, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is,
I really like that you're nice right now.
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now...
I'm glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...
No, no.
I just...
Sure.
No.
That's okay.
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.
- Ohh!
Hey!
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
Hi.
I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.
It's cold.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There's a stalker book?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I gotta read that one.
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso.
I'm not, really.
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...
Um...
Never mind.
Sorry.
That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I'm just kidding!
Come on.
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don't know what to say.
You should read my journal.
I mean, it's just... blank.
Really?
Does that make you sad or anxious?
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah?
You're really nice.
Ohh!
God, I have to stop saying that.
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time of year.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I'll pack a picnic.
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.
And, um, we could...
Sounds good.
But I...
I should, uh, go.
Now.
You should stay.
No, I really...
I'm...
I...
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!
That'd be nice.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Mm-hmm.
You miss me?
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.
Oh!
You said "I do." I guess that means were married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It's really solid this time of year.
Whoa!
I don't know.
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Whew.
Oh.
So beautiful.
Isn't it?
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo!
Oww!
Ow!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!
Fuck it.
Ohh!
Oh, my ass!
I think I should go back.
Come on.
Come on!
What if it breaks?
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?
Come here.
Please.
Come on.
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.Whoa!
This is good.
Here, let me show you this one thing.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Come on.
Think I heard a crack.
It's not gonna crack or break or...
It's so thick.
Show me which constellations you know.
Um...
Oh.
I don't... know any.
Show me which ones you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here's Osidius.
Where?
Right there.
See?
Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry to wake you,but we're... here.
Ahh.
Can I come over to your house... to sleep?
I'm so tired.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just...
Yes?
Can I help you?
What do you mean?
Can I help you with something?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.
Oh.
Thanks.
We're looking for 159.
What number's that?
I don't know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...
Is that him?
I think so.
Yeah, that's him.
Wait.
That's him.
Hey, Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.
Right?
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It's 8:30.
Patrick, stop it.
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Whew.
Okay.
Showtime at the Apollo.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey.
Quiet.
Hey, Joel.
What's up?
Oh.
Hi, Frank.
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?
No.
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.
Oh, no!
Yes!
Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she's changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...
You won't believe it.
She's there with... this guy, this really young guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.
Excuse me?
Can I help you find something, sir?
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.
Hi.
How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored.
Pretty tired.
Uh-huh.
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.
Why?
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybody want a joint?
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No!
No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.
It's too...
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Right?
Right?
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.
Rob!
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn't about us.
I agree.
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!
That's great.
That's good.
Okay.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired after the new year.
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...
How about on the fifth?
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?
I'm Joel.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...
Mierzwiak.
Here.
Could you please fill this out?
I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.
I don't have a pen.
There's a pen right there.
Good morning.
Lacuna.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that offer.
That's done now.
That expired after the new year.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.
Boo!
Oh, my God!
Stan!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...
I assure you, no.
No.
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility."
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she ever went out with.
Oww!
Fuck!
God, Rob!
Give it a rest!
It's okay.
It's all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine.
She's like that.
She's impulsive.
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.
A lark.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
Okay.
I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.
Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.
Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to empty your home...
We want to empty your life of Clementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you.
Wake up, buddy!
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
Hello.
I'm right here.
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he...
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy this afternoon.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15?
Can you do that?
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.
He'll be handling your case tonight.
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.
Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
I'm sorry.
Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Is there any risk of brain damage?
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.
Nothing you'll miss.
Comfortable?
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.
Okay, let's get started.
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.
There's a good story behind this one...
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.
Just try to focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay.
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.
Very good.
- Here's another object.
- That's so...
Next item.
Okay.
Potato head.
Next item.
Okay.
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.
Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.
I'm...
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
I...
Why am I...
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
Why am I standing here and...
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.
Déjà vu.
This is so...
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm in my head already, aren't I?
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.
Very good.
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?
I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
Patrick?
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.
Does that help?
Are you sure you set that thing up properly?
How's that?
How are you today, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
That's better.
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We're almost done now.
Mmm.
Journal.
That would be invaluable.
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."
Whoa!
Jesus!
What?
What?
Come on!
Careful!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That's fine.
Let's not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.
Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there's sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can we just please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is the last time I saw you.
It's 3:00.
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don't call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
A wino?
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Your keys.
I was just...
I was just...
I won't need them anymore.
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.
Clem?
Got it.
Mary's coming over tonight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.
I like Mary.
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...
Yeah.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.
Yeah, the thing is, our situation is...
is a little weird.
My girlfriend situation.
I'm sure it is.
You gotta be...
Clem, let me drive you home.
Get out of my face, faggot!
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
You did it to me first!
I can't believe you did this to me.
Goddamn it.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you'll be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's... funny.
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That's this guy's girl.
Right.
Yeah.
Was.
We took care of that.
Oh, God!
Well, uh...
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
What?
You little fuck...
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, she was beautiful, and...
I stole a pair of her panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!
They were clean!
What?
D-Don't!
Stop!
Okay.
Yeah!
All right!
We got work to do.
Give me my papers.
There's, um...
There's more.
After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out.
You what?
Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!
Do you have... any idea... how unethical...
It's not really that bad.
What?
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!
There's someone here.
He stole your underwear.
I don't see anyone.
Joel?
Where are my boots?
Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
Potions.
Love potion, please.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!
Should've left you at the flea market.
First thing to do is... sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
Wanna go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No!
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?
I don't wanna talk about it here.
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!
We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God...
Mmm!
It's you, Joel.
It's you who can't commit to anything!
It's going!
It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done.
This is crap.
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary.
How's it goin'?
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.
Find us okay?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Hot!
Poor guy.
Mmm?
Oh.
Don't you have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.
Stan.
Stan.
There's more.
No!
Yes.
No!
Hey, hey!
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
Mmm!
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.
What's your Bartlett's?
It's a quote book, Patrick.
It's a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.
God!
Can you wake him up?
You can't wake him up.
Mmm.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don't trust me.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
I don't do that.
I want to know you.
Hmm?
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.
That's what intimacy is.
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.
I'm sorry.
It just... really just isn't that interesting.
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love?
November 19, 2003.
Dinner at Kang's again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
I like that.
How's the chicken?
Good.
More?
No.
No.
Thank you.
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's really...
- Gross.
- gross.
- It's just...
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.
Patrick, can we get through this?
Patrick.
Hey, Tangerine.
Oh, Patrick, it's you.
I'm so miserable right now.
Why?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Excuse me?
I'm so confused!
Can I help you find something, sir?
Confused?
What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.
Baby, come here.
Scared of what?
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
Where's the self-help section?
Do you think I'm ugly?
No!
You're beautiful!
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.
I don't know.
I
- I'm a mess, Patrick.
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...
Let him go, Stan!
Let him go.
I'll help.
See?
How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
You do?
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm!
Juicy!
And seedless.
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Oh, my God.
Clem?
This is pretty cool.
That's what they called themselves.
The Clash... the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard gives to the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again.
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Oh, my God.
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, let's go out dancing.
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure.
Yeah.
We can go next weekend.
No, no.
Now.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
Hi, it's Joel.
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.
Pick up!
Pick up, man!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hello?
Yeah, what's up?
I got into a little situation with the old lady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I owe you big-time.
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Charles.
Come on, Charles.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."
I'm so excited.
Yea.
I'm excited too!
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...
I got you this...
What?
thing, um...
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Oh!
Wow.
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.
Oh.
It...
It's gorgeous!
- You like it?
- Yeah.
It's just my taste.
Really.
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Am I ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can't believe I'm crying already.
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.
Like you don't matter.
So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can't be ugly!
Be pretty!"
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,
I would magically change too.
You're pretty.
Joely, don't ever leave me.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just... happy.
I've never felt that before.
Mmm.
I'm just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I'll give you a sign.
I wanna call it off!
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!
Is anybody there?
Clementine?
Joel?
Clement...
Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
What?
Where?
I have an idea of how to stop this.
Stop what?
Joely.
Come on, Clem.
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!
No.
Good.
Concentrate, Clem.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
Come on!
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Good.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.
Then...
What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Shit!
We're going to see my grandma.
Joel, why...
No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!
Please.
So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Wake me up!
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thought you understood what was going on here.
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her...
I don't know.
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed.
I know it.
I'm in my brain.
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.
How can I help you from there?
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.
Sorry.
Look.
Who's that?
Oh, he-he works for us.
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy.
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.
I want to go home.
Hey.
What?
Clem!
Wait.
Clem!
Clem?
They're erasing you.
I'm here!
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
I'm so stupid.
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.
Wake yourself up!
Okay.
You want me to wake up?
Okay.
Great.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.
Here we go.
That was a great idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.
Don't!
That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
It's a birthmark!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?
Fine.
Then what?
I'm listening.
I don't know.
You erased me.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this in the first place.
I'm sorry.
You...
You!
You know me.
I'm impulsive.
That's what I love about you.
Joel?
Mm-hmm?
I have another idea for this problem.
This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?
Oh, man.
I can't remember anything without you.
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.

It's working!
I'm a genius!
Joel?
Joel?
Where'd you go?
I'm supposed to come too!
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.
Absolutely!
Clem?
It worked.
My God, look at this!
Wow!
It worked!
Look!
Look at this dress, man!
Oh, my God!
Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right.
Mrs. Hamlyn.
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely!
Joely!
Is every little peanut under there okay?
Mm-hmm!
He's fine.
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.
Okay!
I'm just gonna wait right here.
Joel!
Hey, no, sweetie.
Uh, Joely.
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.
Come on, Joel!
Joel, grow up!
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel.
Joely.
Joel!
Stop it!
Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel.
Look!
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He's off the map.
He's off the map.
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean?
I don't know where!
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
Crap.
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
What shall we do?
Crap.
Crap.
I don't know!
I just said that I don't know what to do.
I'm sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.
Quiet.
You're freaking me out.
Shh.
Shh.
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh!
What, what?
What?
We should call Howard.
No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my...
I can handle this.
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.
He's...
There's no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what's the address?
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E. Rockville Center.
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?
I'm staying.
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.
I think you should go.
Hell, no.
Mary...
Shit.
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don't want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!
Joely, stop it!
Joel!
Look!
Hey, Joel!
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It's weird how strong that desire is.
Joel, look at me!
Look.
You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.
Pat?
I just...
Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy... he's copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You...
You're kind, beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh!
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Let's go.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I'm still stoned.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.
Be cool.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we?
Uh, yeah.
Um...
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.
Did you try going through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.
All right.
I already...
I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up.
I love being bathed in the sink.
Such a feeling of security.
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.
Hmm!
There it is.
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyes are open.
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.
Oh, this is...
this is not good.
No.
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to give him this.
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Okay, we're back in.
Wow.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
Thank you, Mary.
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?
Hmm.
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
Oh!
Oh!
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel...
What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Go on.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
That truck.
Doc?
Please.
All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember...
That's strange.
He's in a memory that we've already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?
Come on, Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!
I'm sorry, okay?
Let me drive you home.
No!
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait.
Howard.
He's disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.
I don't like it either.
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just...
Oh, um...
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.
Good night, sweetheart.
No.
I'm sorry, Joel.
Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
What?
Look where we are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.
Hit it!
Hit it!
I can't!
I gotta go home.
I'll do it later!
Come on, you big sissy!
Ooh!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
Wait.
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him!
Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la!
He's not listening!
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!
I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That's where I live...
lived.
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
It's my turn.
Go.
One, two, three.
I can?
You're really gonna die though.
Okay.
One, two, three.
You're dead.
Oh, my mom.
It's...
It's okay.
We're playing.
Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.
Clem!
Clem!
Jo...
Joely?
Are you okay, Joel?
Joel?
Joel?
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Cool.
Look out!
Look out!
Ah!
Shit!
It's fluff.
Our house!
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Whoo!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
We gotta go.
Aah!
Come on!
No!
This is a really bad time for this!
Get off me!
Oh, God!
I don't even know where we're going.
It's gonna be fun.
Come on.
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
No, no, no.
This way.
You're no help at all.
What's wrong with you?
Let go of me, Joel!
I like watching you work, Howard.
I guess, uh...
I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds.
It looks like you have everything under control here.
Yeah, that's, uh... that's fine.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.
Oh, no.
It's...
It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes...
Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot?
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire the work you do, Howard.
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.
I
- I
- I
- I
- I...
I'm happy to hear...
I'm sorry.
I've loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It's...
You're a wonderful girl.
But I...
You know, I have a wife and kids.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.
Oh, whoa.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh, my God!
Who is it?
Uh...
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.
Hollis.
Hollis!
Hollis!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.
I knew it, Howard.
Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!
I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
Yeah.
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell me what?
Oh, you poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
What?
Oh, uh,
we have a history.
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.
You...
You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh...
You could...
Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
Okay?
Hey.
Let me give you a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
I just needed to see ya.
Yeah?
I'd like to, um, take you out or something.
You're married.
Not yet.
Not married.
No, I'm not married, no.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there.
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive.
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hmm.
Probably.
I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that.
Mmm.
I know.
It would be different... if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there.
Okay.
I liked you immediately.
You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.
I wanted you to think I was smart.
I couldn't wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just...
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, God.
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh!
No, no, no.
Here.
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.
This is the day we met.
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out in the distance.
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt."
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer.
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.
You mean like...
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?
Yeah.
Like that.
Oh, no jokes.
No jokes.
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.
I think your name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it.
You married?
No.
Let's move into this neighborhood!
I do sort of live with someone though.
Male or female?
What?
Female.
Female.
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.
They might have a dog.
There's no dog.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.
Hoo-hoo!
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.
It's dark.
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...
We're...
Whatever.
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.
What?
I think we should go.
Why?
It's our house...
just for tonight.
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.
What are you do...
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.
So, are you okay with wine?
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
Ruth.
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.
I've gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I did.
I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting.
I wish you'd stayed.
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.
I wish I'd done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had...
I wish I'd stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
I walked out.
I walked out the door.
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.
You were scared?
Yeah.
Thought you knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Joely?
What if you stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There's no memory left.
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.
Let's pretend we had one.

Bye, Joel.
I love you.
Meet me in Montauk.
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.
It does.
That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
Who was that?
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right.
My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not.
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
Once, maybe.
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I saw you two talking.
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.
How'd I look?
You looked happy.
Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...
I don't know.
I just figured I was imagining things.
Aah!
Montauk train now boarding on track "B." All aboard.
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.
Just...
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.
What did I do?
I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.
Oh.
Whew.
Vámonos, señor.
I-I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night.
That's better.
This is weird.
To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.
My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met, but you don't remember me.
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."
I have since decided that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.
What is this?
I don't know.
He's boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me.
I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!
You clearly are.
Look, let's just take a minute and...
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Get the fuck away!
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really very educated.
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...
Hi.
because she would pronounce... library "libary." Hi.
Libary.
Libary.
Look what I found.
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting.
But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's okay.
So flashy in a kind of obvious way.
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things about you.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have any whiskey?
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.
Hey.
Sorry.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.
And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that about you.
- Because I don't.
- I know.
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.
What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don't know.
Just wait.
Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.
I'm not perfect.
I can't see anything that I don't like about you.
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Look at that.
Big, wide, beautiful, flat.
But pricey.
Check out all those zeros.
Is a four foot wide TV is a good idea when your living room is five foot square?
A man's TV should reflect his age.
You're 18 years old, 18 inch.
When you turn 27, 27 inch.
One of these monsters will do me till I'm 50.
You're not 50?
You're not fired?
* You can tell me that your dog ran away *
* Then tell me that it took three days *
* I've heard every joke, I've heard every one you say *
* You think there's not a lot goin' on *
* Look closer, Baby, you're so wrong *
* And that's why you can stay so long *
* Where there's not a lot goin' on **
I thought I had another flyer.
I chucked it, out there in the garbage.
Well, why would youGarbage?
throw away...
I'm an enigma.
Really?
Does that pay well?
Because your gas station career may be winding up.
Oh, no.
Here comes Hank.
Don't mention the TV thing.
Why?
Because he'll be at my place all the time and it'll get awkward telling him to get lost.
Really?
Hey, Hank.
Get lost!
Why would you say that?
You know what?
That is awkward.
Hank, do you like amethyst?
Yeah, you bet.
I think... what is she a stripper or a wrestler?
A stone.
I'm selling jewellery.
I made it myself.
You're selling jewellery now?
I have to do something when I'm unemployed.
Unemployed?
Do you want to buy some jewellery?
What am I going to do with girl stuff?
I'm a guy.
It wouldn't be for you.
It would be for someone special, a girlfriend or...
You're right.
You would have no use for this.
Duh.
Brent, I need to borrow some money.
Could you lend me...
Shssh, shssh, shssh, shssh.
Quiet.
What are we listening for?
The gas bell so I could walk away from ya.
Sorry, Hank.
I'm broke.
I was just complaining about money.
Wanda, tell him.
But don't tell him why.
He was just complaining about money.
Why?
I just told her not to...
Ah, there it is.
Why is the top of the sugar bowl open?
If it wasn't open on top, it wouldn't really be a bowl.
Why didn't you put the lid on?
I never put the lid on.
35 years and I'm always putting the lid on it.
I wish you would put a lid on it.
You can't leave the sugar open.
Germs and bugs get in there.
There's no bugs in there.
Oh, there would be.
You have no idea.
You've been living in a bug-free dream world, because I watch your back.
But no more.
From now on, you open the lid, you close it.
No more free ride.
Fine.
That's right.
That one's interesting.
Interesting?
That's something people say when they don't like something.
Oh, no.
No, they're definitely not
Oh, thanks.
You really don't find them interesting?
No.
No, no.
I'll take that one.
Ah, good choice.
That one's 80.
80 dollars?
Yeah.
You sure about that decimal point?
I'll get the cash from ya later.
Thank you.
Thank you, Wanda.
Hey, Lacey.
How's Brent?
Huh?
I mean, you know, financially, how's business?
Fine, I guess.
Well, there he is.
Looks about as busy as usual.
Picking garbage?
You sure business is okay?
Hey, do you like amethyst?
Nah.
I don't have to like that stuff.
I'm a guy.
You're lucky.
Plus we can pee standing up.
Oh, men are always bragging about that.
No brag, just fact.
Emma?
Emma!
Where are the towels?
In the laundry room.
What are they doin' there?
I take them down there and wash them, using something called a washing machine.
I know what a washing machine is.
* La, la, la, ah, ah ah.
La, la, la, la, hah-hah. *
* La, la, la, la, la...
So why aren't the towels up here?
From now on, you use it, you wash it.
No more free ride.
This is about that sugar lid, isn't it?
It's not broken.
No, no.
I'm just movin' up in the world.
I got myself a big screen TV, high definition, surround sound.
It makes you feel like you're right inside the show.
A general strike was called today by labour leaders in...
Do I come to where you work and crunch chips?
No.
But you're welcome to.
Yeah, okay.
I'll give ya 40 bucks for it.
Is somethin' the matter?
Ah, my dog died.
Mr. Scratchy?
Yeah.
Ah, no!
Mr. Scratchy was a great dog.
I loved Mr. Scratchy.
Yeah.
Poor Brent.
Hey.
Are these the same?
Well, one's a piece of jewellery and the other's a lawnmower.
Oh.
Wait.
This piece and this piece are identical.
Except this one's 60 bucks.
60 bucks?
What a hose job!
I paid 80.
Oh.
What a bargain.
I'm going to show Wanda.
Yeah.
Go show Wanda.
Show her what?
Hey.
Brent is poor.
What?
Poor.
He's got no money.
Brent is not poor.
I just saw him pawn his TV.
Really?
He loves TV.
It doesn't mean he's poor.
I saw him looking through garbage and Wanda said he might let her go.
Add this stuff up and it looks like Brent is broke.
Plus he said he was broke.
Have you talked to him about it?
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because we're guys.
We don't interact in a meaningful way.
It's one of the things that sets us apart from women.
Plus we stand up to...
Yeah, yeah.
Quit bragging.
No brag, just fact.
Look, we gotta do somethin'.
Poor Brent, sitting all alone up in his place, too proud to beg.
The federal government is expected to announce...
Oops.
Sorry, Lloyd.
Well, could I at least have a chip?
It's my last bag.
All right.
There's your change.
No, no.
You keep it.
What?
It's a tip.
A tip?
Why are you tippin' me?
It's okay, Brent.
You can pay me back.
I'm not paying you back.
It's a tip.
He's not poor.
Oh, hey, Brent.
Notice somethin'?
Usually not right away, but eventually.
No.
The pendant.
You didn't give me enough time.
This one was 20 bucks less than the one I got from Wanda.
You must really like pendants.
No.
I only bought it to be nice.
To look nice?
No, to
Not this pendant, the other one.
Oh.
When she sees it and I let it slip how much it cost, she'll know she ripped me off.
So you could say that was the being-nice-to-Wanda pendant and this is the teaching-Wanda-a-lesson-pendant.
I wish I hadn't brought this up.
Oh, wait, I didn't.
I'll show her.
What's this?
An improvement.
I'm improving' the room.
How?
By leaving it?
I've been sittin' where you want me to.
Now I'll sit where I wanna sit.
Is this about the towels?
That's right.
We had a deal, and you broke it.
The deal was I did the laundry and you sat on the couch?
Where
Now we arrange furniture my way.
We watch too much TV anyway.
So, Wanda, how are the fries?
Good.
Not too expensive?
The price was fair?
Sure.
Good fries at a fair price.
That's our slogan.
Catchy.
You know, I could charge more, but I don't, because, uh, that wouldn't be a fair price.
And the fries are good.
So good fries at a fair price.
It works on so many
I'm going to need more jewellery.
Pass the salt.
I'm not doing that anymore.
Fine.
Then I'm not changin' any more light bulbs.
Good.
Then I'm not putting the cap back on your toothpaste.
I don't need your cap.
Do you think it'll squirt outta the tube on its own?
Hey, Brent, do you think it's gonna squirt out on its own?
I'm on a tropical beach right now.
See?
He agrees with me.
Who put the couch here?
Pass me Dad's plate?
Man, I am havin' a great day.
Business is good, I'm getting tips.
I had my dad's lunch.
Hit me with shovel, I'd still be in a good mood.
I might take ya up on that.
Wow.
Nice rock.
Who ya tryin' to impress?
Well, Wanda.
I don't think she noticed.
Maybe you should send her flowers instead.
No.
I bought it to teach her a lesson.
Brent, I told you about it this morning.
Remember?
No, I think you're mistaken.
How can guys function with such a short attention span?
It's a gift, like being able to pee standing up.
Who can pee standing up?
It must be nice to tune someone out while nodding and adding a few, "Yeah, I guess's. "
Yeah, I guess.
Ooh!
Brent, how are you?
I'm fine.
Holdin' up.
Good, good.
Let me buy ya a coffee.
You don't have...
Well, I take it black.
And let's get him somethin' to eat.
Sure.
I'm not proud.
Chili cheese dog.
I thought you said you already had your lunch?
No.
I said I had my dad's lunch.
Then he said he's not proud.
He's lost his pride.
Aw, poor Brent.
He's not poor.
What's it take to convince you?
Look at him.
That's a broken man.
I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but I think my TV is too big.
Well, you sit a foot away from it.
Oh, man, I've got Burt Reynolds burned onto my retina.
You can't cure that with lasers.
Burt Reynolds?
Cannonball Run, Director's Cut.
He doesn't look that good.
He barely goes out anymore, just sits alone in his house.
His empty, empty house.
Surrounded by memories of better times.
Look at him.
Poor Brent.
Ahem.
God!
What is this?
I'm naked.
I didn't think you were holding a wrinkly purse.
What?
Why are you naked?
I used to walk around naked all the time, in my bachelor days.
Now you're not puttin' the cap on the toothpaste anymore.
The glory days are back.
Hope it doesn't bother ya.
It doesn't bother me.
Fine.
Good.
Take your hat off at the table.
Oh, hey, Davis.
Heya, Brent.
I had some extra groceries so... you have a big TV.
Yep.
It's huge.
That's what big means.
So you're not poor.
A man with a big screen TV is never poor.
Hey, what's with the groceries?
Oh, it's a police community relations thing.
Every now and then we randomly give somebody groceries.
Thank you for your co-operation in this program.
Hm.
Man, I'm havin' a good week.
Oh, hey, don't tell Hank...
I know.
You don't want him inviting himself over all the time.
Do you get kickboxing?
It's on the digital channels.
I wanna get those but I just dropped a ton on the TV.
So if you had more money, you'd get the digital channels and then I could come over and watch kickboxing?
Right?
Sure.
How can I say no to a man who brought me... lentils?
Oh, yeah.
Brent is poor, real poor.
We got to, uh, do more to help poor Brent.
What's that?
It's a curse jar.
You curse, ya gotta put money in the jar.
Whose jackass idea was that?
It was mine, ours.
Hey, Oscar.
You cursed.
Now ya gotta put money in the jar.
Go to hell!
Someone's gotta put money in the jar.
Rookie?
Oh.
Oh, do you like my bracelet?
Yeah.
And the earrings.
It goes nicely with your many pendants.
Are you some kinda jewel junkie?
No.
But isn't it funny that the pendant that I bought from you cost $80, and, ah, I can get all of this for 150?
150?
Yep.
Man, did you get ripped.
Well, that includes shipping.
Curse jar?
Whose jackass idea was that?
Come on, Brent.
It's fun.
Yeah.
A real hay ride.
It makes people feel Yeah.
good about cursing.
I do feel good, damn good.
Come on!
Oh, Emma?
I'm home.
Oh.
I forgot to say, if you're gonna stop wearing clothes around the house, I'm gonna stop telling you when guests are coming over.
I see.
Who was she?
I don't know.
I can't believe what a potty mouth town this is.
There's like 20 bucks here. 20 bucks?
Well, then, why don't you buy some jewellery?
It's my close-out sale.
Ah, purple's not my colour.
Buy some for Lacey.
She's a lunatic for this.
She does need some cheering' up.
She said, the other day, she was upset about something.
What's that?
No, can't remember.
So buy some amethyst. 20 bucks.
Done.
Thank you.
Look, I don't like amethyst.
Okay?
I only bought your stupid pendant to be supportive.
Then I open a catalogue and see the same pendant for 20 bucks less.
So don't you tell me that
This whole situation is...
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I just really had to get that off my chest.
If it bothers you that much, here's your 20 bucks back.
Thanks.
20 bucks.
I think that should just about cover it.
There, that's for you.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh, and this is for you.
Thanks.
Oh.
Hey, Hank.
Listen, I know we're guys and we shouldn't talk on any meaningful level, but are you poor?
Huh?
Poor, broke, you know, no money.
Look, will you turn down that big screen TV so we could talk seriously?
You have a big screen TV.
Hey, who invited him?
Come on in here, Hank.
Oh, more coffee, please.
Hank keep ya up late?
Oh, you don't know the half of it.
The guy comes over, plunks himself down on the sofa till like 1:30 in the morning.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, how come you're not wearing your amethyst stuff?
Oh.
I got rid of them.
Emma, you left the lid off the sugar bowl and look what got in there.
I did not.
Oh, Oscar.
I know I can be difficult occasionally.
It's lovely.
Now put your pants on.
But my legs get too warm.

- Well, mom, what do you think ?
- Oh, you look beautiful !
"Homecoming queen" beautiful, or "runner-up I wish I was dead" beautiful ?
Homecoming queen beautiful.
Not that I would know.
I never got to go to my homecoming dance 'cause your dad got sick and stood me up, leaving me at home wearing a taffeta dress and eating cookie dough.
Really ?
Homecoming queen beautiful ?
- Penny, what are you wearing ?
- My dress for the homecoming dance.
A group of us thought we'd mock the whole thing and show up dressed like zombies.
You look revolting.
Really ?
Zombie queen revolting, or just some dead girl revolting ?
Hey, Pearce, do you have a date for the dance yet ?
I'm not going.
It's a swing dance theme.
I thought you loved swing dancing.
I do, but there's no one at school who can keep up with me, and I am not going to pollute the purity of swing with some partner who doesn't even know the difference between a paddle turn and a sugarfoot.
You know, Pearce, I swing dance.
I know it might not be cool, but I could go with you.
Uh, mom, I love you... but you dance like a drunken penguin.
Parker!
Look how handsome you are !
And the best part is... it's free !
All he has to do is wear it to school every day until the dance, and say...
Terry's Tuxes are fan-tux-tic.
You're not going to make me wear one of those walking billboards too, are you ?
Oh, of course not.
On the way home, we passed a church fair, and, well, you know how I'm so good at whack-a-mole ?
Ha-ha!
You're freakin' kidding me, right?
You expect me to wear a stuffed bear's clothes ?
Well, it's not like it's the first time.
Remember that little yellow hat and raincoat we got you last year ?
Let me see you, already.
This is so embarrassing.
- What's so embarrassing about it ?
- It fits perfectly.
So, uh... who you planning on asking to go with you goldilocks?
No, tomorrow I'm asking...
Abby, Amy, Annabeth and Ashley.
What, you're going through all the hot girls in school alphabetically ?
I gots to get a hottie to go with me.
I mean, somewhere along the line, I lost my status as a stud.
Well, this may sound crazy but I'm just going to ask one girl who I really like Carrie Friedman.
Well, you'd better hurry, 'cause, um, I'm getting to the "cs" on friday.
Hey, Pearce.
Dude, I don't want to look like a dork in front of carrie.
Can you teach me how to swing dance?
Parker... the teacher comes when the student is ready.
- Uh, uh, I-I'm ready.
- Okay, let's dance.
I got us real cemetery dirt for our costumes.
Oh, my god, there's a maggot in here.
You're the best !
- Ow !
Get off my foot, you clod !
- Stop spinning me so fast!
What the hell are you guys doing ?
I'm trying to teach Parker how to swing dance, but grampa's heart had better rhythm.
I can help you demonstrate.
I know how to swing dance.
Who are you?
This is Matt, my gay and therefore ironic date to the homecoming formal.
You know how to "schwing", huh?
- West coast ?
- Sure.
- Lindy ?
- Yup.
- Hollywood ?
- Uh-huh.
- Balboa ?
- Of course.
- Shad ?
- Puh-leez !
Let's dance !
Bob, I was thinking about throwing the kids a little pre-homecoming party since it's part of the whole experience.
Not that I would know.
For the 400th time, I'm sorry.
I was sick that night.
Because you went to Atlantic City with your friends and got so drunk you were too hung over to go to the formal.
Get your facts straight.
I was not hung over.
I was still drunk.
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Chase.
- Bye, Matt.
- Bye-bye.
Isn't it great that Penny's going to the dance ?
Oh, yeah.
Her date is gay, and she's going dressed as a zombie.
Why don't you move the coffee table so I can do a cartwheel ?
I can't believe you.
You are such a jerk.
- Matt was my homecoming date.
- Hey, he asked me.
Maybe if you were more of a dancer you could hold onto your man.
Well, it looks like I'm going to get drunk this homecoming, too.
Hey, bro, what's going on ?
Oh, what a day.
I already got shot down by Barbara, Beth and Brandy.
- Hey, Brittany.
- No.
- Hi, Parker.
Cool tux.
- Thanks, Carrie.
Time to make my move.
- Chase.
- Ah...!
Hey, Gino, what's up?
My sister Gina wants to go to the homecoming formal with you.
Thing is, Gino, uh, I was already planning on asking... ask Gina now, or I'm going to shove him up you.
What did I do, bitch ?
Well ?
Hey, Gina.
Listen, um...
Did my brother just threaten you to ask me to the dance?
- Uh, actually, he did, yeah.
- Good.
Pick me up at 7:00.
Dad, I need some money to do my hair and makeup for the dance.
Sure, honey.
How much do you need ?
- $400.
- $400 ?
I buried an uncle for $300.
Dad, homecoming queen is at stake.
Carol, please tell her that there is more to life than winning homecoming queen.
That crown could have been mine, Bob.
All mine if it weren't for you.
Give her the money !
- Here's 20 bucks.
- Great.
I'm going to look like this guy.
- Hey, mom, dad.
- Hey, Pearce.
Uh, Matt and I are going to practice dancing in the living room later, so we're going to move some furniture around.
Already they're redecorating.
Pearce, it's fine if you move the living room furniture around.
- Are you gay ?
- Bob...
Hum...
I think what your father is wondering and we don't care either way, just as long as you're happy but we just want to know.
- Are you gay ?
- What ?
No.
Geez, just 'cause I'm going to the homecoming formal with a guy ?
This is about the purity of the dance. "Am I gay ?" does this look gay to you ?
Pearce cannot go to the dance with Matt.
If he does, he'll get made fun of for the rest of high school.
Why ?
Because people are going to think he's gay ?
Well, that would be easy.
If he were gay, he would have support groups, clubs, parades.
What's his chant going to be "I'm here, I'm weird, get used to it"?
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, traitor.
Hi, backstabber.
Come on, Penny, let's get past this.
Matt, you used to be a rebel.
A zombie.
What happened to you ?
I'm sorry.
I started dancing with Pearce and decided I want a more traditional homecoming experience.
This is all your fault, Pearce.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I am not the villain here, okay ?
He was abducted by an evil little kidnapper I like to call "the dance."
uh-oh, here he comes again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
- Sorry.
I forgot you were leading.
- Why don't you lead if it's easier?
That's why I thought I'd follow, to make it easier for you.
Dude, you, uh, don't have to make it easier for me.
What's going on ?
Are, are you guys fighting ?
No, we're not fighting.
You know what ?
Why don't we just take turns leading and following ?
- Great idea.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa ; wait a minute.
I mean, not to interfere, but, uh, shouldn't the better dancer do the harder steps ?
I mean, one of you has to be better.
So, who is it ?
- I mean, that's pretty hard to say, dad.
- Yeah, it is.
Although I might be a little more experienced.
- Well, you wouldn't know it.
- What's that supposed to mean ?
Uh, it means that sometimes your Tacky Annie is more Tacky than Annie.
Oh ?
Well, your Carolina Shim-sham is more like a Carolina Flim-flam.
Oh, snap !
You wish you had my steps.
Well, here's one step you might not be familiar with.
That's the best move you've had all day !
Come on, don't fight.
That's it.
Zelda just turned me down.
I have no one to go to homecoming with.
I guess you're stuck with your usual fall-back date that video you hide in your sock drawer.
Hey, Catherine Zeta Juggs is a very gifted actress.
Guess what ?
Jessica said we can share her limo to the dance.
- Oh, cool.
- See you later.
Dude, you asked Carrie Friedman to the dance ?
How did you get out of going with Gina ?
Uh, I haven't yet, but I'm about to.
- Is that an onion ?
- Yeah.
See, I'm going to make myself so disgusting, Gina won't want to go with me.
Dude, just stand up to her brother.
Don't be such a wuss.
Hey, Chase.
- Hey, Gina.
How are you ?
- What's that smell ?
Oh, it's probably my breath.
I have this little problem.
Gets worse at night.
Uh, or when I sweat, like from dancing.
Sorry.
- It smells like onion.
- I know.
I love the smell of onion.
I also love the taste.
Hey, Pearce.
How's the dancing going with Matt ?
I'm done dancing with Matt.
Didn't dad tell you ?
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, well, let me give today's headline.
Matt and pearce aren't going to the dance together anymore, because Matt thinks he's a better dancer than Pearce, but he's not.
Bob ?
Did you have something to do with this ?
Wasn't that too long for a headline ?
- You did this.
You broke them up.
- I did not.
- And I did it to protect him.
- I can't believe you.
Just because you were uncomfortable with who your son was taking to the dance, you had to ruin it for him?
Oh, it's just a dance.
He'll get over it.
Like I did, Bob.
Well, this is different.
I think he really wanted to get out of it.
I just gave him a little nudge.
And besides, you heard him.
He never wants to speak to Matt again.
- Hello.
- Is that Matt?
- I'm sorry.
No.
- Oh.
Good.
Mom, dad, I'd like you to meet my date for the dance.
Dead Pearce.
Oh, my god.
Honey, don't you think you've taken this grudge against your brother a little too far ?
Please.
I've totally moved on.
Hey, uh, Gina, I don't mean to gross you out, but do I got any bats in the cave ?
Ew !
You do !
Let me get it for you.
Patton, what are we gonna do, man ?
I can't get rid of Gina.
She's ungross-outable.
And Carrie's expecting me in 45 minutes.
You know, dude, normally I'd, uh, throw you a bone and take Carrie off your hands, but my dance card is full.
- Wait a minute.
You got a date ?
- I don't have a date.
I have the date.
Yeah, I know I might be dressed like a teddy bear, but this date's gonna take me from cuddly to studly.
- Hi, Bob.
- Hey, Tyler.
Come on in.
Paige, your date is here.
Oh, my god, what happened to you ?
You didn't give me enough money, so I had to borrow makeup and buy a cheap highlighting kit, and now I look like a rodeo clown.
- Okay, honey, we can fix this.
- How ?
In what universe could a homecoming queen have frizzy red hair ?
You're on your own.
You better get out there, man.
Gina's making her pirate tattoo talk.
That's it.
God, I better call Carrie.
She's never gonna talk to me again after standing her up.
Who's getting stood up ?
Uh, the girl I was hoping to take to homecoming before Gina's brother forced me to take her.
- What ?
- Come on, parker.
Let's get out of here.
- He is not going anywhere.
- Mom, what are you doing ?
I am not letting you and your neanderthal brother ruin my son's formal.
What a wuss!
You're having your mother fight your battles for you ?
!
- Gina, I didn't ask her...
- That disgusts me.
Really ?
Mommy, make the mean girl go away.
Don't worry, Paige.
We're going to be homecoming king and queen.
I can feel it in my bones.
- Watch it, pretty boy !
- Oh, Tyler, are you okay ?
- Oh, let's get you some ice.
- Oh, my nose.
Is it broken?
It is now.
Oh, sorry.
I-I got to get to carrie's.
Oh, my god, you're Catherine Zeta Juggs.
Are you Patton ?
The one who wrote me he's dying ?
No.
He is.
You the man !
- Hi.
Can I help you ?
- I'm Catherine.
- Patton's date for the dance ?
- What ?
Hi.
Bob Chase.
Uh, have we met before ?
I don't think so.
Huh. 'Cause I swear I've seen you somewhere.
I just can't...
I can't remember where...
Oh...
I'm Patton.
Come on in.
Hi, Patton.
Oh, you poor little guy.
Are you really dying?
Yes, I am.
You...
likey ?
Nice girl, huh ?
Bob, I am not letting Patton go to the dance with that adult film star.
What makes you think she's an adult film star ?
Bob, who do you think organizes your sock drawer ?
Hey, Matt.
Come on in.
Pearce, would you come downstairs, please ?
There's someone here to see you.
- What are you doing here ?
- Well, I got your flowers.
What flowers ?
I didn't send you any flowers.
- Well, I did.
- What ?
Listen, I was the one who caused that fight between you two, and I was wrong.
Well, it doesn't matter who started it.
You don't mock a man's hoofing and get away with it.
Hey, you're the one who dissed my Tacky Annie.
Oh, well, if the wing tip fits.
- That's it.
I'm out of here.
- Fine !
Five, six.
Seven, eight.
So, Matt, what you doing tonight ?
I'm going to the homecoming formal with the best dancer this side of st.
Louis !
Can't be, 'cause that's what I'm doing !
You did good, Bob.
Yeah, I reunited our son with his fella.
Let the bubbly flow.
All right, everybody, let's head to the dance.
Come on, tyler.
We've got homecoming crowns to win.
Oh, good news.
I think the bleeding finally stopped.
Oow !
Thorns !
Patton, you're not going anywhere.
- Carol, can I talk to you for a second?
- I'm sorry.
I'm not letting him go to the dance with that lady.
Oh, so in other words, it's okay for Pearce to go with a guy, but Patton can't go with a woman just because she's in show business ?
He's not going.
Like you didn't, Carol.
Like you didn't go.
Um, mrs.
Chase, can I have a word with you ?
Yes, miss Juggs ?
I just wanted to let you know how happy I am to be able to do this for Patton.
And for myself.
I never got to go to my homecoming.
- You didn't ?
- No.
I got stood up.
I sat home all night eating bonbons.
I ate cookie dough !
Listen, you go to the dance.
You live that dream.
I will.
Wow !
You are a really good actress.
Nice touch with the bonbons.
Thank you.
I mean, what kind of mother would deny her dying son his last wish ?
She's a monster.
Parker and Carrie were runners-up for homecoming king and queen.
They were beaten out by...
Pearce and Matt.
Penny and dead Pearce were runners-up for zombie king and queen.
They were beaten out by...
Paige and Tyler.
As desired, Patton became a legend at North Nutley High.
Every girl knew him as the creepy little guy who went to the dance with an adult film star.
As for us, I finally gave Carol the homecoming she always wanted.
We snuck in and danced the night away.
Even dead Pearce looked embarrassed.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred but forget what you heard I'm like James bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. Yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis lan.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Lmmediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole burn book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis lan.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, okay?
Now, I put $1 in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
Do you remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
Okay?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school, but, you know, this usually happens when the kid is five.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that man could fight the dinosaurs and the homosexuals.
-Amen.
-Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University, so it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm okay.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
-Yeah.
-Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
-Yeah.
-So, how was your summer?
I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
-I win.
-Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
-I'm from Michigan.
-Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
-Where are you, Cady?
-That's me.
-It's pronounced like Katie.
-My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
-And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
-Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
Okay.
Okay.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur, a stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
-Where are you going?
-I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
Okay.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
-Don't read ahead!
-No green pen!
No food in class!
Stay in your assigned seat!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
-Everything.
-Did you see nipple?
-It only counts if you saw a nipple.
-That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
-Yeah.
-It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice wig, Janis.
-What's it made of?
-Your mom's chest hair!
-I'm Janis.
-Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G14."
I think that's in the back building.
-Yeah, that's in the back building.
-Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
Health.
Spanish.
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
-Yeah, I like math.
-Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends, and I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex, because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position.
Don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
Okay, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
You'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
-What are you talking about?
-You're a regulation hottie.
-What?
-Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
-Who are The Plastics?
-They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange."
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials in Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
-Who cares?
-I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Wow, Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, J.V. jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
-Okay.
-Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
-My what?
-Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
-No, thank you.
-Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
-What?
-I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
-My mom taught me at home...
-No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
-I didn't say anything.
-Home-schooled.
-That's really interesting.
-Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
-Thank you.
-So you agree.
-What?
-You think you're really pretty.
-I don't know...
-Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
-Where did you get it?
-My mom made it for me.
-It's adorable.
-It's so fetch.
-What is "fetch"?
-It's, like, slang from England.
So if you're from Africa, why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
Okay, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
-It's okay...
-Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
Okay, you have to do it, okay?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
-Hey, get out of here!
-Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
-Why do you hate her?
-What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
-Well, my question is, why?
-Regina started this rumor
-that Janis was...
-Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look, this isn't about hating her, okay?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
-What do we even talk about?
-Hair products.
-Ashton Kutcher.
-Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
Okay, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
-Yes.
-No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were five.
I like you.
Go away!
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
-Cady, what do you say?
-He was so cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
-Fine.
-Were people nice?
-No.
-Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering Girl World.
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
And we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
Well, I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
Okay, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
And we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us, because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
-if it looks good on you.
-I wouldn't?
Right.
And it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
120 calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30% calories from fat.
It's 40%.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
-Who is it?
-It's a senior?
-His name's Aaron Samuels.
-No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
Okay, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
-Hey...
-Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
-Yeah.
-I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools around the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
-You'd be perfect for it.
-Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
Okay.
So think it over, because we'd like to get jackets.
Okay.
Hey.
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
-So how do you like North Shore?
-It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
-No!
No, no.
-No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa, by the watering hole when the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
There he is.
-And he's with Taylor Wedell.
-I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
-You're not gonna call him, right?
-Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
-Wedell on South Boulevard.
-Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
-Hello?
-Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
This is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
Okay, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Wow, your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
-Hi.
-Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, okay?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
-Please stop talking.
-Okay.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
-The Spice Girls?
-I love her.
She's like a Martian.
-God, my hips are huge!
-Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
-My hairline is so weird.
-My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4:00 to 6:00!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Why?
Do you want a little bit?
'Cause if you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
-No, thank you.
-Okay.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
-Could you go fix your hair?
-Okay.
You girls keep me young.
I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
-I haven't looked at that in forever.
-Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
-"Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
-Still true.
-"Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
-Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
-Who is that?
-I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only okay when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
-about all the girls in our grade.
-What does it say about me?
-You're not in it.
-Those bitches.
-Will this minimize my pores?
-No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
-No way!
-Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
-I don't steal.
-That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately-priced soaps are my calling.
-You shopping?
-No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
-I think I'm gonna do it.
-Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
-Hello?
-I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care.
Do whatever you want, but let me just tell you something about Aaron.
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
-Is that bad?
-But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
-No.
-Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
Okay, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October third, he asked me what day it was.
It's October third.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
-It's raining.
-Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster, so I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
-But I wasn't lost.
-Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
Okay.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
Do you wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
Okay.
That flyer admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
Grool.
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great."
Right.
Well, grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Okay, I lied, but I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
-What are you?
-I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule, so I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
-Okay, you did not just say that.
-What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
-Right.
-So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
-then you have your second cousins...
-No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
-Hey!
-Hey.
You made it, and you are a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife."
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
-Yeah.
-Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
-Don't, Karen...
-Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
-You know that girl Cady?
-Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful, because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says, "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
-Oh, come on.
-Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And, okay, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
-Oh, no, Cady.
-Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
-saying that Janis was...
-Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, okay?
-We're gonna do something.
-We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy, technically good physique
and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
Okay, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back, and that's not Regina's fault.
-No, I know.
-Okay, so you're not mad at Regina?
-God, no.
-Okay, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
-I wanna lose 3 pounds.
-You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
Your hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
Okay.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
-Say "crack" again.
-Crack.
-All right, let's reconvene tonight.
-I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
We're doing a dance to this song...
-Jingle Bell Rock.
-Jingle Bell Rock.
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
-Hey.
-Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know.
I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend, Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them.
I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into,
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
-Candy-cane grams!
-Okay, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
-It's Cady.
-Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
Okay, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful...
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today...
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo.
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like, "Kevin G!"
Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. and the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
-What?
-I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
Well, that was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And, finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing Jingle Bell Rock.
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
-That was awesome.
-Lip gloss.
-Hey, good job, Africa.
-Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
-You totally have a crush on that guy.
-No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him, and he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"Okay, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become okay for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
Okay, if you even knew how mean she really is...
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep, but really she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
-Hey.
-Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
-Ephedrine?
-No.
-Phentermine.
-No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
-You're so skinny.
-Shut up.
Yes.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
Okay, you have really good eyebrows.
-Thanks.
-Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life, than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80% of my time talking about Regina, and the other 20% of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me, but I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So you should take a night off from your double life.
-I want you to see it.
-Coolness.
What is that smell?
Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
-How'd you do?
-Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
-Wrong.
-But then when I checked it, I got one.
There you go.
I got one, too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
-It's not fair to Regina.
-Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
-Then why do you like her?
-Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
She's just more up-front about it.
Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell.
I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
-Nobody understands me.
-I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's okay.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
-What do you mean?
-It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows.
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
...is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there, too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
-It won't close.
-It's a 5.
Okay, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that.
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
-Really?
-Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
-How would you know?
-I know,
"How would I know," right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you, because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
-Like a drug pusher?
-Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is, is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
-Hold on.
-Are you okay?
-Hello?
-If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
-No.
-What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...
Hold on.
Other line.
-I'm not taking this anymore.
-Good for you, Gretch.
-Hello?
-Let's go out.
Okay, hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
-Hold on.
-Okay, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
-Why?
-You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
-Who's this?
-Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
-Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
-I know.
Just get rid of her.
Okay, what is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
-Little harsh, Gretch.
-Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
-Yes.
-Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
-So?
-So that's against the rules, and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
-Because that vest was disgusting.
-You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
-So, what are we doing this weekend?
-Yeah, what are we doing?
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...
We have tickets for this thing.
-What?
-What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
-Is Regina going?
-No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
-Fine, I'll go.
-Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
-You look awesome!
-You look awesome!
I know, right?
Okay, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
-Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
-No.
Dude, put on the Ramayana Monkey Chant.
-Do I know you?
-Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
-Who does she think she is?
-You're right, hon.
I like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
-I love you.
-I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
-Oh, no.
-Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me, too.
Wow, you look...
-New clothes?
-Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I've wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
Okay, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
-Her property?
-No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
-I wasn't...
-God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
What is this?
Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
Okay.
Call me.
-Oh, God.
-You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1:00 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You know what?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me or something!
-What?
-Oh, no, she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
-I'm starving.
-Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."
Fat whore.
Okay, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry.
We're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
-What's going on?
-Have a seat, Miss Heron.
-Have you ever seen this before?
-No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours.
It's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book because everybody likes us, and I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
"And so did Sun Jin Dinh."
You little slut!
You're the slut!
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it.
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
-"Janis Ian, dyke"?
-That's original.
-"Too gay to function"?
-Hey!
That's only okay when I say it.
-Did you write this?
-No, I swear!
-Then you told somebody!
-She told!
-You little bitch!
-You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
-Now, here's what we're gonna do...
-Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the South Side for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium, immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior, and from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
-No!
-No!
-No.
-What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ, but don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes.
I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4:00.
I will keep you here until 4:00.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
Okay.
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something that you can say to these young ladies, something to help them with their self-esteem.
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
Okay.
Okay.
Everybody, close your eyes.
All right.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
Okay, so what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us, and it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder, and Dawn agrees with me.
-Dawn?
-Don't drag me into this.
I'm pitching tomorrow.
Why are you scamming on my boyfriend?
You're just jealous because guys like me better.
Nigga, please.
Okay.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
Okay, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
Okay, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it okay for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
Okay, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes Noble,
"and I'm sorry I told everyone about it,"
and I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
"I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
"I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles,
"and we'd all eat it and be happy."
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
Okay, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
"I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me,
"but I can't help it that I'm popular."
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
Okay, walk it off.
Walk it off.
Okay, that hurt.
They're okay.
They're okay.
Oh, boy.
Okay, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
Okay.
Yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year, and I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady.
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding, but she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around, but that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
-Everybody done?
-No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
-Does that mean anything to you?
-No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog.
You're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
-Why?
-I'm failing.
Okay.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or ecstasy tablets?
-No.
-What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron, but after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up,"
this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do, suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
-I'm just done with my quiz.
-Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
Well, you didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
-All right.
It's all you.
-Okay.
-Make me look good out there.
-Okay.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
-You nervous?
-Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...
-North Shore?
-Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
-Marymount?
-741.
-Correct.
-Shoot.
I was really rusty.
-Where's Cady?
-She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
-North Shore, who do you select?
-The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl, too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher, and she had some 99c lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
The limit is negative one.
Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
Okay, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
-the North Shore Mathletes.
-Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
-Africa, you did the damn thing.
-Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
-Oh, no, I'm not going.
-What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
Okay, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners, and I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
-Shane Oman.
-Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Wow.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me and the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before, and when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So, why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
-Hey.
-Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're okay.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class,
I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
-Thanks, sucker.
-Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
-How's your stomach now?
-It's fine.
-Do you feel nauseous at all?
-No.
-Have you been drinking?
-No.
Okay.
Grool.
-No.
-No.
-What's up?
-Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
-Lebanese.
-I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect, because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30% chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred but forget what you heard I'm like James bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. Yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis lan.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Lmmediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole burn book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis lan.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
More time stability and some other correction by:
Klaff2004
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm16anduntiltoday, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-achion rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eigtht period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A- sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orctard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
when the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things...
- ...about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P. J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only,so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one nigth a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could tear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the figthing had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practise for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
# Every day is so wonderful #
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
# I am beautiful in every single way #
# Yes, words can't bring me down #
# Yes, words can't bring me down #
# Don't you bring me down today #
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
# Yo, yo, yo #
# All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me #
# From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G #
# I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred #
# But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third #
# Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor #
# The G is silent when I sneak in your door #
# And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor #
# I don't play it like Staggy You'll know it was me #
# Because the next time you see her She'll be like #
- # Kevin G!
#
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
What?
I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
# Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock #
# Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring #
# Snowing and blowing Up bustels of fun #

That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
What's so great about Caesar?
Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
And when did it become OK for one person to be the boss of everybody?
Because that's not what Rome is about!
We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kalteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got...
- ...one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kalteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kalteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my touse at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kalteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch."
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea"
"at Barnes and Noble."
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Gething hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-achion rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eigtht period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A- sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orctard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
when the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P. J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one nigth a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
Ste was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could tear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the figthing had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practise for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent when I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Staggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bustels of fun
Now the jingle top has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a brigth time It's the rigth time
To rock the nigth away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-torse sleigh
Giddyap jingle torse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
What's so great about Caesar?
Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
And when did it become OK for one person to be the boss of everybody?
Because that's not what Rome is about!
We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
Ste knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my touse at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch."
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea"
"at Barnes and Noble."
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Gething hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-achion rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eigtht period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A- sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orctard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
when the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P. J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one nigth a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
Ste was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could tear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the figthing had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practise for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent when I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Staggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bustels of fun
Now the jingle top has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a brigth time It's the rigth time
To rock the nigth away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-torse sleigh
Giddyap jingle torse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
What's so great about Caesar?
Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
And when did it become OK for one person to be the boss of everybody?
Because that's not what Rome is about!
We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
Ste knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my touse at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch."
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea"
"at Barnes and Noble."
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Gething hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
Your recent operations have been failures.
I have doubts about your present proposal.
Yes, sir.
Governor, in my opinion, these sea battles are risky.
Why not save all this precious money and spend it on the police?
We can capture the pirates this time.
According to your records, this is what happened two years ago.
You couldn't even find where the pirates were.
And with the wind two ships were lost.
A sudden typhoon came!
How do you explain last year?
You were so certain that you could capture the pirates, but you got lost in the sea and ended up in Bangladesh.
You were almost starved to death.
Can you explain that?
I was never good at geography.
You've wasted most of the budget.
We've not had a pay rise for two years because of this.
Do you know that my officers are complaining?
That's your problem, it's not mine.
You'd better think again.
I'm against taking unnecessary risks.
And so am I.
All right, if you're confident it'll work, then go ahead.
Dragon!
You're wanted immediately.
Dragon!
Go get these papers signed.
Thanks.
Morning.
Are you in a hurry?
Morning, sir.
Captain Chi, please sign this.
All this ammunition, is it necessary?
Is this another world war?
We need that much to fight the pirates.
Aren't you aware that we have to deal with street crime?
OK, you take all the ammunition, we can still manage to do our jobs.
Corporal.
Yes, sir.
Tell our men to practise running.
No shooting at criminals, we'll run after them instead.
Yes, sir.
Does that satisfy you?
If you hit the target every time, a bullet can kill one pirate, and a cannonball can kill a few dozen pirates.
Then you won't need so much ammunition.
Captain Chi, if you don't want to give it to me, just say so.
How dare you talk to your superior like that?
!
Look at yourself.
You coast guards can't even stand correctly.
You've been at sea for too long.
Do they ever teach you what discipline is?
You may go now.
Once I sign this, I'll give it to the armoury department.
Wait a second!
Lucky for you you're not in my department.
Dismiss.
Yes, sir.
Are you writing to your mum?
Tell her not to worry, we'll be back real soon.
Don't forget your life jacket.
I'll sleep in it.
Why are you all so sad?
Grin and bear it!
You all look so gloomy!
We're not dead yet.
The cops are watching us.
Show some spirit, can't you?
Dragon.
Is everybody here?
Are we leaving?
Sure.
We're sailing tomorrow night.
Why have you got such long faces?
Waiter, beer for everyone!
Thank you, sir.
It's very busy tonight.
Tzu, over here.
Beer for everyone.
You're late.
Sit down here.
This is my girlfriend
- Chu.
Waiter, here.
Waiter, get us some beer.
Beer.
Who keeps the sea safe?
The coast guard!
Who's the toughest?
Coast guard!
It's them again.
Drink to the greatest!
Don't your customers get served?
They're going to die.
Don't be like that.
What did you say?
You're going to die!
Forget it.
I'm coming.
Hurry.
Your order, please?
Beer.
Four beers.
May I join in?
Winnie.
Sit down.
Are they celebrating something?
They're celebrating going to capture the pirates.
They may not come back.
A glass of milk, OK?
Not milk.
I'll buy you a beer.
All right, then.
No wonder we don't get a pay rise.
These bums waste good money chasing after pirates.
Actually, they couldn't even locate where the pirates were.
Come on, don't get upset.
Even now, they have no idea where the pirates are.
Say that again!
No trouble.
Stay calm.
Tai-po, get the check.
Get the check.
Sha, taking a vacation soon?
That's right.
Are you going home?
To Canton.
The sea's full of pirates, don't take a boat.
How can he get there, then?
He can always walk.
Do you feel safe walking on the road?
Mind your own business.
Ladies and gentlemen, we admit the sea is not safe now and we apologise.
My uncle is coming to Hong Kong and he's walking all the way from Canton.
But he's blind, how can he manage it?
But his ears are very good.
When he hears someone selling cookies...
He's reached Yuen Long!
When he can smell roast goose...
He's in Shen Jang!
And when he can hear whistles?
Whistles.
He's in Hong Kong Island!
That's right.
Even children know this song.
One, two, three, four, A, B, C, D
The cops whistle when the criminals run away
Whistle...
The cops whistle when the criminals run away
Whistle...
Bastard!
The cops whistle when the criminals...
Easy!
No fighting!
Stop it.
Stop fighting.
Do you hear me?
Stop it.
Come on.
Can nobody take a joke today?
We're sorry.
Let's toast to friendship.
Let's not fight each other.
Why are you so rude?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Let's go.
I'm OK.
I spilt some beer, but I've made my toast so no matter.
Let's go.
You dirtied my best suit.
I apologise.
But I don't forgive you.
You have two choices, pal.
You can say you are sorry or...
I won't say sorry.
I choose the second one.
We're all friends, aren't we?
Not any more.
I'll give him a mouthful.
Where is he?
What are they doing?
The cops are fighting with the coast guards.
Stop fighting.
Stop this at once.
Police!
We're all for law and order here!
I'm going to get you.
I'll get back to you later.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
Why did you hit me?
!
I'll get him, be sure of that!
221!
I've got your number.
I'll give you all this spaghetti!
221!
I'm here.
What is it?
Nothing.
Stop fighting.
You are supposed to represent law and order.
Arrest them.
Yes, sir.
Uncle.
Come on, get up.
Get yourself out of here.
You know we're sailing tomorrow, you really can't detain my men.
Only some are detained.
You have all my navigators locked up.
Just because you don't want us to sail.
I informed the governor.
I suppose you informed him your nephew started it.
Attention.
Can you let them go now?
My thanks to the captain.
All right.
I want no more trouble.
Father.
Go home.
Admiral, sir.
Sorry about the trouble we caused.
Don't apologise.
If I was in your position,
I'd beat them to hell.
I never could stand the smell of cops.
Get out of here!
Fall in.
Attention.
Left, left right left
Left, left right left...
Present arms.
Left and right turn.
Present arms.
Order arms.
Our mission is to capture those pirates.
Yes, sir.
When you see them, what should you do?
We will never let them go.
What if you are wounded?
We won't feel the pain.
And when you're captured?
Well?
What is it, then?
Guard, come here.
Talk...
Talk or you'll be shot dead.
Good.
Keep silent if you're captured.
Dismiss.
Ready for inspection.
Listen up, boys.
If you can fight the pirates like you fought the police, then you're sure to win.
We're sure to win.
We built five ships, why are there only three?
Governor, the other two are submerged.
I thought we couldn't see them because they were submarines!
Three ships will be too crowded.
They may be overcrowded, but it shouldn't be a problem.
They won't be crowded when returning.
Ready.
Attention.
Right turn.
March.
Put the fire out.
Two ships are on fire.
Then get water.
Get water!
I'll arrange for a ship to take you to Vietnam.
Don't worry about it, I know what to do.
Excuse me, I have some business now.
Chiang, the cops are looking for you.
You keep out of trouble.
Thanks to your information, we've blown up their ships.
They're better off this way.
If you had blown them up at sea, they would have had to swim home.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
All my ships travel safely now thanks to San-po's protection.
I should really thank him.
I'm happy to hear you say that.
San-po would like a favour from you.
He needs 100 rifles like this.
I'll see you get paid well for it.
Sure, I know what to do.
Cho-kou... it won't be a problem.
We're counting on you.
Bye now.
Take care.
But Boss, those are police rifles.
Where can we get that many?
It'll be tough, but we'll manage it.
We need a good man for the job.
What about Chiang?
No.
He's a wanted man now.
Contact Fei.
Are you sure?
He's expensive.
Don't worry about it.
We can always kill him afterwards.
West.
Full house.
On what?
On a West.
Where did you get that?
!
You're blind.
He threw away a Circle.
The West was discarded ages ago.
Now what?
you should be fined.
Pay the fine.
Pay up.
I'm finished.
Fine.
we need one more player.
I'll join you.
Banker.
Price it.
Fei, I'll make it quick.
Can you take a look at this?
A broken rusty watch.
Three dollars.
It's Fei's watch.
You can be sure it's real gold. 100 dollars.
Not this one.
Forty Thousand.
Wait.
It's time we saw the colour of your money.
Place your bets.
Today is my day.
Nothing I can do.
Can't you be more careful?
Eight Circles.
Hold on.
What are you doing?
Sorry, Fei.
Your turn.
Six Sticks.
You're not going to win this game.
Twenty Thousand thrown away.
No.
Honestly.
Are you accusing me of being blind?
Am I right?
He discarded Five Circles.
Right?
No.
Will you swear to it?
Sure.
I will swear to it.
Everybody, on my life I swear I've just discarded Five Circles.
I didn't throw away Twnety Thousand.
Five Circles?
That's right.
Let's see.
I won!
I won this game.
You are good.
Thank you.
Come on, give me my money.
That's it.
Hold it!
I saw you cheating.
I saw you cheating.
Sorry.
Don't worry.
It's my turn now.
Get up.
Please, no!
It's my turn now.
What's the hurry?
Maybe I can win again.
It's a full house.
Nobody can argue with this.
Hello, Fei.
We want a favour from you.
Do you know how much money I was going to win?
This is my new plan for capturing the pirates.
It's called Project A.
First of all, we need to buy new ships.
Go home and get some rest.
I'm not in the least bit tired.
Secondly, we need more new recruits.
Let me tell you, your men have disappointed me a lot.
I'm turning them over to Captain Chi for some hard training.
Now you're in charge of fundraising.
A British ship has been sent to capture the pirates.
I want you to get out now!
Change into these uniforms.
Why?
Captain Chi's orders.
These are police uniforms.
Are you kidding?
The governor disbanded our squad.
I don't care what I wear, as long as I still get paid.
It's better than fighting the pirates.
Congratulations.
Congratulations on your new status.
Now you don't need to endure the hardship of the sea.
And you, sir?
Me?
Didn't you hear about my promotion to chairman of fundraising?
What exactly is that?
Go change your uniforms.
Come on.
Attention.
Change uniforms at once.
That's my last order.
I think it's time to report in.
Go on.
Reporting for duty, Captain Chi.
From the coast guards.
Sergeant Ma?
We've been disbanded, sir.
Shut up.
I don't care what you did in the coast guards, you're in the police now.
When you answer an officer in this force, answer yes or no.
Just look at you.
Attention.
You call that attention?
I'll teach you how to stand.
Stand to attention.
Stand up, chest out, stomach in.
From the nose to the toes, there's a straight line.
Is your number 213?
Answer me.
Yes, sir.
Do you think you're stupid?
Answer me!
No, sir.
Not bad at all.
Captain Chi.
Just in time.
Meet Sergeant Ma.
This our new inspector, Hong Tin-tzu.
Inspector Hong is an excellent officer.
He'll be your squad leader and train you to be a Special Mission squad.
You may leave.
Dismiss.
Sergeant.
For the last time, what is the correct salute?
Yes, sir.
We're in trouble.
Start training them tomorrow.
If you want them to listen to you, be sure to give them a hard time.
Yes, sir.
Come on, fall in.
Attention.
Salute.
You, come here.
Salute, Private.
Stand up, chest out, stomach in.
Do it 500 times.
Yes, sir.
I don't care how sloppy you were before, you're in the police now.
As a policeman you have to be fit...
Look at that chick over there.
She's got a crazy figure!
She's a bit of all right.
209 and 214, come out here.
What were you talking about?
He said look at that chick.
He said she had a crazy figure.
He said she's gorgeous.
Go repeat it 500 times.
1000!
Yes, sir.
Look at that chick over there.
She's got a crazy figure.
Look at that chick over there...
She's got a crazy figure.
Who was laughing?
It was me, sir.
Here.
Laughing on parade.
Yes, sir.
Were you the only one laughing?
Yes, sir.
Do you know the punishment for it?
To laugh 1,000 times.
Shoot him dead.
Look at that chick there.
She's got a crazy figure.
Attention.
About turn.
About turn.
About turn.
Double march.
Sir, we've finished.
He fainted before the execution.
Then he can clean the toilets.
Look at that chick.
She's got a crazy figure.
Look at that chick.
She's got a crazy figure.
Look at that chick.
She's got a...
What's up?
That was some dream.
I hit Tzu really hard.
Let me sleep!
Why is there an emergency call now?
There must be an emergency.
Nonsense.
Put on your uniforms.
Quick.
Attention.
Salute.
You drank too much soup last night so you need the toilet now.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Take them to the toilets and then dismiss them.
Yes, sir.
Turn left.
Stand by.
Into attack.
Forward.
In our squad, speed is essential.
It's very simple.
You have ten seconds.
Stand by.
Ready.
Go.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
You must understand that I'm training you to be alert day and night.
OK, my turn.
Do you have ten seconds, too?
Instructors are allowed 45 seconds.
Give me a water ladle.
Give me one.
Hurry!
Give it to him.
That's an order.
We might have to use some deadly weapons on our missions.
This is the latest hand grenade.
You might not know it.
I will give a demonstration.
Pull the pin out and throw it within ten seconds.
Bang!
It's just exploded.
Got it, boys?
Yes, sir.
Big Mouth, get the grenade.
Yes, sir.
Did you switch them?
Yes, I did.
Sergeant, did I say you were outstanding?
No, sir.
Step back in line.
Let's take turns at throwing it.
Yes, sir.
Sir, he doesn't know how to use it.
Yes, I do.
Can you show us again, sir?
OK.
Watch carefully this time.
Firstly...
Do you think I'm stupid?
No.
But that's a real grenade.
Pull the pin.
This time I'll throw it towards you.
So watch out.
Quick!
It's a real grenade.
Look out!
Squad, sit down.
We've been given orders to arrest Chiang.
We've heard that he's hiding in the Hoover Club.
We've been given orders to go to the Hoover Club to arrest Chiang.
One problem is that important people use this club.
We must arrest Chiang discreetly and not disturb the members in the club.
Do you all understand?
Understood, sir.
I can't do it alone.
I'll let you know when I've made my mind up.
You better make it quick.
The quicker the better.
Don't cause a disturbance until we find Chiang.
We all know what to do.
You cover here.
Come on.
Membership cards, please.
Police.
Can I help?
That's not a membership card.
We suspect you're hiding an escaped criminal.
Wait there.
What's the matter?
This is a private club.
Our members are rich and famous.
You can't disturb our members.
If you don't understand, I can interpret that for you.
He said our members are rich and famous people.
There are no criminals here.
So, excuse me.
Front door's there.
Can't we come in for a drink?
No disrespect, but how much do you earn a month?
Even a glass might be worth more than your savings.
Stop!
I said stop.
Calm down.
He was trying to tip them off.
Lucky I didn't break any glasses.
Do you know who my boss is?
!
I don't need to know.
We want to have a look around.
Fine.
Take a look.
Leave when you've finished.
You've seen everything.
That's the manager's office.
It's the cops.
Chiang, coming out quietly?
All the bad guys are here.
That'll save me some work.
We're arresting you for murder and drug trafficking.
And for insulting a policeman.
This is the warrant.
You know the charges!
We've come for an arrest, not a fight.
Beat him up!
Don't be afarid.
We're police.
You can't go up.
Get lost!
You have to pay for all the damage here.
Do you understand?
Speak Chinese!
You have to pay for all the damage here.
Get him.
Keep out of sight.
Go on.
Look at this mess!
Stop it.
I said stop it.
Captain.
Do you have a warrant for this?
No.
Sergeant Ma.
We were informed the murderer Chiang was here.
So where is he?
Upstairs.
How dare you!
You're trespassing on my property.
Captain, your men should join a demolition squad.
Do you know what you're doing?
You are more experienced than Tzu, you should have known better.
Uncle...
That's enough.
Sergeant, apologise to Mr Chou.
To him?
But we did nothing wrong!
They're hiding criminals and have assaulted us.
Apologise?
!
Captain, I'll tell the governor that you allowed these men to slander me.
Come back.
You'll see if it's slander.
I said apologise to Mr Chou.
There's a punishment for disobeying an order.
So be it, then.
I quit.
I am no longer a policeman.
No more orders.
How dare you!
Stop him.
Everyone stay where you are.
You take the credit.
I'm always the bad guy.
Dragon.
You almost hit my nose!
How are you?
You don't treat friends like this.
It's not my fault if you have the hump.
Were you in the club?
When I saw you guys move in,
I knew something was in the air.
In this world of evils, no man stands alone.
I won't join your thieving ways!
Don't mention that word.
Since you joined the force, I've gone straight.
How else could we be seen together?
I guess some are delighted that you quit.
Why?
You want to get rid of the pirates, but not everyone is like you.
Really?
Yes.
Why did your ships get blown up?
Someone betrayed you all.
You're guessing.
I'm not.
The pirates are getting rifles from somebody inside your force.
News!
Read all about it.
Pirate San-po strikes again.
Three dead, 24 injured.
Read all about it.
Who'd sell to pirates?
Why do you want to know?
I want to know who would be so cold-blooded.
Thanks.
Why do you know so much?
Are you thinking of stealing them?
In life there are four kinds of people.
I don't qualify as a rich man.
I don't like being poor.
The cops don't want me so I have to be a thief.
As you're my friend, I'll try to be a good thief.
In this rifle deal, everyone is a bad guy.
You can get your man and I'll get my money.
And we both win.
Tell me where.
At the jetty.
Everything's in order?
Here's the rifles.
Thank you.
Get them on board.
OK.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The pier's moved!
Get him up here.
Quick!
Someone's there!
It's me.
Do you know you're committing a serious crime?
And selling arms to the pirates is a crime.
How shall we punish him?
Chop off his head.
Yes!
We'll chop his head off.
We're surrounded by water.
I can't find an axe.
So... we have to let them go.
We'll kick them in the water.
Why didn't you jump?
I can't swim.
Really?
I can't.
Now what?
What now?
Why can't you swim?
It's never too late to learn.
Give this to him.
Now swim and swim!
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Help!
I can't swim!
Let's go.
Help me!
Help me!
What will you do with them?
Find some buyers, of course.
Yeah, they'll make good money.
You're not going to sell them to just anybody, are you?
These are guns, not toys.
Don't worry.
I'll sell them back to the army.
Are you happy now?
Then I'm glad I helped you.
What's that for?
We have to identify which log it is.
Remember, it's only you and I in on this.
Have you finished, Fei?
This way.
Have you got the money?
Here.
And the rifles?
I wouldn't keep rifles here.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Now, where are the rifles?
They're in the log yard.
I'll take you there in the morning.
There's so many.
Which one is it?
Easy.
I fixed a red cloth on it.
Right there, see?
They all have a red cloth.
Which one?
What now, Fei?
Which one is it?
Looks like we'll have to turn them all over.
OK, guys, get started.
Listen, Fei, be smart with us.
We can get rough.
Mind your manners.
You guys get soft living the high life.
You double-crossed us.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Tell us right now or we'll kill you.
Everyone leave.
This place is closed to the public today.
Come on, split.
You sold us out to the cops.
It's not my day.
Why are you still here?
I'm an undertaker.
His father is going to die and he's looking for a nice log for a coffin.
It's better to do it early.
This will make a nice one.
You're a good boy.
But it's closed.
Come some other day.
All right, we're leaving now.
See you.
Bye for now.
There's a lot of cops.
He won't get far.
We'll deal with him back in town.
Let's go.
Admiral, it's all clear.
Dragon said it's the log without a red cloth.
Find it.
I'm sorry!
What are you doing?
What?
Wasn't Captain Chi going to sell the rifles to the pirates?
No, he was collecting them for the government.
It's Fei.
Womaniser!
If it wasn't for you, they would never have found the guns.
How did you know the rifles were there?
How did I know?
I eavesdropped!
But they discovered me.
What happened then?
I was surrounded by 20 thugs.
No other man can compete with me.
So...
I jumped on one and kicked three!
There was only one fat guy left.
What a fight we had!
We were fighting for three minutes, until I used this move.
Then he was defeated.
Then I told him if the pirates got those rifles, many kids would be killed.
That's right.
He decided to tell me where the rifles were hidden.
Dragon, I think you're wonderful.
Traitor!
So the price for betrayal is one little kiss?
And nothing else!
Look...
I'll deal with you later.
Have you seen a fat guy?
A fat guy?
He's gone that way.
Don't expect me to thank you.
You!
I just heard his voice.
He's right there.
Many thanks.
Don't block my way.
Why are you chasing me?
Ask him where he's put the guns.
Dragon.
Let's go!
Get him.
Come on.
Where are the guns?
Ask him.
Talk!
They're in the police station.
What?
!
Do you know how to handle that thing?
You conned me!
I thought you were a friend.
Double-crosser!
I was doing it for you.
How many times have I saved you?
Never.
Liar.
What about that axeman?
Who saved you then?
I don't remember that!
Bastard!
I'll teach you a lesson!
Let's go.
Come on.
This way.
Hurry, follow me.
There!
Cut them off.
Wait!
Where's Winnie?
How do I know?
If you get away, we'll meet at the usual place.
I can't walk.
Hold on.
They went that way.
Go on, jump.
It's not so high.
I'll go first.
Jump, go on!
Impossible!
Don't be scared.
I'll catch you.
If you don't jump, you'll end up a gangster's moll.
Come on.
Hide in there.
Stop.
Come on.
My leg hurts!
You'll be all right.
Quick.
Quick.
Watch out!
Run for it.
I'm up here!
Give me your hand.
Come on, run.
Just follow me.
It's easy, you see.
See?
Come on.
I'm still up here.
You'll send me mad!
Can't you even jump?
Come here.
Go on, slide down.
I'm...
You're scared.
Come on.
Get them.
Hide in here.
What now?
Take your clothes off.
Why?
!
Will you just do as I say?
What do you think you're doing?
!
This is a dead end.
We'll split up.
I got you.
My God!
Who dares to do that?
!
He'll get six months for this!
Sorry, sir.
It was you!
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
But you're in trouble.
No.
I'm all right.
See you around.
I got caught in your handcuffs.
You're arrested.
Deserting the force!
You'll be hung.
I'll go to the police station myself.
Can you let me go?
No way.
I'm short of officers at the moment.
We're looking for the missing...
They're found.
Really?
Tell me, have you got them?
I mean I've found the missing girls.
Girls again.
What else do you know about?
Come on.
Can we go the other way?
You're arrested and handcuffed, you'll have to follow me.
I know this type of handcuff inside out.
I can get my hands out of them just like this.
Can I borrow your bicycle?
Stop him!
Stop whistling!
Don't waste your breath.
Free me.
Get out of the way.
What's going on?
Who is it?
Crazy fool!
Out of the way.
There he is.
There!
Are you all right?
Don't worry about me, after him.
Keep clear!
Watch out!
Keep clear.
He'll be OK.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Use the brakes, you idiot.
It doesn't have any.
That's another one you owe me.
You should...
Out of the way.
Give me your hand.
Are you leaving Fei here?
He's a good-for-nothing.
Let's go.
Running out on me!
Where else can you find such a good friend?
You lied to me.
Do you want to fight?
If you want.
Save it till later.
Let's take care of this first.
No?
How about this?
Enough?
No?
Not enough?
OK.
Let's go.
They have guns.
Keep your head.
But the bullets will blow it off.
Now, you can't get out of this one.
We've got help.
Captain Chi.
What a surprise!
Fancy seeing you after all this time.
Get him!
Stealing government property, insulting a superior.
What's more, I caused serious injuries to some people.
Arrest me.
Handcuff this lunatic.
Hurry.
There's been a serious road accident.
I caused it!
It was me.
Go and see if anyone's injured.
Come on.
Winnie.
Hey, Winnie?
Look at the state you're in.
Go home at once.
Go home now!
Go on.
See you, Dragon.
Fei.
I've got to go now.
Bye.
You, fatty, your face looks familiar.
But I don't believe we've met.
That voice sounds familiar, too.
I'm known as the crazy guy!
Is that familiar, too?
Mind your manners, young man.
I'm not committing a crime.
Remember, we've a score to settle.
That voice really sounds familiar.
Thanks for giving me that life belt.
Don't mention...
He's the thief!
Stop him!
Captain, please!
Stop that man.
Yes, sir.
That ex-cop's got our rifles.
This type of cuff you know too well!
You won't do that again.
Come back.
Don't leave me here.
Captain, take me to the station!
Lock me up in prison.
I'm the sex maniac...
Don't shoot.
Too many people.
You double-crossed us.
Who are you?
Where are the guns?
Come on!
Where are my rifles?
Talk!
Where are the rifles?
Talk!
Hang on!
Hold tight.
Help's on the way.
I'll fetch some mattresses.
Don't bother.
He's going to fall.
Dragon!
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I've proved one thing at least.
What?
There is such a thing as gravity.
Take them back to the station.
Yes, sir.
9 junks ahead, Captain.
No need to worry about it sir.
These junks should be harmless.
But there's pirates in the water, you'd better be on your guard.
Yes, sir.
The rear admiral is on his way here to capture the pirates.
But the pirates have captured him instead.
What should I do now?
I suggest we get some policemen to go out and blockade the water.
Stop the sea traffic.
But that would be crazy.
We are in the shipping business.
If you blockade these waters,
San-po may still escape and we shippers will be put out of business.
Apart from blockading the water, do you have any other ideas?
Don't forget the pirates have the rear admiral.
He's our first priority.
Should anything happen to him,
I'd be sent home.
But this is your home!
Doesn't matter where my home is, we must save the admiral's life.
We have to come up with a good plan.
Sit down, Mr Chou.
Thank you.
Please carry on, but I have to meet someone.
Excuse me.
What the pirates want is money, and I can use the security fund.
But I need a middleman.
I've noticed your company's ships have never been robbed by them.
So I think you'll be the best candidate.
Do you see what I mean?
That's straight talking.
I'm always willing to work for the government.
But some of my men have been arrested...
I'll order the captain to release them.
I've always admired people who get knighted.
I can arrange something for you, as well.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
In order to sail my ships safely,
I have some contact with the pirates.
But this time, I'll go personally to see San-po.
I'll need 100 rifles to give him as a present.
If the rifles can save the admiral, I'll think about it.
Let me know as soon as possible.
Thanks for your time.
Bye now.
You'll hear from me soon.
Good day.
Good day.
This way.
Who are you?
A coast guard, Sergeant Ma.
I did once belong to the coast guard, sir.
What are you doing here?
The pirates have the admiral.
I thought you'd need us again.
I was expecting some good news.
But I overheard you making deals with that scum Chou.
You don't understand.
I'm doing this to save the admiral's life.
You're more concerned with your career.
Think of all those who have been captured.
There was no ransom for them.
Shut up.
You shut up.
The security fund is intended to free our seas.
It was donated to safeguard our shores.
You're abusing your position to further your career!
You're letting the Hong Kong people down.
You won't arrest the one who does business with the pirates, but you are willing to see the scum knighted.
Does the queen pay you to do that?
You know tigers are carnivores and now you're feeding them.
As soon as San-po gets those rifles, how many more men will be killed?
You spend your money on antiques.
How about all the wives waiting for husbands they'll never see again?
How about the orphans?
Do you think I don't want to destroy them?
Do you think I'm a coward?
The Royal Navy is too far away.
What can I fight the pirates with?
We can't beat them with guns, how about brains?
If we use the right strategy, we can destroy San-po and save the hostages.
Do you have anything in mind?
No!
No...
I have to think.
But I won't give up now.
Let's think about it.
You're in charge of the rescue now.
I need a good idea.
I can do it my way, sir?
Get to work.
Yes, sir.
Take care.
Yes, sir.
Thank you for the donation.
Bye now.
Bye.
Father, the coast guard's flag.
Attention.
Project A shall proceed as planned.
Help me!
Come here, you!
Get rid of him.
Get out of here.
You are safe now.
Thank you, Mr Chou.
You know my name?
Everybody knows you here.
Perhaps I can give you a lift.
I was going to get some noodles.
Let me.
Driver.
Go and get some noodles.
Yes, sir.
The night is rather cold.
Let's wait inside.
She's pretty.
I must admit I didn't realise that you were such a gentlemen.
That depends.
If she's a pretty young thing like you...
I think good manners are important.
Come on, quick!
What's wrong?
The coach was shaking.
I...
What are you doing?
You don't need to worry about me!
Close the door.
Yes, sir.
What was the matter with you?
Shut up.
Take over, I need a leak.
Yeah, hurry.
They're really having fun!
Quick!
That feels better.
Come on.
Easy, don't get carried away.
I'm not a cop now.
I can do anything.
We're fighting the pirates and you're on their side!
You bastard!
Easy!
Leave me alone!
How can I write my report if you kill him?
If you beat him up like that, he's going to die.
So what?
We can pretend he died trying to escape.
Tzu, please don't let him kill me.
If you want to live, tell us how you contact the pirates.
You're wasting time with scum like that.
Turn away.
Don't kill me.
I'll tell you everything.
What if you lie?
He wouldn't dare.
He knows he would die.
How do you contact them?
Talk!
On the 2nd of every month,
San-po's boat docks at the west pier.
There will be three strings of firecrackers hanging from the sail.
Going across?
Are you going to the fireworks shop?
What do you want from there?
Fireworks.
How do you light them?
With three sticks of incense.
And which stick goes first?
I'll use them all together.
Give me your name.
Are you a fortune teller?
I want to use your boat.
Are you taking me across?
The password's right.
Please come aboard.
These are presents for your boss.
My men will take care of them.
Let's go and wait for his news.
Set sail.
I'll get drunk in there.
What are you doing?
And what are you doing?
I'm on a mission to San-po's hideout.
Me, too.
You can't go.
It's too dangerous!
OK, I'll tell them to turn back.
Easy.
You'd better hide again.
Not in there.
I can't stand it any more.
Hide down there.
We're nearly there.
I want to save the hostages and possibly capture all the pirates.
Best of luck!
But count me out.
Just keep out of my sight.
Don't worry.
While you play the hero,
I'll get a little ready cash.
It's a deal.
Tell the chief they're here.
Go over there.
Help unload the ship.
Come on.
This way.
Sir, this way.
Chou Wing-ling.
Lord of the sea.
I'm the devil of the sea, but suddenly I've become lord of the sea.
Mr Chou, I am impressed by you.
Likewise, Lord of the sea...
You can call me San.
Uncle San.
I'm only 35!
This life puts years on you I guess.
San-po.
Brother.
Without a doubt, you're a smart guy.
You've been looking after my ships.
Many thanks for that.
It's tough.
Not much fun, more a matter of life and death.
So when you send me gifts,
I do prefer it to piracy.
Quick.
Put them down here.
I brought the rifles you asked for.
The wine is for your men.
I heard it wasn't easy to get them.
It's my fault that Cho-kou got...
I won't blame anyone for that.
I hope you can soon forget about it.
Boss, they're good.
That's the reason Mr Chou delivered them personally.
Actually, the Hong Kong governor sent me.
What do you mean?
He's the boss in Hong Kong...
And have you come here to arrest me and my men?
You must be joking!
That British ship you've got, the governor would like the release of the prisoners.
You keep the rifles as a present.
So the governor is not all bad.
I'll keep the rifles and the hostages.
If you release the prisoners,
I can talk to the governor more easily.
Don't bother.
San-po...
Mr Chou, I'm 35 today.
I'm having a birthday banquet and you must come.
Sure!
About the...
Just forget about it.
But...
Show him his room for the night.
Come this way.
Mr Chou.
There are dangerous paths and all kinds of snakes here.
So you'd better stay in your room.
Thank you for the warning.
Get those rifles stored away.
Yes.
This way.
Where are these going?
The storeroom.
Are there any precious items there?
Just fish and dried vegetables.
Precious items are in the treasury.
These rifles will easily get rusty there.
You're right.
They'd better go to the treasury.
Lead the way.
Don't you know the way?
I'm new here.
I've not been there before.
So, you don't know me?
No!
What's your name?
Don't ask my name.
Take them to the storeroom.
But you said the rifles would get rusty in there.
They can be polished, right?
Hurry.
There's lots of wine at the party.
Yeah, I know!
It's the right place.
Let's climb the hill.
Grub's up.
Okay.
You wait here,
I'll go and find Dragon.
Save us some wine.
Come on, we're on duty now.
What's the password?
They only gave me hand signals.
What do you mean?
This.
Don't move.
The password.
A dummy borrows a trumpet from a lama.
The lama doesn't understand the dummy.
He gives the dummy a pumpkin.
The dummy tries to signal a trumpet.
The lama gives him a gourd.
The dummy gets mad.
He swears at the lama.
Meaning what?
It's the password.
I'll ask him first this time.
Password.
Beat me up.
You can go now.
How could I have guessed right?
!
What's the password?
Beat me up.
Sure.
What kind of password is that?
It's me.
Dragon, it's you!
Where are they?
Over there.
Dragon's here.
Where's Tzu?
He went to look for you.
That must have been him.
Big Mouth, come with me.
The rest wait here.
Why did he hit me?
Maybe it's not the password.
What's the password?
The stars are out tonight.
Go round that way.
The password?
The stars are out tonight.
No, that's not it.
Wrong again?
It's Tzu!
Where did you get that hat?
Come on, get up.
Row, row.
Row the boat.
Row the boat quickly.
I'll row the boat to grandma's home.
Be smart and don't blow the plan.
Mr Chou, what are you doing here?
I'd like to show you this.
Bring them out at the exact time.
I...
Forget it.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You're late, drink this.
To San-po, may your victories continue.
Come along, sit.
Brother, I've been thinking.
If I keep the English, they'll eat lots of food.
You better take them.
Thank you.
Cheers, Brother.
Move.
Before the English women go, they should dance for us.
Guards!
They've been locked up for so long
I don't think they'd be up to it.
How about this?
Listen up.
Whoever beats San-po at arm wrestling will have this gold watch.
San-po, can you do it?
Sure.
Watch the champion!
Who's the first man?
Go on!
Are you all right, Cho-kou?
Fine.
Is the boss inside?
Yes.
Cho-kou!
Time to get out of here.
Dragon's in trouble now.
I'll have to help him again.
Quickly.
It's Fei!
Is that you, Fei?
Dragon's back there.
We have to get him out or he'll be dead.
Why?
Cho-kou just arrived.
What can we do?
Listen.
We either let Dragon die or we all die together.
We split up into two groups,
Big Mouth come with me.
Tai-po, get the hostages to a boat.
Then blow up the pirates' ships.
Then leave.
What about you?
If we don't make it, don't wait.
Tai-po, I guess this is serious.
Should I die, you must tell everyone why I sacrificed my life.
Big Mouth.
I envy your opportunity to become a hero.
Why not change places?
You go back and rescue Dragon.
No, please.
We'll stick to the plan.
Be careful!
Do you know where the rifles are?
Sure.
Here, Tzu.
This is for you.
What do I need a hammer for?
Get moving!
Boss.
Cho-kou.
Cho-kou.
Cho-kou.
Boss.
Great to see you back!
Happy birthday, boss.
Good.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
Mr Chou.
Mr Chou, boss wants you.
Which Mr Chou?
The one who sold us guns.
Mr Chou is here?
You!
I'm really sorry.
No!
I was saying...
I couldn't help you.
You're...
No one can rely upon me now.
We're all on the same side.
He's...
What's he done that's so bad?
He has a right to be mad at me.
Don't blame him.
Boss...
I shouldn't have come.
But I had to deliver the rifles, what could I do?
You dare to...
Dare to be here.
You can beat me or shoot me.
You...
You can kill me right here.
You're not Chou.
I'm not the Chou you once knew.
Boss, he's not Chou!
Come on...
He has a point there.
I'm not fit to be called Mr Chou.
I couldn't help him.
I'm no good.
I let my friend down.
Mr Chou...
I don't want to be called Mr Chou, it's too depressing.
See?
You've really upset him.
San-po, I'm going.
Mr Chou, please stay.
Thanks, San-po.
I shouldn't have come here.
Boss!
Bad news.
What's wrong?
The cops are here.
We can't hold the fort.
Let's go and kill them all.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Why are you here?
I'd be rich now if it wasn't for you!
How do the cops know where we are?
You led the cops here!
I wonder why you're out of jail.
Boss, that's bullshit.
Hands up!
I see you've brought Sergeant Ma, too.
Who is he?
He's a sergeant in the coast guard.
Cho-kou, thanks a lot.
Now the pirates are finished.
Boss!
Why don't you all give up now?
You're surrounded by the police.
No chance.
You don't have that many men.
I saw it!
They're all over the place.
Even in the water!
Don't exaggerate.
It's serious, believe me.
Cho-kou, you disappoint me.
You won't listen now.
Only death can prove my innocence.
Dragon's safe now, but we're not.
We've got to get out of here.
How?
We're going to blow up your ships.
Boss, did you hear what he said?
Not my ship!
No!
Now!
Get them!
Blow up all the entrances.
Mr Chou, I'll see to him.
Watch this!
I'm coming.
You're not Chou.
I never said I was.
I'll handle it.
Let's go.
Don't!
You'll blow us up!
Run for it.
Come back!
Why are you blowing us all up?
I've got to blow up the entrances to stop help coming.
Go and help Dragon finish off San-po.
Get them.
Are you running away?
Will you miss me?
!
Are you all right?
I missed you, friend.
San-po, the game's up.
Give up now.
I will fight until I'm dead.
Are you trying to kill me?
!
Put it back in!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
All the entrances are blocked, how do we get out?
I still have a grenade left.
Let's go.
Raise the sail.
Fast around to the west by 18.
How far to land?
About 126 feet.
If we're that near, then why can't we see it?
It's underneath us.
Look at the sun.
Left is south, right is north.
I thought the sun rose in the east.
Is that right?
Wrong direction, turn around.
So we've been going the wrong way for three days?
Don't blame me.
The sun only just came out.
At least we know it's wrong now.
Big Mouth, test the wind.
Sail with the wind!
Bring her round.
Look!
The sun is going down.
It's not rising.
It's the wrong direction again!
Bring her round.
Here we go again!
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. and the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis lan.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
...is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
lmmediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis lan.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
Your recent operations have been failures.
I have doubts about your present proposal.
Yes. sir.
Governor, in my opinion, these sea battles are risky.
Why not save all this precious money and spend it on the police?
We can capture the pirates this time.
According to your records, this is what happened two years ago.
You couldn't even find where the pirates were.
And with the wind two ships were lost.
A sudden typhoon came!
How do you explain last year?
You were so certain that you could capture the pirates, but you got lost in the sea and ended up in Bangladesh.
You were almost starved to death.
Can you explain that?
I was never good at geography.
You've wasted most of the budget.
We've not had a pay rise for two years because of this.
Do you know that my officers are complaining?
That's your problem, it's not mine.
You'd better think again.
I'm against taking unnecessary risks.
And so am I.
All right, if you're confident it'll work, then go ahead.
Dragon!
You're wanted immediately.
Dragon!
Go get these papers signed.
Thanks.
Morning.
Are you in a hurry?
Morning, sir.
Captain Chi, please sign this.
All this ammunition, is it necessary?
Is this another world war?
We need that much to fight the pirates.
Aren't you aware that we have to deal with street crime?
OK, you take all the ammunition, we can still manage to do our jobs.
Corporal.
Yes, sir.
Tell our men to practise running.
No shooting at criminals, we'll run after them instead.
Yes, sir.
Does that satisfy you?
If you hit the target every time, a bullet can kill one pirate, and a cannonball can kill a few dozen pirates.
Then you won't need so much ammunition.
Captain Chi, if you don't want to give it to me, just say so.
How dare you talk to your superior like that?
!
Look at yourself.
You coast guards can't even stand correctly.
You've been at sea for too long.
Do they ever teach you what discipline is?
You may go now.
Once I sign this, I'll give it to the armoury department.
Wait a second!
Lucky for you you're not in my department.
Dismiss.
Yes, sir.
Are you writing to your mum?
Tell her not to worry, we'll be back real soon.
Don't forget your life jacket.
I'll sleep in it.
Why are you all so sad?
Grin and bear it!
You all look so gloomy!
We're not dead yet.
The cops are watching us.
Show some spirit, can't you?
Dragon.
Is everybody here?
Are we leaving?
Sure.
We're sailing tomorrow night.
Why have you got such long faces?
Waiter, beer for everyone!
Thank you, sir.
It's very busy tonight.
Tzu, over here.
Beer for everyone.
You're late.
Sit down here.
This is my girlfriend
- Chu.
Waiter, here.
Waiter, get us some beer.
Beer.
Who keeps the sea safe?
The coast guard!
Who's the toughest?
Coast guard!
It's them again.
Drink to the greatest!
Don't your customers get served?
They're going to die.
Don't be like that.
What did you say?
You're going to die!
Forget it.
I'm coming.
Hurry.
Your order, please?
Beer.
Four beers.
May I join in?
Winnie.
Sit down.
Are they celebrating something?
They're celebrating going to capture the pirates.
They may not come back.
A glass of milk, OK?
Not milk.
I'll buy you a beer.
All right, then.
No wonder we don't get a pay rise.
These bums waste good money chasing after pirates.
Actually, they couldn't even locate where the pirates were.
Come on, don't get upset.
Even now, they have no idea where the pirates are.
Say that again!
No trouble.
Stay calm.
Tai-po, get the check.
Get the check.
Sha, taking a vacation soon?
That's right.
Are you going home?
To Canton.
The sea's full of pirates, don't take a boat.
How can he get there, then?
He can always walk.
Do you feel safe walking on the road?
Mind your own business.
Ladies and gentlemen, we admit the sea is not safe now and we apologise.
My uncle is coming to Hong Kong and he's walking all the way from Canton.
But he's blind, how can he manage it?
But his ears are very good.
When he hears someone selling cookies...
He's reached Yuen Long!
When he can smell roast goose...
He's in Shen Jang!
And when he can hear whistles?
Whistles.
He's in Hong Kong Island!
That's right.
Even children know this song.
One, two, three, four, A, B, C, D
The cops whistle when the criminals run away
Whistle...
The cops whistle when the criminals run away
Whistle...
Bastard!
The cops whistle when the criminals...
Easy!
No fighting!
Stop it.
Stop fighting.
Do you hear me?
Stop it.
Come on.
Can nobody take a joke today?
We're sorry.
Let's toast to friendship.
Let's not fight each other.
Why are you so rude?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Let's go.
I'm OK.
I spilt some beer.
but I've made my toast so no matter.
Let's go.
You dirtied my best suit.
I apologise.
But I don't forgive you.
You have two choices, pal.
You can say you are sorry or...
I won't say sorry.
I choose the second one.
We're all friends, aren't we?
Not any more.
I'll give him a mouthful.
Where is he?
What are they doing?
The cops are fighting with the coast guards.
Stop fighting.
Stop this at once.
Police!
We're all for law and order here!
I'm going to get you.
I'll get back to you later.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
Why did you hit me?
!
I'll get him, be sure of that!
221!
I've got your number.
I'll give you all this spaghetti!
221!
I'm here.
What is it?
Nothing.
Stop fighting.
You are supposed to represent law and order.
Arrest them.
Yes, sir.
Uncle.
Come on, get up.
Get yourself out of here.
You know we're sailing tomorrow, you really can't detain my men.
Only some are detained.
You have all my navigators locked up.
Just because you don't want us to sail.
I informed the governor.
I suppose you informed him your nephew started it.
Attention.
Can you let them go now?
My thanks to the captain.
All right.
I want no more trouble.
Father.
Go home.
Admiral, sir.
Sorry about the trouble we caused.
Don't apologise.
If I was in your position,
I'd beat them to hell.
I never could stand the smell of cops.
Get out of here!
Fall in.
Attention.
Left, left right left
Left, left right left...
Present arms.
Left and right turn.
Present arms.
Order arms.
Our mission is to capture those pirates.
Yes, sir.
When you see them, what should you do?
We will never let them go.
What if you are wounded?
We won't feel the pain.
And when you're captured?
Well?
What is it then?
Guard, come here.
Talk...
Talk or you'll be shot dead.
Good.
Keep silent if you're captured.
Dismiss.
Ready for inspection.
Listen up, boys.
If you can fight the pirates like you fought the police, then you're sure to win.
We're sure to win.
We built five ships, why are there only three?
Governor, the other two are submerged.
I thought we couldn't see them because they were submarines!
Three ships will be too crowded.
They may be overcrowded, but it shouldn't be a problem.
They won't be crowded when returning.
Ready.
Attention.
Right turn.
March.
Put the fire out.
Two ships are on fire.
Then get water.
Get water!
I'll arrange for a ship to take you to Vietnam.
Don't worry about it, I know what to do.
Excuse me, I have some business now.
Chiang, the cops are looking for you.
You keep out of trouble.
Thanks to your information, we've blown up their ships.
They're better off this way.
If you had blown them up at sea, they would have had to swim home.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
All my ships travel safely now thanks to San-po's protection.
I should really thank him.
I'm happy to hear you say that.
San-po would like a favour from you.
He needs 100 rifles like this.
I'll see you get paid well for it.
Sure, I know what to do.
Cho-kou... it won't be a problem.
We're counting on you.
Bye now.
Take care.
But Boss, those are police rifles.
Where can we get that many?
It'll be tough, but we'll manage it.
We need a good man for the job.
What about Chiang?
No.
He's a wanted man now.
Contact Fei.
Are you sure?
He's expensive.
Don't worry about it.
We can always kill him afterwards.
West.
Full house.
On what?
On a West.
Where did you get that?
!
You're blind.
He threw away a Circle.
The West was discarded ages ago.
Now what?
you should be fined.
Pay the fine.
Pay up.
I'm finished.
Fine.
we need one more player.
I'll join you...
Banker.
Price it.
Fei, I'll make it quick.
Can you take a look at this?
A broken rusty watch.
Three dollars.
It's Fei's watch.
You can be sure it's real gold. 100 dollars.
Not this one.
Forty Thousand.
Wait.
It's time we saw the colour of your money.
Place your bets.
Today is my day.
Nothing I can do.
Can't you be more careful?
Eight Circles.
Hold on.
What are you doing?
Sorry, Fei.
Your turn.
Six Sticks.
You're not going to win this game.
Twenty Thousand thrown away.
No.
Honestly.
Are you accusing me of being blind?
Am I right?
He discarded Five Circles.
Right?
No.
Will you swear to it?
Sure.
I will swear to it.
Everybody, on my life I swear I've just discarded Five Circles.
I didn't throw away Twnety Thousand.
Five Circles?
That's right.
Let's see.
I won!
I won this game.
You are good.
Thank you.
Come on, give me my money.
That's it.
Hold it!
I saw you cheating.
I saw you cheating.
Sorry.
Don't worry.
It's my turn now.
Get up.
Please, no!
It's my turn now.
What's the hurry?
Maybe I can win again.
It's a full house.
Nobody can argue with this.
Hello Fei.
We want a favour from you.
Do you know how much money I was going to win?
This is my new plan for capturing the pirates.
It's called Project A.
First of all, we need to buy new ships.
Go home and get some rest.
I'm not in the least bit tired.
Secondly, we need more new recruits.
Let me tell you, your men have disappointed me a lot.
I'm turning them over to Captain Chi for some hard training.
Now you're in charge of fundraising.
A British ship has been sent to capture the pirates.
I want you to get out now!
Change into these uniforms.
Why?
Captain Chi's orders.
These are police uniforms.
Are you kidding?
The governor disbanded our squad.
I don't care what I wear as long as I still get paid.
It's better than fighting the pirates.
Congratulations.
Congratulations on your new status.
Now you don't need to endure the hardship of the sea.
And you, sir?
Me?
Didn't you hear about my promotion to chairman of fundraising?
What exactly is that?
Go change your uniforms.
Come on.
Attention.
Change uniforms at once.
That's my last order.
I think it's time to report in.
Go on.
Reporting for duty, Captain Chi.
From the coast guards.
Sergeant Ma?
We've been disbanded, sir.
Shut up.
I don't care what you did in the coast guards, you're in the police now.
When you answer an officer in this force, answer yes or no.
Just look at you.
Attention.
You call that attention?
I'll teach you how to stand.
Stand to attention.
Stand up, chest out, stomach in.
From the nose to the toes, there's a straight line.
Is your number 213?
Answer me.
Yes, sir.
Do you think you're stupid?
Answer me!
No, sir.
Not bad at all.
Captain Chi.
Just in time.
Meet Sergeant Ma.
This our new inspector, Hong Tin-tzu.
Inspector Hong is an excellent officer.
He'll be your squad leader and train you to be a Special Mission squad.
You may leave.
Dismiss.
Sergeant.
For the last time, what is the correct salute?
Yes, sir.
We're in trouble.
Start training them tomorrow.
If you want them to listen to you, be sure to give them a hard time.
Yes, sir.
Come on, fall in.
Attention.
Salute.
You, come here.
Salute, Private.
Stand up, chest out, stomach in.
Do it 500 times.
Yes, sir.
I don't care how sloppy you were before, you're in the police now.
As a policeman you have to be fit...
Look at that chick over there.
She's got a crazy figure!
She's a bit of all right.
209 and 214, come out here,
What were you talking about?
He said look at that chick.
He said she had a crazy figure.
He said she's gorgeous.
Go repeat it 500 times.
1000!
Yes, sir.
Look at that chick over there.
She's got a crazy figure.
Look at that chick over there...
She's got a crazy figure.
Who was laughing?
It was me, sir.
Here.
Laughing on parade.
Yes, sir.
Were you the only one laughing?
Yes, sir.
Do you know the punishment for it?
To laugh 1,000 times.
Shoot him dead.
Look at that chick there.
She's got a crazy figure.
Attention.
About turn.
About turn.
About turn.
Double march.
Sir, we've finished.
Hefainted before the execution.
Then he can clean the toilets.
Look at that chick.
She's got a crazy figure.
Look at that chick.
She's got a crazy figure.
Look at that chick.
She's got a...
What's up?
That was some dream.
I hit Tzu really hard.
Let me sleep!
Why is there an emergency call now?
There must be an emergency.
Nonsense.
Put on your uniforms.
Quick.
Attention.
Salute.
You drank too much soup last night so you need the toilet now.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Take them to the toilets and then dismiss them.
Yes, sir.
Turn left.
Stand by.
Into attack.
Forward.
In our squad, speed is essential.
It's very simple.
You have ten seconds.
Stand by.
Ready.
Go.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
You must understand that I'm training you to be alert day and night.
OK, my turn.
Do you have ten seconds, too?
Instructors are allowed 45 seconds.
Give me a water ladle.
Give me one.
Hurry!
Give it to him.
That's an order.
We might have to use some deadly weapons on our missions.
This is the latest hand grenade.
You might not know it.
I will give a demonstration.
Pull the pin out and throw it within ten seconds.
Bang!
It's just exploded.
Got it, boys?
Yes, sir.
Big Mouth, get the grenade.
Yes, sir.
Did you switch them?
Yes, I did.
Sergeant, did I say you were outstanding?
No, sir.
Step back in line.
Let's take turns at throwing it.
Yes, sir.
Sir, he doesn't know how to use it.
Yes, I do.
Can you show us again, sir?
OK.
Watch carefully this time.
Firstly...
Do you think I'm stupid?
No.
But that's a real grenade.
Pull the pin.
This time I'll throw it towards you.
So watch out.
Quick!
It's a real grenade.
Look out!
Squad, sit down.
We've been given orders to arrest Chiang.
We've heard that he's hiding in the Hoover Club.
We've been given orders to go to the Hoover Club to arrest Chiang.
One problem is that important people use this club.
We must arrest Chiang discreetly and not disturb the members in the club.
Do you all understand?
Understood, sir.
I can't do it alone.
I'll let you know when I've made my mind up.
You better make it quick.
The quicker the better.
Don't cause a disturbance until we find Chiang.
We all know what to do.
You cover here.
Come on.
Membership cards, please.
Police.
Can I help?
That's not a membership card.
We suspect you're hiding an escaped criminal.
Wait there.
What's the matter?
This is a private club.
Our members are rich and famous.
You can't disturb our members.
If you don't understand, I can interpret that for you.
He said our members are rich and famous people.
There are no criminals here.
So, excuse me.
Front door's there.
Can't we come in for a drink?
No disrespect, but how much do you earn a month?
Even a glass might be worth more than your savings.
Stop!
I said stop.
Calm down.
He was trying to tip them off.
Lucky I didn't break any glasses.
Do you know who my boss is?
!
I don't need to know.
We want to have a look around.
Fine.
Take a look.
Leave when you've finished.
You've seen everything.
That's the manager's office.
It's the cops.
Chiang, coming out quietly?
All the bad guys are here.
That'll save me some work.
We're arresting you for murder and drug trafficking.
And for insulting a policeman.
This is the warrant.
You know the charges!
We've come for an arrest, not a fight.
Beat him up!
Don't be afarid.
We're police.
You can't go up.
Get lost!
You have to pay for all the damage here.
Do you understand?
Speak Chinese!
You have to pay for all the damage here.
Get him.
Keep out of sight.
Go on.
Look at this mess!
Stop it.
I said stop it.
Captain.
Do you have a warrant for this?
No.
Sergeant Ma.
We were informed the murderer Chiang was here.
So where is he?
Upstairs.
How dare you!
You're trespassing on my property.
Captain, your men should join a demolition squad.
Do you know what you're doing?
You are more experienced than Tzu, you should have known better.
Uncle...
That's enough.
Sergeant, apologise to Mr Chou.
To him?
But we did nothing wrong!
They're hiding criminals and have assaulted us.
Apologise?
!
Captain, I'll tell the governor that you allowed these men to slander me.
Come back.
You'll see if it's slander.
I said apologise to Mr Chou.
There's a punishment for disobeying an order.
So be it, then.
I quit.
I am no longer a policeman.
No more orders.
How dare you!
Stop him.
Everyone stay where you are.
You take the credit.
I'm always the bad guy.
Dragon.
You almost hit my nose!
How are you?
You don't treat friends like this.
It's not my fault if you have the hump.
Were you in the club?
When I saw you guys move in,
I knew something was in the air.
In this world of evils, no man stands alone.
I won't join your thieving ways!
Don't mention that word.
Since you joined the force, I've gone straight.
How else could we be seen together?
I guess some are delighted that you quit.
Why?
You want to get rid of the pirates, but not everyone is like you.
Really?
Yes.
Why did your ships get blown up?
Someone betrayed you all.
You're guessing.
I'm not.
The pirates are getting rifles from somebody inside your force.
News!
Read all about it.
Pirate San-po strikes again.
Three dead, 24 injured.
Read all about it.
Who'd sell to pirates?
Why do you want to know?
I want to know who would be so cold-blooded.
Thanks.
Why do you know so much?
Are you thinking of stealing them?
In life there are four kinds of people.
I don't qualify as a rich man.
I don't like being poor.
The cops don't want me so I have to be a thief.
As you're my friend, I'll try to be a good thief.
In this rifle deal, everyone is a bad guy.
You can get your man and I'll get my money.
And we both win.
Tell me where.
At the jetty.
Everything's in order?
Here's the rifles.
Thank you.
Get them on board.
OK.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The pier's moved!
Get him up here.
Quick!
Someone's there!
It's me.
Do you know you're committing a serious crime?
And selling arms to the pirates is a crime.
How shall we punish him?
Chop off his head.
Yes!
We'll chop his head off.
We're surrounded by water.
I can't find an axe.
So... we have to let them go.
We'll kick them in the water.
Why didn't you jump?
I can't swim.
Really?
I can't.
Now what?
What now?
Why can't you swim?
It's never too late to learn.
Give this to him.
Now swim and swim!
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Help!
I can't swim!
Let's go.
Help me!
Help me!
What will you do with them?
Find some buyers, of course.
Yeah, they'll make good money.
You're not going to sell them to just anybody, are you?
These are guns, not toys.
Don't worry.
I'll sell them back to the army.
Are you happy now?
Then I'm glad I helped you.
What's that for?
We have to identify which log it is.
Remember, it's only you and I in on this.
Have you finished, Fei?
This way.
Have you got the money?
Here.
And the rifles?
I wouldn't keep rifles here.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Now, where are the rifles?
They're in the log yard.
I'll take you there in the morning.
There's so many.
Which one is it?
Easy.
I fixed a red cloth on it.
Right there, see?
They all have a red cloth.
Which one?
What now, Fei?
Which one is it?
Looks like we'll have to turn them all over.
OK, guys, get started.
Listen.
Fei, be smart with us.
We can get rough.
Mind your manners.
You guys get soft living the high life.
You double-crossed us.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Tell us right now or we'll kill you.
Everyone leave.
This place is closed to the public today.
Come on, split.
You sold us out to the cops.
It's not my day.
Why are you still here?
I'm an undertaker.
His father is going to die and he's looking for a nice log for a coffin.
It's better to do it early.
This will make a nice one.
You're a good boy.
But it's closed.
Come some other day.
All right, we're leaving now.
See you.
Bye for now.
There's a lot of cops.
He won't get far.
We'll deal with him back in town.
Let's go.
Admiral, it's all clear.
Dragon said it's the log without a red cloth.
Find it.
I'm sorry!
What are you doing?
What?
Wasn't Captain Chi going to sell the rifles to the pirates?
No, he was collecting them for the government.
It's Fei.
Womaniser!
If it wasn't for you, they would never have found the guns.
How did you know the rifles were there?
How did I know?
I eavesdropped!
But they discovered me.
What happened then?
I was surrounded by 20 thugs.
No other man can compete with me.
So...
I jumped on one and kicked three!
There was only one fat guy left.
What a fight we had!
We were fighting for three minutes, until I used this move.
Then he was defeated.
Then I told him if the pirates got those rifles, many kids would be killed.
That's right.
He decided to tell me where the rifles were hidden.
Dragon, I think you're wonderful.
Traitor!
So the price for betrayal is one little kiss?
And nothing else!
Look...
I'll deal with you later.
Have you seen a fat guy?
A fat guy?
He's gone that way.
Don't expect me to thank you.
You!
I just heard his voice.
He's right there.
Many thanks.
Don't block my way.
Why are you chasing me?
Ask him where he's put the guns.
Dragon.
Let's go!
Get him.
Come on.
Where are the guns?
Ask him.
Talk!
They're in the police station.
What?
!
Do you know how to handle that thing?
You conned me!
I thought you were a friend.
Double-crosser!
I was doing it for you.
How many times have I saved you?
Never.
Liar.
What about that axeman?
Who saved you then?
I don't remember that!
Bastard!
I'll teach you a lesson!
Let's go.
Come on.
This way.
Hurry, follow me.
There!
Cut them off.
Wait!
Where's Winnie?
How do I know?
If you get away, we'll meet at the usual place.
I can't walk.
Hold on.
They went that way.
Go on, jump.
It's not so high.
I'll go first.
Jump, go on!
Impossible!
Don't be scared.
I'll catch you.
If you don't jump, you'll end up a gangster's moll.
Come on.
Hide in there.
Stop.
Come on.
My leg hurts!
You'll be all right.
Quick.
Quick.
Watch out!
Run for it.
I'm up here!
Give me your hand.
Come on, run.
Just follow me.
It's easy, you see.
See?
Come on.
I'm still up here.
You'll send me mad!
Can't you even jump?
Come here.
Go on, slide down.
I'm...
You're scared.
Come on.
Get them.
Hide in here.
What now?
Take your clothes off.
Why?
!
Will you just do as I say?
What do you think you're doing?
!
This is a dead end.
We'll split up.
I got you.
My God!
Who dares to do that?
!
He'll get six months for this!
Sorry, sir.
It was you!
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
But you're in trouble.
No.
I'm all right.
See you around.
I got caught in your handcuffs.
You're arrested.
Deserting the force!
You'll be hung.
I'll go to the police station myself.
Can you let me go?
No way.
I'm short of officers at the moment.
We're looking for the missing...
They're found.
Really?
Tell me, have you got them?
I mean I've found the missing girls.
Girls again.
What else do you know about?
Come on.
Can we go the other way?
You're arrested and handcuffed, you'll have to follow me.
I know this type of handcuff inside out.
I can get my hands out of them just like this.
Can I borrow your bicycle?
Stop him!
Stop whistling!
Don't waste your breath.
Free me.
Get out of the way.
What's going on?
Who is it?
Crazy fool!
Out of the way.
There he is.
There!
Are you all right?
Don't worry about me, after him.
Keep clear!
Watch out!
Keep clear.
He'll be OK.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Use the brakes, you idiot.
It doesn't have any.
That's another one you owe me.
You should...
Out of the way.
Give me your hand.
Are you leaving Fei here?
He's a good-for-nothing.
Let's go.
Running out on me!
Where else can you find such a good friend?
You lied to me.
Do you want to fight?
If you want.
Save it till later.
Let's take care of this first.
No?
How about this?
Enough?
No?
Not enough?
OK.
Let's go.
They have guns.
Keep your head.
But the bullets will blow it off.
Now, you can't get out of this one.
We've got help.
Captain Chi.
What a surprise!
Fancy seeing you after all this time.
Get him!
Stealing government property.
insulting a superior.
What's more, I caused serious injuries to some people.
Arrest me.
Handcuff this lunatic.
Hurry.
There's been a serious road accident.
I caused it!
It was me.
Go and see if anyone's injured.
Come on.
Winnie.
Hey, Winnie?
Look at the state you're in.
Go home at once.
Go home now!
Go on.
See you, Dragon.
Fei.
I've got to go now.
Bye.
You, fatty, your face looks familiar.
But I don't believe we've met.
That voice sounds familiar. too.
,
I'm known as the crazy guy!
Is that familiar too?
Mind your manners, young man.
I'm not committing a crime.
Remember, we've a score to settle.
That voice really sounds familiar.
Thanks for giving me that life belt.
Don't mention...
He's the thief!
Stop him!
Captain, please!
Stop that man.
Yes, sir.
That ex-cop's got our rifles.
This type of cuff you know too well!
You won't do that again.
Come back.
Don't leave me here.
Captain, take me to the station!
Lock me up in prison.
I'm the sex maniac...
Don't shoot.
Too many people.
You double-crossed us.
Who are you?
Where are the guns?
Come on!
Where are my rifles?
Talk!
Where are the rifles?
Talk!
Hang on!
Hold tight.
Help's on the way.
I'll fetch some mattresses.
Don't bother.
He's going to fall.
Dragon!
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I've proved one thing at least.
What?
There is such a thing as gravity.
Take them back to the station.
Yes, sir.
9 junks ahead, Captain.
No need to worry about it sir.
These junks should be harmless.
But there's pirates in the water.
you'd better be on your guard.
Yes, sir.
The rear admiral is on his way here to capture the pirates.
But the pirates have captured him instead.
What should I do now?
I suggest we get some policemen to go out and blockade the water.
Stop the sea traffic.
But that would be crazy.
We are in the shipping business.
If you blockade these waters,
San-po may still escape and we shippers will be put out of business.
Apart from blockading the water.
do you have any other ideas?
Don't forget the pirates have the rear admiral.
He's our first priority.
Should anything happen to him,
I'd be sent home.
But this is your home!
Doesn't matter where my home is, we must save the admiral's life.
We have to come up with a good plan.
Sit down Mr Chou.
Thank you.
Please carry on, but I have to meet someone.
Excuse me.
What the pirates want is money.
and I can use the security fund.
But I need a middleman.
I've noticed your company's ships have never been robbed by them.
So I think you'll be the best candidate.
Do you see what I mean?
That's straight talking.
I'm always willing to work for the government.
But some of my men have been arrested...
I'll order the captain to release them.
I've always admired people who get knighted.
I can arrange something for you, as well.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
In order to sail my ships safely.
I have some contact with the pirates.
But this time, I'll go personally to see San-po.
I'll need 100 rifles to give him as a present.
If the rifles can save the admiral, I'll think about it.
Let me know as soon as possible.
Thanks for your time.
Bye now.
You'll hear from me soon.
Good day.
Good day.
This way.
Who are you?
A coast guard, Sergeant Ma.
I did once belong to the coast guard, sir.
What are you doing here?
The pirates have the admiral.
I thought you'd need us again.
I was expecting some good news.
But I overheard you making deals with that scum Chou.
You don't understand.
I'm doing this to save the admiral's life.
You're more concerned with your career.
Think of all those who have been captured.
There was no ransom for them.
Shut up.
You shut up.
The security fund is intended to free our seas.
It was donated to safeguard our shores.
You're abusing your position to further your career!
You're letting the Hong Kong people down.
You won't arrest the one who does business with the pirates, but you are willing to see the scum knighted.
Does the queen pay you to do that?
You know tigers are carnivores and now you're feeding them.
As soon as San-po gets those rifles, how many more men will be killed?
You spend your money on antiques.
How about all the wives waiting for husbands they'll never see again?
How about the orphans?
Do you think I don't want to destroy them?
Do you think I'm a coward?
The Royal Navy is too far away.
What can I fight the pirates with?
We can't beat them with guns, how about brains?
If we use the right strategy.
we can destroy San-po and save the hostages.
Do you have anything in mind?
No!
No...
I have to think.
But I won't give up now.
Let's think about it.
You're in charge of the rescue now.
I need a good idea.
I can do it my way, sir?
Get to work.
Yes, sir.
Take care.
Yes, sir.
Thank you for the donation.
Bye now.
Bye.
Father, the coast guard's flag.
Attention.
Project A shall proceed as planned.
Help me!
Come here, you!
Get rid of him.
Get out of here.
You are safe now.
Thank you, Mr Chou.
You know my name?
Everybody knows you here.
Perhaps I can give you a lift.
I was going to get some noodles.
Let me.
Driver.
Go and get some noodles.
Yes, sir.
The night is rather cold.
Let's wait inside.
She's pretty.
I must admit I didn't realise that you were such a gentlemen.
That depends.
If she's a pretty young thing like you...
I think good manners are important.
Come on, quick!
What's wrong?
The coach was shaking.
I...
What are you doing?
You don't need to worry about me!
Close the door.
Yes, sir.
What was the matter with you?
Shut up.
Take over, I need a leak.
Yeah, hurry.
They're really having fun!
Quick!
That feels better.
Come on.
Easy, don't get carried away.
I'm not a cop now.
I can do anything.
We're fighting the pirates and you're on their side!
You bastard!
Easy!
Leave me alone!
How can I write my report if you kill him?
If you beat him up like that, he's going to die.
So what?
We can pretend he died trying to escape.
Tzu, please don't let him kill me.
If you want to live, tell us how you contact the pirates.
You're wasting time with scum like that.
Turn away.
Don't kill me.
I'll tell you everything.
What if you lie?
He wouldn't dare.
He knows he would die.
How do you contact them?
Talk!
On the 2nd of every month,
San-po's boat docks at the west pier.
There will be three strings of firecrackers hanging from the sail.
Going across?
Are you going to the fireworks shop?
What do you want from there?
Fireworks.
How do you light them?
With three sticks of incense.
And which stick goes first?
I'll use them all together.
Give me your name.
Are you a fortune teller?
I want to use your boat.
Are you taking me across?
The password's right.
Please come aboard.
These are presents for your boss.
My men will take care of them.
Let's go and wait for his news.
Set sail.
I'll get drunk in there.
What are you doing?
And what are you doing?
I'm on a mission to San-po's hideout.
Me too.
You can't go.
It's too dangerous!
OK.
I'll tell them to turn back.
Easy.
You'd better hide again.
Not in there.
I can't stand it any more.
Hide down there.
We're nearly there.
I want to save the hostages and possibly capture all the pirates.
Best of luck!
But count me out.
Just keep out of my sight.
Don't worry.
While you play the hero,
I'll get a little ready cash.
It's a deal.
Tell the chief they're here.
Go over there.
Help unload the ship.
Come on.
This way.
Sir, this way.
Chou Wing-ling.
Lord of the sea.
I'm the devil of the sea but suddenly I've become lord of the sea.
Mr Chou, I am impressed by you.
Likewise, Lord of the sea...
You can call me San.
Uncle San.
I'm only 35!
This life puts years on you I guess.
San-po.
Brother.
Without a doubt, you're a smart guy.
You've been looking after my ships.
Many thanks for that.
It's tough.
Not much fun, more a matter of life and death.
So when you send me gifts,
I do prefer it to piracy.
Quick.
Put them down here.
I brought the rifles you asked for.
The wine is for your men.
I heard it wasn't easy to get them.
It's my fault that Cho-kou got...
I won't blame anyone for that.
I hope you can soon forget about it.
Boss, they're good.
That's the reason Mr Chou delivered them personally.
Actually, the Hong Kong governor sent me.
What do you mean?
He's the boss in Hong Kong...
And have you come here to arrest me and my men?
You must be joking!
That British ship you've got, the governor would like the release of the prisoners.
You keep the rifles as a present.
So the governor is not all bad.
I'll keep the rifles and the hostages.
If you release the prisoners,
I can talk to the governor more easily.
Don't bother.
San-po...
Mr Chou, I'm 35 today.
I'm having a birthday banquet and you must come.
Sure!
About the...
Just forget about it.
But...
Show him his room for the night.
Come this way.
Mr Chou.
There are dangerous paths and all kinds of snakes here.
So you'd better stay in your room.
Thank you for the warning.
Get those rifles stored away.
Yes.
This way.
Where are these going?
The storeroom.
Are there any precious items there?
Just fish and dried vegetables.
Precious items are in the treasury.
These rifles will easily get rusty there.
You're right.
They'd better go to the treasury.
Lead the way.
Don't you know the way?
I'm new here.
I've not been there before.
So, you don't know me?
No!
What's your name?
Don't ask my name.
Take them to the storeroom.
But you said the rifles would get rusty in there.
They can be polished, right?
Hurry.
There's lots of wine at the party.
Yeah, I know!
It's the right place.
Let's climb the hill.
Grub's up.
Okay.
You wait here,
I'll go and find Dragon.
Save us some wine.
Come on, we're on duty now.
What's the password?
They only gave me hand signals.
What do you mean?
This.
Don't move.
The password.
A dummy borrows a trumpet from a lama.
The lama doesn't understand the dummy.
He gives the dummy a pumpkin.
The dummy tries to signal a trumpet.
The lama gives him a gourd.
The dummy gets mad.
Heswears at the lama.
Meaning what?
It's the password.
I'll ask him first this time.
Password.
Beat me up.
You can go now.
How could I have guessed right?
!
What's the password?
Beat me up.
Sure.
What kind of password is that?
It's me.
Dragon, it's you!
Where are they?
Over there.
Dragon's here.
Where's Tzu?
He went to look for you.
That must have been him.
Big Mouth, come with me.
The rest wait here.
Why did he hit me?
Maybe it's not the password.
What's the password?
The stars are out tonight.
Go round that way.
The password?
The stars are out tonight.
No, that's not it.
Wrong again?
It's Tzu!
Where did you get that hat?
Come on, get up.
Row, row.
Row the boat.
Row the boat quickly.
I'll row the boat to grandma's home.
Be smart and don't blow the plan.
Mr Chou, what are you doing here?
I'd like to show you this.
Bring them out at the exact time.
I...
Forget it.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You're late.
Drink this.
To San-po, may your victories continue.
Come along, sit.
Brother, I've been thinking.
If I keep the English, they'll eat lots of food.
You better take them.
Thank you.
Cheers, Brother.
Move.
Before the English women go, they should dance for us.
Guards!
They've been locked up for so long
I don't think they'd be up to it.
How about this?
Listen up.
Whoever beats San-po at arm wrestling will have this gold watch.
San-po, can you do it?
Sure.
Watch the champion!
Who's the first man?
Go on!
Are you all right, Cho-kou?
Fine.
Is the boss inside?
Yes.
Cho-kou!
Time to get out of here.
Dragon's in trouble now.
I'll have to help him again.
Quickly.
It's Fei!
Is that you, Fei?
Dragon's back there.
We have to get him out or he'll be dead.
Why?
Cho-kou just arrived.
What can we do?
Listen.
We either let Dragon die or we all die together.
We split up into two groups,
Big Mouth come with me.
Tai-po, get the hostages to a boat.
Then blow up the pirates' ships.
Then leave.
What about you?
If we don't make it, don't wait.
Tai-po, I guess this is serious.
Should I die, you must tell everyone why I sacrificed my life.
Big Mouth.
I envy your opportunity to become a hero.
Why not change places?
You go back and rescue Dragon.
No, please.
We'll stick to the plan.
Be careful!
Do you know where the rifles are?
Sure.
Here, Tzu.
This is for you.
What do I need a hammer for?
Get moving!
Boss.
Cho-kou.
Cho-kou.
Cho-kou.
Boss.
Great to see you back!
Happy birthday, boss.
Good.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
Mr Chou.
Mr Chou, boss wants you.
Which Mr Chou?
The one who sold us guns.
Mr Chou is here?
You!
I'm really sorry.
No!
I was saying...
I couldn't help you.
You're...
No one can rely upon me now.
We're all on the same side.
He's...
What's he done that's so bad?
He has a right to be mad at me.
Don't blame him.
Boss...
I shouldn't have come.
But I had to deliver the rifles, what could I do?
You dare to...
Dare to be here.
You can beat me or shoot me.
You...
You can kill me right here.
You're not Chou.
I'm not the Chou you once knew.
Boss, he's not Chou!
Come on...
He has a point there.
I'm not fit to be called Mr Chou.
I couldn't help him.
I'm no good.
I let my friend down.
Mr Chou...
I don't want to be called Mr Chou, it's too depressing.
See?
You've really upset him.
San-po, I'm going.
Mr Chou, please stay.
Thanks, San-po.
I shouldn't have come here.
Boss!
Bad news.
What's wrong?
The cops are here.
We can't hold the fort.
Let's go and kill them all.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Why are you here?
I'd be rich now if it wasn't for you!
How do the cops know where we are?
You led the cops here!
I wonder why you're out of jail.
Boss, that's bullshit.
Hands up!
I see you've brought Sergeant Ma, too.
Who is he?
He's a sergeant in the coast guard.
Cho-kou, thanks a lot.
Now the pirates are finished.
Boss!
Why don't you all give up now?
You're surrounded by the police.
No chance.
You don't have that many men.
I saw it!
They're all over the place.
Even in the water!
Don't exaggerate.
It's serious, believe me.
Cho-kou, you disappoint me.
You won't listen now.
Only death can prove my innocence.
Dragon's safe now, but we're not.
We've got to get out of here.
How?
We're going to blow up your ships.
Boss, did you hear what he said?
Not my ship!
No!
Now!
Get them!
Blow up all the entrances.
Mr Chou, I'll see to him.
Watch this!
I'm coming.
You're not Chou.
I never said I was.
I'll handle it.
Let's go.
Don't!
You'll blow us up!
Run for it.
Come back!
Why are you blowing us all up?
I've got to blow up the entrances to stop help coming.
Go and help Dragon finish off San-po.
Get them.
Are you running away?
Will you miss me?
!
Are you all right?
I missed you, friend.
San-po, the game's up.
Give up now.
I will fight until I'm dead.
Are you trying to kill me?
!
Put it back in!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
All the entrances are blocked.
How do we get out?
I still have a grenade left.
Let's go.
Raise the sail.
Fast around to the west by 18.
How far to land?
About 126 feet.
If we're that near, then why can't we see it?
It's underneath us.
Look at the sun.
Left is south.
Right is north.
I thought the sun rose in the east.
Is that right?
Wrong direction, turn around.
So we've been going the wrong way for three days?
Don't blame me.
The sun only just came out.
At least we know it's wrong now.
Big Mouth, test the wind.
Sail with the wind!
Bring her round.
Look!
The sun is going down.
It's not rising.
It's the wrong direction again!
Bring her round.
Here we go again!
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-achion rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eigtht period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A- sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orctard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
when the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P. J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one nigth a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
Ste was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could tear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the figthing had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practise for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent when I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Staggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bustels of fun
Now the jingle top has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a brigth time It's the rigth time
To rock the nigth away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-torse sleigh
Giddyap jingle torse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
What's so great about Caesar?
Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
And when did it become OK for one person to be the boss of everybody?
Because that's not what Rome is about!
We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
Ste knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my touse at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch."
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea"
"at Barnes and Noble."
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Gething hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred but forget what you heard I'm like James bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. Yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Lmmediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole burn book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks. "
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So...
-...how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G1 4 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G1 4."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller Id.
Not when you connect from information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 41 1?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well...grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are...a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "l heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 1 3, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. and the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kalteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got...
-...one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
...is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kalteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kalteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1 :1 0.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kalteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 1 4 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "l made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 1 2.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis lan.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred but forget what you heard I'm like James bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. Yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis lan.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Lmmediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole burn book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis lan.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
Let's start with the floor.
Try to place it.
We need to start with the foundation first.
So it'll be balanced.
I told you we need to start with the floor.
I'm a former Boy Scout.
On my honor as an elementary school student.
Just trust me.
Are you joking?
I was part of the Young Astronauts of Korea!
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Building houses is your specialty!
I drove for you.
And I was a member of ICY.
I will take care of safety and the medical treatment.
While you were dancing at the nightclub, I was designing one.
And while Yoon was reading in the reading room, I was remodeling one.
I'm just going to assume you two will take care of the tent.
-Oh~
-I told you to just trust me.
Hey, I'm hungry.
Let's eat.
Unpack what you brought.
Damn!
Just drinks?
You didn't bring anything to eat?
No one bought ramyun?
Then what about you?
We'll fry this, boil this and deep fry that.
Hey, leave it. "Where there are women, there is food to eat." by Lee Jeong Rok.
Just a minute.
Would you please?
I'd like to give you the fortune of trading 19 year old liquor with some ramyun.
You're just a little too late.
We already traded.
With whom?
Over there.
With the guys playing basketball.
Man...
Damn...
This is why I said we should decide who's bring what beforehand.
You people, you have no wisdom!
Wait.
I'll make it so you can eat ramyun.
You're going to steal it?
People in the know, know that my name used to be synonymous with basketball.
Man, do I need to challenge them?
They'll be embarrassed.
-Foul!
Foul!
-No way!
-Here, here.
Let's make a toast!
-Cheers!
To victory!
Ah, so delicious!
When the heck was the last time you played basketball?
!
My last victory was in 1994.
What?
!
That was 18 years ago!
A Gentleman's Dignity
Episode 11
It's really been a long time.
How are you...
Still pretty?
By nature, everyone's first love is still pretty.
Your personality hasn't changed.
No, I've become a lot nicer as I aged.
Have all of you been well?
I heard the four of you still hang out together.
Because we have no other friends.
If you don't like it, I'll stop meeting them.
I want to see them too.
Do you want to see them once?
No, I need to go back soon on the night plane.
Oh.
But then why'd you come to Korea?
A troublesome matter has occurred.
Actually, I need your help with that.
Sure.
Tell me, tell me.
I have a son and he's in Korea right now.
Oh...you have a son.
Judging by his credit card transactions I think he traveled all over Korea and is in Seoul now.
He might go visit you guys.
Us?
I'm not sure.
But he took the picture of you guys and wrote your shop's address when he left.
By chance, if he visits you, could you contact me?
No problem!
I don't know about the others, but we had a special relationship, right?
Then I have one more request.
Don't tell the others that you met me.
I just really came to see only you.
Me?
Only me?
Alright. it's our secret.
When's your flight?
I could give you a ride to the airport.
As expected.
It was me.
She liked me.
Ah!
Aigo, I want to brag, how am I going to resist?
But where'd this bastard go?
Today's prior appointment is with you, Seo Yi Soo.
I thought you'd left.
I was going to, but came back.
You're a strange woman.
Did you really need to come back and hear me say, "I have nothing to say to you?"
Let's stop.
I'm so sad I feel like I'm going to die.
Why do I like a bastard like you?
Seriously, I waited all day...
You...
Like me?
You didn't know?
Just a moment ago at the window, you looked so appealing to me I could have died!
Yes!
I like you, Kim Do Jin.
I like you, I like you!
My feeling were stirred for a while and
I couldn't be obvious about it because I was afraid you'd say I have no fidelity, going back and forth between men!
And I'm not asking you to accept my confession, so if you want to ignore me...
It was a memorable confession.
♪ Pretending I don't know.
♪ Pretending it's not true.
Pretending I didn't see you.
♪ Meeting you everyday I've learned to love you.
♪ I'm longing for you.
♪ I want only to reach out to you.
♪ I want only to embrace you.
♪ After being unable to even say the words "I love you",
♪The moment you turn and leave, I long for you.
♪The moment you turn and leave, I long for you.
Since when did you start to like me?
What do you like about me?
Because you're like a flower.
Why's this person so objective?
Excluding things the whole nation knows.
"I'm going to start a one-sided love."
I got butterflies in my stomach when you said that.
When I saw my picture in your wallet, my heart fluttered.
When you said, "Can you love me?"
I wavered.
In front of the restaurant, when you said you need to let me go...
I was afraid for the first time.
If this person doesn't like me, what do I do?
Starting from when I first saw you and until yesterday...
I was afraid, "This person doesn't like me." "What do I do?"
We kissed and hugged.
What'll we do the next time we meet?
Let's hold hands.
We didn't do that.
Teacher.
What's this?
You sobbed, but in the end...
Have you agreed to be each others'?
The two of you?
You cried?
Did this woman cry?
I'm not going to tell you!
I should've told you beforehand.
But I...hope you support us.
I do support you, but...
Why do I feel tears forming?
I'm going.
Come inside for a moment....
I'll give her a ride home.
Go inside.
Then I'll ask you as a favor.
I'll call you.
Whatever.
Me too!
Call me.
Are you using well the information I gave you?
The password to our house.
I don't know.
I forgot it.
You've already stopped by.
Why do you keep talking to me?
I'm not in the mood to talk to you.
Then why are you answering?
Why'd you get in my car?
Then let me get off and go.
Im Meahri.
I know you didn't think highly of the women I've dated before, but
I'm being sincere right now, to your teacher.
It seems like it.
Do you want to come over to my house?
Pretend it's by coincidence.
Would he say anything if I went?
He said he won't see me again and left.
Yoon Oppa.
Then what about this?
Get robbed by Yoon's client too and refuse to settle.
In my experience, it's very effective.
There's something easier.
What is it?
Can't you just get married to my teacher this week?
Then Yoon Oppa would come.
Or do you have a child hidden somewhere?
So you could celebrate their first birthday.
Why's everyone acting like this?
Why's everyone doing this to me today?
I know.
What's that?
In front of the house.
Are they the only ones dating?
Looks like Pro Hong is leaving.
It's worthwhile to do events.
You even escort me home.
Go inside, Princess.
Good night!
Now I don't like having to part every night.
It's good to miss each other.
It's better to miss each other when we wake up in the morning.
If we're next to each other,
I wouldn't like it.
There's no tension.
I don't want to be your family.
I want to be your woman.
I'm leaving now.
5 more minutes.
Then go.
You've been saying, "5 more minutes," for 20 minutes now.
Oh, seriously!
I've developed a new hobby recently.
Want me to crash into Pro Hong's car?
You're the worst.
Stealing my teacher from me.
Oh, now that you mention it...
Can you not meet your teacher for a while?
Why?
Baseball, teaching classes...
She's already busy as it is.
If you are part of her schedule too, I think I'll be pushed aside.
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to date that woman.
Oh, really!
So annoying!
Why'd you come here?
I came so we could have lunch together.
And to start a rumor at your school that you have a man now.
Should I have gone to the teacher's room?
You must be crazy!
At my workplace!
Would you consider transferring by any chance?
To an all girls high school.
You're too popular with the younger guys.
-Teacher, is that your boyfriend?
-Oh, Teacher, you're skilled!
-Hey!
The Goddess of Ethics is dating!
-I'm getting goosebumps!
She's with her boyfriend!
-Where?
Let me see!
-Come and see!
Whoo!
Get up quickly.
Let's go somewhere else.
You!
Who said you could leave school during lunch?
Go back quickly!
I can see your feet!
Teacher, your boyfriend is handsome!
Whoo!
Park Tae Hyun, you!
Teacher, your boyfriend is handsome!
Whoo!
Park Tae Hyun, you!
You're a very honest child!
Follow me!
What did you say?
!
Should I say it again?
Why don't you act more innocent?
It's our first day dating.
But I just ended my one-sided love and
I'm trying to have a pink romance.
Why are you doing this to me?
You want me to have a one-sided love again?
You didn't have one for me.
You only had one for Tae San.
By any chance, are you being jealous right now?
Why?
Did you think an older and handsome looking man would be so understanding?
What do I do if you say this now?
You should've said it before I confessed.
For whose benefit?
Manual for One-sided Love:
1.
Think about me all day.
Without eating or sleeping.
2.
If I don't answer my phone or respond to a text, get hurt and be anxious.
3.
Try hanging around my office or house, while hoping you run into me.
4.
Even if you see me, watch me endlessly from far away.
Lovingly.
5.
If I talk to another woman, become crazy with jealousy and consider crashing into her with your car.
6.
Obtain my elementary, middle, and high school graduation photo, no matter how, and put it in your wallet.
7.
Come to my house abruptly sometimes and make my heart flutter.
That's it, for now.
What if I say I can't?
Then do you want to go on a vacation with me?
I have a class 5th period!
Did your talk with Meahri go well yesterday?
I told her clearly so she'd understand, "Don't hang around my woman."
"That woman's time is mine from now on."
Kim Do Jin!
Mom, why are you telling me that Oppa's not answering your calls?
He's not busy, he's avoiding you.
Because you tell him to get married every day.
I guess his girlfriend doesn't want to get married to Oppa.
I just got to work now.
So, I'm busy.
Let's hang up~
-Welcome.
-Welcome...
One mango coconut and one mango banana.
To go.
Alright.
Charging $11.80.
One coconut and one banana.
The one mango coconut and one mango banana, you ordered, is ready.
Why's it two?
Are you going to give one to Attorney Kang?
Attorney Choi, a client is waiting for you in the office.
Thank you.
Here.
Oh!
Are you giving these to me?
Thank you.
But why'd you buy two?
One would take too short and three would be sneaky.
That's why it's two.
Pardon?
Enjoy them.
Do you remember me?
We have met before
You were with Meahri.
What brings you here?
I need counsel from you.
I don't know any other lawyer.
Can I sit?
This is not a place for counselling about a romantic relationship.
Romance counselling would be much more promising than legal counsel.
How about looking for another lawyer?
I charge $500 per hour.
I can't recommend myself.
I have a father.
Usually everyone has one.
I have two of them.
So?
The biological father doesn't know about my existence.
I also knew about him recently.
Of course, we are not in the same family register.
After I find him, if it proves that I'm his biological son, am I the person who would inherit his property?
Or, does he need to be dead?
What are you thinking?
Do you remember a boy who was looking for Meahri in your Cafe before?
Of course I remember him.
I saw him a few times.
Why?
A few times?
Did he seem to be very close to her?
What kind of genre of jealousy is it?
Do you mean Meahri is playing a two timer which is a thrilling fantasy and adventure?
So, do you now feel bad about it?
-Why are the sparks coming my way?
-So it's hot, my friend?
Be quiet!
How did he make it noisy again?
I always make a noise.
That's why I always get told to, "Be quiet!" or "Shut up!"
Be quiet!
You're not going to set up a TV in your store?
The baseball game is going on now.
At my store, water and screens are self-service.
If you want one hang it up yourself.
Do the Blue Cats have no intention of scouting me?
What?
As a baseball?
As a pitcher.
After knowing nothing except throwing a drinking glass?
-Why do you suddenly want to be a pitcher?
-Look at how slow this lawyer and this soldier are.
Why a pitcher?
Because pitchers face the umpire!
-Oh~
-Wow!
-Be quiet!
Just make me a Black Russian.
-Yes customer.
Welcome
Perhaps,
Hey, aren't you Lee Jeong Rok?
Glad to see you!
How have you stayed the same?
You haven't changed at all!
Yea...
Yea!
You...changed a lot!
Lower your heads, quickly!
Oh, you're Kim Do Jin, right?
And you're Yoon!
Wow, you still hang out together?
Yea...
Do you know him?
Not sure.
I think Tae San knows.
What is he doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I must've fallen asleep for a moment.
Yea, why?
Hey, you!
Im Tae San!
Oh, wow!
It's really been a long time!
You guys are really still the same.
I aged a lot, right?
My daughter is already attending college.
Oh I see!
We're busy, we have to go somewhere else.
Hey, let's go.
We're going to be late.
-Where?
-Who?
Yea, Jeong Seok!
Yea, Na Jeong Seok!
I'm really glad to see you!
Ahjussis, how do you know my father?
How'd we meet like this?
Did you guys get married?
Let's sit down and have a drink.
No!
No!
No!
This place is really expensive and doesn't even taste good!
Go somewhere else!
Don't come here!
Dont!
The mood here really sucks!
Really?
It seems alright.
Oh, right.
You guys haven't seen my daughter, right?
-So I guess you are dating.
-What?
While you're looking at your underwear you're thinking it's not appropriate, right?
When, where, and what kind of man did you think you'd meet?
What is this?
Kittens are no good?
Maybe there are men who aren't like that.
There probably is, but amongst them there's no man like Kim Do Jin.
Just put your clothes on, let's go out.
Where?
Does Do Jin ssi prefer that kind of style?
Tae San likes things like this.
Do guys really like that?
What's not to like?
Men want to find you sexy when they want to take it off not after you've taken it off.
Hey, someone might listen.
Men want to find you sexy when they want to take it off not after you've taken it off.
Hey, someone might listen.
You listen.
You!
Since it'll be too hard for you to go straight from a kitten to leopard, pick from what I pick for you.
Things like this.
-It's an invitation.
-An invitation?

Oppa!
I really missed you!
You're not acting like this because of the time!
You're doing this because I like Yoon Oppa!
Oppa!
Yoon Oppa!
Oppa you're just going to leave.
Just wait a moment, I'll go there!
A pretty woman like me and the only daughter of a rich family.
Can you understand this from a common-sense point of view?
Tonight's the last month of June...
T T
This is the only way we can talk to each other.
Yoon Oppa...
If you're free, could we meet for a moment?
Really?
Really?
What did you want to say?
I just flew here.
So far, I think I haven't treated you as a 24-year-old woman.
I heard you majored in Business Administration, but did you graduate?
I quit in the middle because I wanted to make bags and I also missed you too.
Bags?
I actually wanted to study fashion design.
But as I rushed too much, I just...
By the way, why are you asking about it?
This is the kind of topic that is supposed to be discussed with a 24-year-old person.
Im Meahri, don't you have any dream?
What you do these days is just follow me, that's all.
Do you want to make bags?
But is that possible without putting out any effort?
Other people at your age who have the same dream as yours are working hard to get better scores on TOEIC or are applying for some contest and so on,
Putting all their time in building better qualifications for their career.
But what are you doing now?
"Don't contact me",
"Don't like me",
I came here expecting to hear those lines.
I came here to see you one more time, even though you would say those lines.
Who said I don't have any dream?
!
I have a dream too!
But to me, you're more urgent than anything else.
Because I've been waiting for you for longer than anything else.
Because being a designer is my dream, but you are my fate.
Because sometimes the fate can pass by...
Love... is important.
But are you going to measure your value only as somebody's lover?
If it's really your fate, it can't be avoided.
So, stop caring about me and focus on yourself.
I'll leave.
Ha... you couldn't even enter the house today?
If there is any part of you that I can beat up, I would beat you up..
You look nicer with hair, so I can't shave your hair either.
I'm going crazy, really.
What about the protective wall?
Should we go with the shotcrete application?
No problems with CAP either.
Water flows on both side of the land.
We need to go with the safest, regardless of how much money it'll cost.
The President of this place also thinks that.
Okay.
Let's go to the construction site next weekend.
And check the calcite again.
Again?
Why?
If the flow of the river and the resort's water meet perpendicularly, the water can become clogged.
Then the pontoon, currently placed for reflecting, needs to be relocated so that the water flow is the same.
We need to go to the construction site to get the answer.
Alright.
Then have a good trip.
Ah, why's my body feeling so heavy lately?
My head hurts and my stomach hurts...
Why's your stomach hurting?
It hasn't been long since you took pyschological leave.
Hey you've been dating for 2 years, but I've only been dating for 2 days now.
Do you know how important weekends are for me?
A woman can wait for three times, but the clients never wait more than three minutes.
I'll stop by the Bundang construction site and go to Se Ra's place on time.
See you later.
By the way, why does this woman not show any reaction?
♪ What hairstyle would be good?
♪ What expression would be cool?
♪ Before I meet you I practice 100 times~ ♪
♪ The most beautiful words in the world. ♪
♪ThewordsIonlywant tosayto you .
♪ Close your eyes and listen.
♪ I'll confess.
I love you~
How's it going on the two slopes for the ski resort?
Since we need to change it within a fixed shape, there are a lot of issues.
I'll complete it and hand it to you by the beginning of next week.
Okay.
Go work.
Yes.
How far is far away?
♪I onlyseeyou .
♪ I only long for you.
♪ It feels like fate.
♪ Even in my dreams, I only see you.
♪ Because I love you~
Take two steps back to your 7 o' clock.
Here?
Right there.
Do I look like a very strange woman now?
You look like a woman who's really enamored with me.
I can't dodge that.
What's it like to see me from far away?
From far away you look...pretty cool.
Of course.
I'm standing very carefully.
Come up.
I'm even more cool from nearby.
And you'll struggle to breathe if you look at me closely.
The imported car dealership.
This is the 2nd draft.
If the outside is this showy, will the cars on display inside be noticeable?
Are you looking for Tae San?
Pardon?
I said to give the design some points.
The building can't become the point.
What are you doing?
I'm waiting.
For what?
Jealousy.
Continue talking.
Oh, yes.
I heard a lot about you.
The rumor our Manager is dating has circulated.
Oh, I didn't tell anyone.
Why didn't you?
I started that rumor.
The rumor needs to circulate, so that I can leave work early.
While you film movies on the emergency staircase while having an office romance.
Then, I'm leaving.
Jealousy?
What person...
You're crazy!
Crazy!
In the office?
You're not...getting off work?
What should we do?
Should we take the emergency staircase?
Is it better for the end to be sharp or round?
The ones prewashed are better.
Is it better for the end to be sharp or round?
The ones prewashed are better.
Aren't you tired of eating out?
Washing, frying, and cleaning is more tiresome.
Let's have a salmon salad.
When are Do Jin ssi and Yi Soo coming?
They should be here soon.
Put oil in the pan and preheat it.
Okay!
But you know...
My mother wants to meet you once.
When do you want to?
I don't want to.
Sit down for a moment.
Do you not want to marry me?
Why are you suddenly bringing up marriage?
As you know, I'm the oldest son...
Are you really not thinking about marrying me?
I like Im Tae San, but I don't like marriage.
You and I are old enough to have been married twice!
That's true for most people.
But I don't want to!
If I get married, what'll I do about practicing?
You can do it after you get married too.
Why do you act like the world will end if you get married?
What if I get pregnant?
Then Hong Se Ra, the professional golfer will no longer exist!
Why are you lying and saying the world won't end?
Am I twenty-five years old?
What do I need to say at times like this?
You really make me crazy.
Tell them today's party is cancelled.
Why do you hate marriage so much?
I do hate it.
But it's also really hard!
Then I'll help.
Are you going to have the baby?
You said you're the oldest son.
It's marriage now, but after we get married you'll badger me about having a baby!
Is that really...the only reason?
What do you mean?
It's not that you're not done playing?
Everything just sounds like an excuse to me.
It's not that you want to play more and enjoy life more?
When we started, I definitely told you that our relationship won't end in marriage.
So, from the very beginning, you just wanted to play for a while and break up?
That's right.
Usually people don't decide to do something for just one reason.
All right then.
Let's just say that we only dated for awhile and broke up!
Let's do that.
If I'd wanted to get married, I wouldn't have picked you either.
Yea?
Now?
Ok, I'll come out.
I'm going to drink till I die today.
Set up enough drinks.
You have more patience than I thought you would.
What?
How'd you resist when you like me this much?
Well, I didn't like you enough that I felt like I was going to die or had trouble breathing.
No way.
But where are we going now?
Home.
Whose house?
Is there a house you want to go to?
Should we go to Tae San's house?
Ah!
Seriously...
Then do you want to go on a vacation?
Really...
Today your houseowner is opening their homebar.
You didn't know even though you live with her?
If you don't want to, then we could go on a vacation.
Oh my...
I can listen to some music, right?
I'll do it.
My Betty will still find your touch unfamiliar.
Do you like Betty or me more?
There's no traffic.
Do you like Betty more or me more?
I'll answer when we get off.
Why?
Betty is listening.
I'm home.
What's this?
Did you lie?
There's too much circumstantial evidence for it to have been a lie.
Where'd they go?
Se Ra!
It looks like they stopped cooking suddenly...
Right after she oiled the pan and right before they cooked the eggs, they fought and left.
Why'd they fight?
They're a couple that fights everyday.
Well, since it looks like we won't starve, it's okay.
I'm going to try calling them.
They could've gone out to buy something.
Sorry, let's cancel today's dinner.
I'm right.
We just need to cook the eggs to finish.
Let's finish cooking them.
They really fought.
Put your jacket in the room.
Or it'll smell like the food.
Thank you.
Why are you looking at my underwear?
You didn't lay them out so I could pick?
Go out now!
Quickly!
Did you get the right size?
I think it'll be too big.
Aish!
I'm not that...they won't!
Quickly, aren't you leaving?
I don't like corsets or things like garter belts because they're inconvenient.
You're crazy!
Get out, quickly!
But why'd you suddenly buy 5 sets?
I bought them because I needed to.
Get out, quickly!
Just clean the table.
And from now on, please respect my privacy.
Do you really want me to?
Really respect it?
Then you'll be really disappointed.
I'm warning you, stop talking about things like that.
Right?
A man who only uses words is not that great, right?
Then should I use action now?
I like number 3 the best.
Out of the ones I just saw.
From the left or from the right?
There were 5.
I'm so hungry!
Just finish cooking these.
I know you don't like eggs, but I do.
This is our first time having a meal together.
That's right.
But you're a picky eater.
Why don't you eat carrots?
Because I'm not a grown up yet.
I guess all of your past is in there.
To be exact it's all in a computer.
Since I transfer the files daily.
I listened to your secret private world.
It's really a world I didn't know about.
Was it risque and entertaining?
I felt like it'll be really risque and entertaining to be with this man.
I can guarantee it.
So I didn't know and so I did know, in front of me and behind my back...
Thank you for liking me.
Why'd you like Tae San when you were going to be like this?
I wonder if the woman whose shoe size is 245 is doing well or not.
Whoa!
She looked really young.
How old is she?
As expected, you're progressing quickly.
Looking into my past, getting jealous, and pretending to be indifferent...
This woman does all 3 at once.
Are you proud of having dated so many women?
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Then what can I do?
They keep following me.
How old is she?
She's younger than you, Seo Yi Soo.
A graduate student.
In case you're curious.
What about her last name?
What Eun Ji is she?
Sexy Eun Ji.
Seriously!
Why do you want to know that?
Women want to know things like that by nature.
Kim.
Oh, Kim Eun Ji.
It's a bit common, her name.
Then what about the woman who said, "Guess who?"
Do you want a list of all the women I've dated?
Forget it.
Just go.
Where?
A vacation?
Go home.
You're done eating.
A picky eater!
Be careful on your way back.
Then until the next season.
Farewell.
Why're you sulking?
119.
Emergency.
She was right to the end.
To the end.
Oppa, why do you keep avoiding Mom's calls?
Mom wants me to detain you and call her.
Talk to her now.
Tell her I'm on a business trip.
On the other side of the world.
Chile, Peru, Brazil...
Somewhere near there.
Why?
Ah please!
Because she keeps pestering me about getting married.
Did you not know that'd be mentioned?
If you're going to act like this...
Should I get married first?
You.
Hwak!
Do you think I paid for you to study abraod so you could become an ahjumma at the age of twenty-four?
Then make her not call me.
If she calls me one more time,
I'm going to tell her what Se Ra Unni's like!
That... 119.
Emergency.
What?
Again?
What'd you say?
His wife is coming to my office tomorrow to get a divorce.
She's really going to terminate the buildings' lease agreements?
Not the buildings.
She said she's going to terminate the marriage.
She said she's going to sign the divorce papers.
It's not the worst.
When did she notify you?
Just now.
It's serious this time.
The nuance is different than the threats she usually makes once or twice a year.
Has it just been a day or two?
Why are you acting like an amateur?
He said the nuance is different!
Do you want to live with your wife?
Of course.
Who else would I live with?
No.
Do you love your wife?
I do.
I just drink tea with women.
Do I sleep with them or buy them officetels?
That's true.
What do you mean that's true?
Then where did you go last week when you lied to her about being with us?
It's just something like that.
Something like what?
Was it Baek Hae Joo?
Why are you mentioning her?
President Kang?
No.
It was a girl, but it wasn't a date, cheating, concubine, an affair or anything like that!
I can't tell you anything else.
Ah!
Se Ra's problem is complicated enough as it is...
So what are you going to do about this situation?
Did something happen?
I should've asked.
Did he maybe go to see Kim Eun Ji?
Of all the names why's it Kim Eun Ji?
Ah, if I was in a higher governmental position,
I could find out.
What am I doing?
!
Let's just work.
Hello?
Are you Kim Dong Hyub's guardian?
What kind of trouble did that child create now?
This is a hospital.
A hospital?
What's wrong with you?
How did this happen?
Was there an accident?
Where and how did you get hurt?
!
You need to ask the doctor that.
You weren't hurt enough, were you?
What happen?
Who did you fight again?
Are you the patient, Kim Dong Hyub's guardian?
Yes!
What happen?
Is he really hurt?
We're treated him already.
But someone needs to pay for the medical fee.
That person says she can't pay.
Hey!
I told you to go on a delivery, how could you cause trouble?
What are you going to do about the motorcycle?
You completely ruined it!
Since this was all caused by your carelessness, you take care of it!
I can't pay for your medical fees and the repair costs for the motorcyle is coming from your pay, alright?
How can you do that?
Did I make you get in an accident?
Did I?
Don't ever contact me again!
Can you look at me for a moment?
Me?
Are you a business owner in Republic of Korea?
What's this woman saying?
So that child deliveries for your store?
So what?
You know the Adolescent Labor Standard Law, right?
Do you know that student is not yet eighteen?
Did you get his consent to work overtime at night?
Are you paying him 150% for overtime?
On holidays when there's no school, did you follow the law and only made him work less than 7 hours?
Do you have motorcycle insurance?
Who are you?
Who are you to act like a know-it-all?
She's my guardian.
I'm this student's home room teacher.
You heard everything I said just now, right?
If you didn't get his consent you have to pay a really large fine,
So you're... a teacher?
I just need to pay the medical fee, right?
Of course you need to pay the medical fee.
Anyway, I'm going to report you to the police.
Then take care.
Give me your parents' phone number.
No excuse me?
Don't you see me talking to my student right now?
That is why I like you teacher!
Shut up!
You said that you're attending a private instituate.
That's why I let you leave during the day.
Give me your parents' number.
Give me your parents' number!
I never said I had them.
My mom ran away when I was in middle school and...
My dad is probably drunk somewhere.
Just be my guardian for a day.
Then...
What will you do for me?
What kind of teacher wants something from her student?
I want things.
I want the students in my class have good grades and if they have bad grades I hope they at least have a good personality.
I'd like them to be cheerful and I hope they have dreams.
I'd like them to believe that if they work diligently they can achieve anything.
I hope they don't blame their home-life and waste their youths playing games.
What do you want to do out of those for me?
I will think about it.
You promised.
I'm going to sleep.
I'm sleepy.
What are you talking about?
If you don't convince her, who will?
Like you did before, just once, can't you write resolutions and things like that agin?
Really what is wrong with you guys?
Should I really just get divorced?
If I get divorced all of you have to move out of your offices.
Then you'll suffer losses too!
Hey, you jerk.
Do you think that we've been doing that because of our offices?
To put it bluntly, we just need to move our offices.
We just need to pay $10 or $20k more each month for rent and live comfortably.
But you keep ruining one woman's life all the time and our friend's fate was on the line.
That's why we took your side.
But truthfully, shouldn't you change now?
How do I need to change?
This is me!
Don't you know?
I didn't know I'd have to write up your divorce papers with my hands.
Of course there were times we helped you create an alibi for our benefit, but do you think that was the only reason?
We sincerely wanted you and your wife to live happily.
Hey, are you guys really going to be like this?
Do you know how much service I've given you guys?
You really want me to just get divorced like this?
Hey, why aren't you saying anything?
Do you want me to speak honestly?
If it hadn't been for these guys, I would've cut you out of my life a long time ago.
I think you've already gone beyond our ability to interfere.
How could you say such sad things?
You bastard, really...
During the 10 years you've been married, how many days have you not made your wife upset?
We understand because we're your friends.
But now because we're your friends we can't understand you.
We've decided to move HwaDan and my law office out of your wife's buildings.
Hey!
Really, you guys...
The rest of you leave.
His wife will be here soon.
Yoon, I still love Park Min Sook.
That hasn't changed.
I might lose you in the future but this is my last request as your friend.
Dissuade Park Min Sook.
Please?
I can't live without Park Min Sook.
Who else will accept a bastard like me?
I can't leave my wife!
Please help me!
Yes!
Oh, man!
Wow, your actings skills are impressive!
You guys were like Al Pacino!
-We should just...hwak!
-What are we doing because of you?
Now we're even..
It's easier to protect the world's peace than this!
My Park Min Sook was completely fooled, right?
But you seemed like you were telling the truth earlier.
Because it was the truth!
99% of a fraud is done truthfully!
Only the information is a lie.
I enjoyed the show.
Your acting was quite moving.
I rate you 1.5 stars.
His wife is too skilled to live with Jeong Rok.
Aigo, seriously!
What?
Where are you guys going?
-Hey, what are you doing?
Knock.
-Say something.
-You do it.
Why's it always me?
She believes you the most.
Go, quickly!
Why me?
You do it.
Hello?
Are you there?
-Louder.
-Talk louder!
How could she hear that?
We can't hear you and we're right here!
Ok ok!
Hello?
You can't knock that loud!
Manual for One-sided Love:
7.
Come to my house abruptly sometimes and make my heart flutter.
When you came to me, wear these.
On a good day.
Prettily.
Your wife didn't contact you again?
What do we do about this now?
Why'd you fight with Pro Hong again?
Aren't you tired of fighting?
Just get married.
That's why we fought.
Next year my father's going to have his 70th birthday party but
I didn't upset him when I entered and left the force.
But I'm being undutiful now that I'm old.
Yea, you are a bit undutiful.
Shut up!
My friends are here now...
Oh I see!
-Hello.
-Hi!
Sorry, I came to see Kim Do Jin.
I didn't know you were here.
No please come in!
Who..?
I came to meet all four of you.
It is nice to see you!
I'm Kim Eun Hee's son.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. and the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis lan.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
...is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my house at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa
"with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
lmmediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch.
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea
"at Barnes and Noble.
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis lan.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eighth period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A-sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis lan, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P.J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
She was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the fighting had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practice for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis lan.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent When I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Shaggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. and the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
"Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant
"while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
"What's so great about Caesar?
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
"OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
"People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
"And when did it become OK for one person
"to be the boss of everybody?
"Because that's not what Rome is about!
"We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
She knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my touse at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch."
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea"
"at Barnes and Noble."
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Gething hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
This is your lunch, OK?
Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk.
You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.
Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it.
OK?
You ready?
I think so.
It's Cady's big day.
I guess it's natural for parents to cry on their kid's first day of school.
But, you know, this usually happens when the kid is 5.
I'm 16 and until today, I was home-schooled.
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."
X
- Y
- L-O
- C
- A-R-P.
Xylocarp.
Or that we're weirdly religious or something.
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-achion rifle so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.
And the homosexuals.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But my family's totally normal.
Except for the fact that both my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 12 years in Africa.
I had a great life.
But then my mom got offered tenure at Northwestern University.
So it was goodbye Africa and hello high school.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I'll be careful.
Hi.
I don't know if anyone told you about me.
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.
You don't wanna sit there.
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.
Hey, baby.
He farts a lot.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
It's not you.
I'm bad luck.
Ms. Norbury?
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Is everything all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.
- So how was your summer?
- I got divorced.
My carpal tunnel came back.
- I win.
- Yes, you do.
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that we have a new student joining us.
She just moved here all the way from Africa.
Welcome.
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.
Her name is Cady.
Cady Heron.
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.
I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony.
Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
Well, welcome, Cady.
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.
And if you need anything or if you wanna talk to somebody...
Thanks.
Maybe some other time, when my shirt isn't see-through.
OK.
OK.
Good day, everybody.
The first day of school was a blur.
A stressful, surreal blur.
I got in trouble for the most random things.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
You need the lavatory pass.
OK.
Can I have the lavatory pass?
Nice try.
Have a seat.
I had never lived in a world where adults didn't trust me, where they were always yelling at me.
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!
No food in class!
I told you, I saw the whole thing.
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.
I had a lot of friends in Africa.
What?
But so far, none in Evanston.
Hey.
How was your first day?
Is that your natural hair color?
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.
Thank you.
See, this is the color I want.
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.
Do you guys know where Room G 14 is?
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G 14."
I think that's in the back building.
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.
Thanks.
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!
"Health.
Spanish."
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?
Because it's the same in every country.
That's beautiful.
This girl is deep.
Where's the back building?
It burned down in 1987.
Won't we get in some sort of trouble for this?
Why would we get you into trouble?
We're your friends.
I know it's wrong to skip class, but Janis said we were friends.
And I was in no position to pass up friends.
I guess I'll never know what I missed on that first day of health class.
Don't have sex.
Because you will get pregnant and die.
Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
Just don't do it, promise?
OK, everybody take some rubbers.
Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
They wanted me to get socialized.
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.
- What?
- Own it.
How do you spell your name again, Cady?
It's Cady.
C-A-D-Y.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.
In the name of all that is holy, will you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.
If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover.
That one there, that's Karen Smith.
She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.
Damian sat next to her in English last year.
She asked me how to spell "orange".
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.
She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business.
She knows everything about everyone.
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.
And evil takes a human form in Regina George.
Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced ho-bag.
But in reality, she is so much more than that.
She's the queen bee.
The star.
Those other two are just her little workers.
Regina George.
How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
Regina George is flawless.
She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.
One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
And he told her she was pretty.
One time, she punched me in the face.
It was awesome.
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
- Who cares?
- I care.
Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling.
And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee.
And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee,
I would say, yeah, I care.
Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.
Here.
This map is gonna be your guide to North Shore.
Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial because you got everybody there.
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, JV jocks,
Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.
Hey.
We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students.
Can you answer a few questions?
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?
What?
Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?
Jason, why are you such a skeez?
I'm just being friendly.
You were supposed to call me last night.
Jason.
You do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later.
She's not interested.
Do you wanna have sex with him?
- No, thank you.
- Good.
So it's settled.
So you can go shave your back now.
Bye, Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit down.
Seriously, sit down.
Why don't I know you?
I'm new.
I just moved here from Africa.
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.
Wait.
What?
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.
So you've actually never been to a real school before?
Shut up.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.
But you're, like, really pretty.
- Thank you.
- So you agree.
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang.
From England.
So if you're from Africa why are you white?
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.
So we'll see you tomorrow.
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?
And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
Regina seems sweet.
Regina George is not sweet.
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!
She's fabulous, but she's evil.
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.
I love your work!
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?
Regina.
You seem to really hate her.
Yes.
What's your question?
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor
- that Janis was...
- Damian!
Shall we not?
Now, look.
This isn't about hating her, OK?
I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?
Would you just do it?
Please?
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?
- Yes.
- No.
By eigtht period, I was so happy to get to math class.
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.
Nothing in math class could mess me up.
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
I've only had one other crush in my life.
His name was Nfume, and we were 5.
It didn't work out.
But this one hit me like a big, yellow school bus.
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...
So cute.
I mean, A- sub-N equals N plus one over four.
That's right.
That's good.
Very good.
All right, let's talk about your homework.
Hey.
How was your second day?
- Fine.
- Were people nice?
- No.
- Did you make any friends?
Yeah.
Having lunch with The Plastics was like leaving the actual world and entering "Girl World".
And Girl World had a lot of rules.
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.
So I guess you picked today.
Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays.
Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch.
I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,
I would be sitting over there with the art freaks.
Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.
Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
A hundred and twenty calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?
Forty-eight into 120?
I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
It's 40 percent.
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100, and then you cross-multiply and get the value of X.
Whatever.
I'm getting cheese fries.
So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
Well, there's this guy in my calculus class...
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
They went out for a year.
Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
OK, irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends.
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.
It'll be our little secret.
We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
Even though I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,
I was still allowed to look at him.
And think about him.
And talk to him.
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes.
We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl.
So you should think about joining.
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.
OK, so think it over.
Because we'd like to get jackets.
OK.
Hey!
Get in, loser.
We're going shopping.
Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had.
I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.
- No!
No, no.
- No, no.
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.
Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
Being at Old Orctard Mall kind of reminded me of being home in Africa.
By the watering hole.
when the animals are in heat.
Oh, my God, there's Jason!
Where?
Oh, there he is.
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.
Wait.
Jason's not going out with Taylor.
No.
He cannot blow you off like that.
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.
Not when you connect from Information.
- Hello?
- Hello.
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
She's not home yet.
Who's calling?
Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood.
I have her test results.
If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can.
It's urgent.
Thank you.
She's not going out with anyone.
OK, that was so fetch.
Mom.
Your house is really nice.
I know, right?
Make sure you check out her mom's boob job.
They're hard as rocks.
I'm home!
Hey, Kylie.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?
Hey, Mrs. George.
This is Cady.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.
Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK?
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.
I'm a cool mom.
Right, Regina?
- Please stop talking.
- OK.
I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
This is your room?
It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.
Hey, put on 98.8.
Cady, do you even know who sings this?
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.
She's like a Martian.
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please.
I hate my calves.
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.
I used to think there was just fat and skinny.
Apparently, there's a lot of things that can be wrong on your body.
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.
My nail beds suck.
I have really bad breath in the morning.
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
Thanks.
Is there alcohol in this?
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?
Do you want a bit?
If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
- No, thank you.
- OK.
So, you guys, what is the 411?
What has everybody been up to?
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?
Mom.
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.
It's our Burn Book.
See, we cut out girls' pictures from the yearbook, and then we wrote comments.
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.
"Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
"Janis Ian, dyke."
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.
Yeah.
He's almost too gay to function.
That's funny.
Put that in there.
Oh, no.
Maybe that was only OK when Janis said it.
And they have this Burn Book where they write mean things
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No.
Cady, you gotta steal that book.
- No way!
- Oh, come on.
We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.
People who do evil stuff, and people who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it.
Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
I love seeing teachers outside of school.
It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.
Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.
My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
Your nana and I have that in common.
No, actually, I'm just here because I bartend a couple nights a week down at P. J. Calamity's.
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes, you know, because we start in a couple weeks and I would love to have a girl on the team, just, you know, so the team could meet a girl.
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.
Thanks, Damian.
Well, this has been sufficiently awkward.
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, man, that is bleak.
So when are you gonna see Regina again?
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.
- Hello?
- I know your secret.
Oh, God, busted.
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.
Secret?
What are you saying about?
Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels.
I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want.
But let me just tell you something about Aaron:
All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...
Whatever.
I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
Really?
You would do that?
I mean, nothing embarrassing, though, right?
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.
But wait.
Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
- No.
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy, but I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess she just likes the attention.
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.
I can't believe you think I like attention!
OK, love you.
See you tomorrow.
I had survived my first three-way calling attack.
And with Regina's blessing, I started talking to Aaron more and more.
On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
It's October 3rd.
Two weeks later, we spoke again.
It's raining.
Yeah.
But I wanted things to move faster.
So I followed my instincts.
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury was talking about.
It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
Wrong.
Is that the summation?
Yeah, they're the same thing.
Wrong.
He was so wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I get it now.
Lights, please.
OK.
See you guys tomorrow.
We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight.
You wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Here's where it is.
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.
OK.
That flier admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
"Grool."
I meant to say "cool" and then I started to say "great".
Right.
Well... grool.
See you tonight.
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
OK, I lied.
But I had to go home and work on my costume.
In the regular world, Halloween is when children dress up in costumes and beg for candy.
In Girl World, Halloween is the one nigth a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie and some form of animal ears.
Doesn't she look great, honey?
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.
Unfortunately, no one told me about the slut rule.
So I showed up like this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why are you dressed so scary?
It's Halloween.
Have you seen Jason?
You know who's looking fine tonight?
Seth Mosakowski.
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What?
He's a good kisser.
He's your cousin.
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
- Right.
- So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins,
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.
That's not right, is it?
That is so not right.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You made it.
And you are... a zombie bride.
An "ex-wife".
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Thanks.
Karen, stop it.
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!
Hey.
Oh, no.
Didn't anybody tell you?
You were supposed to wear a costume.
Shut up.
I need to talk to you.
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.
I invited her tonight.
Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
Really?
How do you know?
Because she told me.
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."
And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron"
and she wears it under all her clothes.
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?
I mean, you're gorgeous.
And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
What?
This was it.
Regina said she would talk to Aaron for me, and now she was.
I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
How could Janis hate Regina?
Ste was such a good...
Slut!
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?
You're so hot.
That's a scary mask, bro.
I had never felt this feeling before.
I could tear my heartbeat in my ears.
My stomach felt like it was going to fall out my butt.
I had this lump in my throat like after you dry-swallow a big pill.
I hated Regina.
I hated her!
She took him back.
Regina took Aaron back.
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?
Because she's a life-ruiner.
She ruins people's lives.
When we were 13, she made people sign this petition
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian!
Please!
Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK?
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?
Regina George is an evil dictator.
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?
You cut off her resources.
Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy technically good physique and ignorant band of loyal followers.
Now, Cady, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong.
Can you do it?
I can do it.
OK, let's rock this bitch.
Pretending like nothing was wrong turned out to be surprisingly easy.
Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back.
And that's not Regina's fault.
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.
Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
This isn't even cranberry juice.
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.
Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back.
Regina was dangling Aaron in front of me on purpose.
I knew how this would be settled in the animal world.
But this was Girl World.
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.
And in Girl World, all the figthing had to be sneaky.
All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
Wait.
I have this really good skin stuff I'll bring you.
OK.
We kept our eyes open for opportunities for sabotage.
Regina.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your face smells like peppermint.
This is ass, you guys.
It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
I've been really busy with choir.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.
We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.
I have to go to Regina's to practise for the talent show.
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."
You guys know that song?
Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
They do it every year.
Well, I have to learn it.
Go.
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.
She just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.
She's so pathetic.
Let me tell you something about Janis Ian.
We were best friends in middle school.
I know, right?
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even...
Whatever.
So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend,
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana.
And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him.
Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?"
And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party,
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian."
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party.
There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.
So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her.
It was so retarded.
And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her.
When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack.
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?
It was my mom's in the '80s.
Vintage.
So adorable.
Thanks.
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?
So are you gonna send any candy canes?
No.
I don't send them, I just get them.
So you better send me one, byotch.
Love you.
I was definitely sending her one.
I was gonna use three candy canes to crack Gretchen Wieners.
Three, please.
"Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus"
might translate into
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.
Glenn Cocco?
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.
And Cady Heron.
Do we have a Cady Heron here?
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners.
Bye.
Who's that from?
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."
That's so sweet.
OK, back to Caesar.
Once Gretchen thought Regina was mad at her, the secrets started pouring out.
All I had to do was wait for one we could use.
Thank you.
Welcome to the North Shore High School winter talent show.
Let me hear you make some noise.
All right, settle down.
Our first act calls himself a star on the rise.
Let's hear it for Damian.
Don't look at me.
Every day is so wonderful
I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
Maybe she forgot about you.
Yeah, Regina has been acting kind of weird lately.
I mean, is something bothering her?
Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean.
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Yes, words can't bring me down
Don't you bring me down today
I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane?
She doesn't even like you that much.
Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job.
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Yo, yo, yo
All you sucker MCs Ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my lines You can't touch Kevin G
I'm a Mathlete So nerd is inferred
But forget what you heard I'm like James Bond the Third
Shaken not stirred I'm Kevin Gnapoor
The G is silent when I sneak in your door
And make love to your woman On the bathroom floor
I don't play it like Staggy You'll know it was me
Because the next time you see her She'll be like
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.
Happy holidays, everybody.
K.G. And the Power of Three.
That was something.
Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
Shut up.
Damn.
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.
But I'm always on your left.
That was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
But the whole dance will be backwards.
I'm always on your left.
And right now you're getting on my last nerve.
Switch.
And finally, please welcome to the stage
Santa's Helpers doing "Jingle Bell Rock".
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing Up bustels of fun
Now the jingle top has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing In Jingle Bell Square
In the fr...
Jason?
What a brigth time It's the rigth time
To rock the nigth away
Jingle bell time Is a swell time
To go riding in a one-torse sleigh
Giddyap jingle torse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
That was the best it ever went!
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.
Cady's blushing.
Oh, my God.
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.
That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
Mathletes?
You hate math.
Look how red she is.
You love him.
And he totally complimented you.
That is so fetch.
Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen.
It's not going to happen.
Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet?
What's so great about Caesar?
Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.
OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar.
People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar.
And when did it become OK for one person to be the boss of everybody?
Because that's not what Rome is about!
We should totally just stab Caesar!"
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.
OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.
You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right?
Yeah.
Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore.
And then for my Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops.
And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad.
And you know she cheats on Aaron?
Yes.
Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep.
But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's secret had put the plan back in motion.
After Christmas break, we tried every Thursday to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
My purse!
Looks like he's headed for the projection room above the auditorium!
Coach Carr?
Trang Pak?
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
Guys, why did we think we could do this?
We're amateurs.
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.
What are Kälteen bars?
They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars.
My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.
They're these weird nutrition bars my mom uses to lose weight.
Give me it.
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
Yeah, you know, there's some weird ingredient in them that's not legal in the U.S. yet.
- Ephedrine?
- No.
- Phentermine.
- No.
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
You're so skinny.
Shut up.
The weird thing about hanging out with Regina was that I could hate her, and at the same time,
I still wanted her to like me.
OK.
You have really good eyebrows.
- Thanks.
- Move.
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back.
Ste knew it was better to be in The Plastics, hating life than to not be in at all.
Because being with The Plastics was like being famous.
People looked at you all the time, and everybody just knew stuff about you.
That new girl moved here from Africa.
I saw Cady Heron wearing Army pants and flip-flops, so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.
That Cady girl is hot.
She might even be hotter than Regina George.
I hear Regina George is dating Aaron Samuels again.
The two were seen canoodling at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.
They've been inseparable ever since.
I was a woman possessed.
I spent about 80 percent of my time talking about Regina.
And the other 20 percent of the time,
I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her more.
She's not even that good-looking if you really look at her.
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
I could hear people getting bored with me.
But I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.
I have this theory that if you cut all her hair off, she'd look like a British man.
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.
Hey, I'm having an art show.
So why don't you take a night off from your double life.
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.
What is that smell?
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.
You smell like a baby prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse I could to talk to Aaron.
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?
Nice job, Cady.
Kind of seems like you get it.
If I was gonna keep this going, I was gonna have to really commit.
Not your best.
Damn, Africa, what happened?
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.
You know, I think I need a tutor.
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
Do you think Regina would mind?
No.
You guys are friends.
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
So, what did you get for this one?
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got one.
- There you go.
I got one too.
Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
Yeah, like negative four and negative six.
That's right.
That's good.
Well, you're a good tutor.
Man, look, I...
I can't do this.
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?
Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?
Look, there's good and bad to everybody.
Right?
Regina's just...
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no.
It was coming up.
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...
She's cheating on you!
What?
Did he say why?
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
Who?
He said some guy on the baseball team.
Baseball team?
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.
You wanna do something fun?
You wanna go to Taco Bell?
I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet.
God, Karen, you are so stupid!
Regina, wait.
Talk to me.
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.
You're not stupid, Karen.
No.
I am, actually.
I'm failing almost everything.
Well, there must be something you're good at.
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.
Wanna see?
No.
That's OK.
Anything else?
I'm kind of psychic.
I have a fifth sense.
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.
My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, they can tell when it's raining.
I have to admit, I was mildly horrified when Aaron didn't immediately ask me to be his girlfriend.
I mean, I know he was sad, but how much time did he need?
Regina had moved on.
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?
A condom?
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.
But overall, the plan was going pretty well.
Aaron had dumped Regina, and she was unknowingly eating 5,000 calories a day.
It was time to turn our attention to the army of skanks.
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows:
Regina George.
Gretchen Wieners.
Janis Ian.
What is happening to the world?
And the final nominee...
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.
... is Cady Heron.
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.
I didn't put you in there.
You mean I'm really nominated?
In January, Regina had put a Spring Fling dress on hold at a store called 1-3-5.
But being Plastic, she needed our advice before she could actually buy it.
Can someone zip me up?
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.
OK, it must be marked wrong.
Cady, all I've been eating are these Kälteen bars.
They suck.
No, no, this is just how they work.
This is all your water weight.
First you bloat, and then you drop 10 pounds like that:
Well, the Kälteen bars have burned up all your carbs, and now your body's just running on water.
But once the water's gone, then you'll be all muscle.
It explains it all on the label.
You know Swedish?
Yeah, everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
Sorry.
We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.
You could try Sears.
Cady.
I need your parents to sign this so they know that you're failing.
Failing?
You know what's weird about your quizzes, Cady, is that all the work is right and just the answers are wrong.
- Really?
- Really.
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend may seem like the most important thing in the world right now, but you don't have to dumb yourself down to get guys to like you.
- How would you know?
- I know,
"How would I know", right?
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.
The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa.
And you know why?
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.
I pushed myself into working three jobs.
And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do for extra credit, please let me know.
Oh, I will.
I hate her!
I mean, she's totally failing me on purpose because I didn't join those stupid Mathletes!
She was so queer.
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."
What does that even mean?
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.
She said she works three jobs.
You know, I bet she sells drugs on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.
You let it out, honey.
Put it in the book.
I know it may look like I'd become a bitch, but that's only because I was acting like a bitch.
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?
Oh, I got busy.
Sorry.
So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
No.
I have to go to Madison with my parents.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
Can't.
I'm doing major Plastic sabotage tonight.
But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
Oh, I planned this one on my own.
Love you.
Bye.
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her because she's running for Spring Fling Queen.
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.
I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something.
And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown.
And who's gonna have to take care of her?
Me.
So you don't think anyone will vote for her?
Cady, she's not pretty.
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.
The Spring Fling Queen is always pretty.
And the crazy thing is is that it should be Karen, but people forget about her because she's such a slut.
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.
Well, she's not mad at you.
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
- No.
- What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
What are you...?
Hold on.
Other line.
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.
- Hello?
- Let's go out.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.
It's Regina.
She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
Do not hang out with her.
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.
You can tell me.
Hold on.
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
Who is?
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.
Right.
Hold on.
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know.
Just get rid of her.
OK.
What is it?
Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
She said that?
You didn't hear it from me.
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever.
She has a right to know.
I can't go out.
I'm sick.
Boo.
You whore.
Regina, we have to talk to you.
Is butter a carb?
Yes.
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.
It's Monday.
- So?
- So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.
They were real that day I wore a vest.
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!
These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.
Fine.
You can walk home, bitches.
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
Gretchen and Karen followed me around all afternoon.
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?
Oh, I have to go to Madison with my parents.
What...?
We have tickets for this thing.
- What?
- What?
Was I the new queen bee?
I can try and get out of it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I told my friend Janis I'd go to her art show.
We've had these tickets for months.
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
But she's my friend, and I made her a promise.
I think Cady's old enough to spend one night on her own.
I had learned how to control everyone around me.
Hey.
I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.
- Is Regina going?
- No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, byotch.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.
I love that shirt on you.
Aaron Samuels was going to be in my touse at my party.
Everything had to be perfect.
And this time when Aaron saw me,
I wouldn't be caught in some ridiculous costume.
Hey, guys.
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!
I know, right?
OK, so I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people.
Do you think that's enough?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
It was not enough.
Somehow, the word had gotten out about my small get-together.
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
He's just using her to make you mad.
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.
Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
- Do I know you?
- Deek!
What up, dog?
She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me?
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.
I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
Jason.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever.
- I love you.
- I know, I know.
Hey!
Put that down!
Was Aaron blowing me off?
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.
- Oh, no.
- Look,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
I have to pee.
Get out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Me too.
You look...
- New clothes?
- Thanks.
You wanna go downstairs?
No, no.
Let's stay here.
Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina.
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.
I know, I know.
Although...
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once, but you're totally gonna laugh when I tell you, so...
Tell me what?
I pretended to be bad at math so that you'd help me.
But the thing is, I'm not really bad at math.
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?
Wait.
You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.
No.
Not on purpose.
Just, you know...
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.
So why didn't you just talk to me?
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.
Because you were her property...
- Her property?
- No.
Shut up.
Not her property...
No, don't tell me to shut up.
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?
You are just like a clone of Regina.
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...
Oh, no.
It was coming up again.
Word vomit.
No, wait a minute...
- What is this?
!
- Actual vomit.
Aaron!
Aaron, wait!
Just...
OK.
Call me.
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.
Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore.
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
Did you have an awesome time?
Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
You're the one who made me like this so you could use me for your eighth-grade revenge.
God!
See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean.
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys."
You know what?
It's not my fault you're in love with me or something!
- What?
!
- Oh, no she did not!
See?
That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.
He broke up with Regina and guess what.
He still doesn't want you.
So why are you still messing with Regina, Cady?
I'll tell you why.
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!
Here.
You can have this.
It won a prize.
And I want my pink shirt back!
I want my pink shirt back!
Hon, slow down.
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.
Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
What?
They make you gain weight like crazy.
Mother...
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch
I've ever met.
Do not trust her.
She is a fugly slut!
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.
Is this true?
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?
Good Lord.
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?
Fat whore.
OK, calm down, Miss George.
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.
Don't worry, we're gonna find out who did it.
There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges.
You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other.
But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia.
And die.
Coach Carr.
Cady Heron, they wanna see you in the principal's office.
All right, chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In here, Miss Heron.
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.
I mean, yes, I've seen it before, but it's not mine.
You better get your story straight, Miss Heron, because I'm not messing around here.
It's not ours, it's Regina's.
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
Miss Wieners, why would Regina refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?
Miss Smith, this is no time to be laughing.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now.
Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us.
And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked.
And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
"Made out with a hot dog"?
Oh, my God, that was one time!
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?
Who wouldn't write that?
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle down!
All right, hey.
No.
You do not push and sh...
Do you have anything else you wanna say?
No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
Miss Smith?
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
I hope that nobody else ever does see it.
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.
- "Too gay to function"?
!
- Hey!
That's only OK when I say it.
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!
Yeah!
Take your top off!
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.
It was full-tilt jungle madness.
And it wasn't going away.
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
Coach Carr, step away from the underage girls.
Let me help you down there.
Hell, no!
I did not leave the Southside for this!
Oh, crap!
My hair!
All junior girls report to the gymnasium immediately!
Immediately!
Have you ever walked up to people and realized they were just talking about you?
Have you ever had it happen 60 times in a row?
I have.
Never in my 14 years as an educator have I seen such behavior.
And from young ladies.
I got parents calling me on the phone asking, "Did someone get shot?"
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.
No!
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?
Now, I'm not gonna do that, because we've already paid the DJ.
But don't think that I'm not taking this book seriously.
Coach Carr has fled school property.
Ms. Norbury has been accused of selling drugs.
Now, what the young ladies in this grade need is an attitude makeover.
And you're gonna get it right now.
I don't care how long it takes, I will keep you here all night.
We can't keep them past 4.
I will keep you here until 4.
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix the way you young ladies relate to each other.
OK?
Lady to lady.
So who has a lady problem that they'd like to talk about?
Yes?
Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons.
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
Yeah, I can't do this.
Ms. Norbury.
You're a successful, intelligent, caring, graceful woman.
I am?
There has to be something you can say to these young ladies.
Something to help them with their self-esteem?
It's not a self-esteem problem.
I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves.
OK.
OK.
Everybody close your eyes.
I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.
Open your eyes.
Now, close your eyes again.
And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back.
Open them.
There's been some girl-on-girl crime here.
OK.
So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way.
Let's start over here.
Ms. Norbury had us confront each other directly about the things that were bothering us.
And it seemed like every clique had its own problems.
You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder.
And Dawn agrees with me.
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,
I'm pitching tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school?
And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
That's probably true.
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
Good.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Cady.
Do you have anything you wanna own up to?
Yes.
No.
You never made up a rumor about anybody?
Just that you sell drugs.
No.
Nothing you want to apologize for?
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury without getting blamed for the whole Burn Book.
No.
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.
OK, so we're all here because of this book, right?
Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores.
It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.
Who here has ever been called a slut?
OK, everybody up.
Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies to people that we'd hurt in our lives.
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch."
"It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed."
"Gretchen,
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea"
"at Barnes and Noble."
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat.
You're fat because I hate you.
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school.
I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
She doesn't even go here!
Do you even go to this school?
No.
I just have a lot of feelings.
OK, go home.
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
I feel like I'm getting through.
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me.
But I can't help it that I'm popular.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off.
Walk it off.
OK.
That hurt.
They're OK.
They're OK.
Oh, boy.
OK, who's next?
Who's next?
Keep it going.
Oh, my God.
It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.
So I have this friend who is a new student this year.
And I convinced her that it would be fun to mess up Regina George's life.
So I had her pretend to be friends with Regina, and then she would come to my house after and we would just laugh about all the dumb stuff Regina said.
And we gave her these candy bar things that would make her gain weight, and we turned her best friends against her.
And then...
Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.
She made out with Regina's boyfriend and then convinced him to break up with her.
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream instead of face wash.
God!
I am so sorry, Regina.
Really, I don't know why I did it.
I guess it's probably because I've got a big lesbian crush on you.
Suck on that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.
Regina, please!
Regina, stop!
No!
Do you know what everyone says about you?
They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me.
Yeah.
So don't try to act so innocent.
You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...
And that's how Regina George died.
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.
Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around.
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.
- Everybody done?
- No.
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?
I don't know.
This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
Who are you?
Great.
All my friends hate me, and now my mom hates me.
Your mom does not hate you.
She's afraid of you.
I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon.
Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
No.
Only thing worse than going back will be not going back.
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
Remember when we saw those lions fighting over the wart hog carcass?
I'll be the wart hog.
You're not a wart hog, you're a lion.
Just focus on your studies for a little while.
You're still an excellent student, right?
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.
- Why?
- I'm failing.
OK.
You are...
What do they call it?
Grounded.
You're grounded.
She pushed her in front of the bus.
Did you see her do it?
Yes.
Did your teacher ever try to sell you marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.
I know, Aaron.
But after the allegations against Coach Carr turned out to be extremely true, the school board felt that it was best that we investigate every claim made in this Burn Book.
That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
Well, unless someone wants to come forward and say, "I made it all up", this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...
Oh, no.
Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.
Mr. Duvall.
I wrote it.
Come on, Cady.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out.
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.
I started with Regina, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get.
Then there was Ms. Norbury, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Oh, hi.
Did you wanna buy some drugs?
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait.
I'll grade it right now.
I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year.
How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
A lot.
You didn't write that whole book yourself.
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?
No, because I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs.
That's all right.
Gething hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
Ninety-four.
Welcome back, nerd.
Thanks.
Anyway I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
But as my own personal form of punishment,
I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
What's up?
Excellent.
Great turnout this year.
- All right.
It's all you.
- OK.
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.
- You nervous?
- Yes.
Don't be.
You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship.
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.
Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.
That is correct.
Question number two.
Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12.
The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...
- Marymount?
- 741.
- Correct.
- Shoot.
I was really rusty.
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.
She's grounded.
Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people.
These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
I'm voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.
She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie.
In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round.
Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent.
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude.
The girl.
Contestant Krafft.
From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
We pick the girl too.
And from North Shore, Miss Cady Heron.
It's Cady.
Oh, my God, that's me.
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously needed to pluck her eyebrows.
Her outfit looked like it was picked out by a blind Sunday school teacher.
And she had some 99-cent lip gloss on her snaggletooth.
And that's when I realized, making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn't stop her from beating me in this contest.
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier.
Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter.
And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier.
All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap.
I lost.
That answer is incorrect.
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
Limits.
Why couldn't I remember anything about limits?
Limits.
That was the week Aaron got his hair cut.
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.
What was on the board behind Aaron's head?
If the limit never approaches anything...
The limit does not exist.
The limit does not exist!
Our new state champions,
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!
How do you like me now?
You like that?
Yeah!
Get some!
Get some!
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.
Thanks, K.G.
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these when we roll into Spring Fling.
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang.
Did you just say "thang"?
Cady, you don't have to punish yourself forever.
But I'm grounded.
You're already out.
All right, do we have all of our nominees for king and queen on the stage?
OK, good.
I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
And I could not be happier that this school year's ending.
Here we go.
The winner of the Spring Fling King,
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
And your Spring Fling Queen, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,
Cady Heron.
Where is Cady?
There she is.
Thanks.
Well, half the people in this room are mad at me.
And the other half only like me because they think I pushed somebody in front of a bus.
So that's not good.
You know, it's not really required of you to make a speech.
I'm almost done, I swear.
To all the people whose feelings that got hurt by the Burn Book,
I'm really sorry.
You know, I've never been to one of these things before.
And when I think about how many people wanted this and how many people cried over it and stuff...
I mean, I think everybody looks like royalty tonight.
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.
And Emma Gerber, I mean, that hairdo must have taken hours, and you look really pretty.
So why is everybody stressing over this thing?
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...
Share it.
A piece for Gretchen Wieners, a partial Spring Fling Queen.
A piece for Janis Ian.
Seriously, most people just take the crown and go.
And a piece for Regina George.
She fractured her spine, and she still looks like a rock star.
Thank you.
And some for everybody else.
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?
Thanks.
All right, have a good time, everyone.
Look.
I'm a queen.
As am I.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So are we still in a fight?
Are you still an asshole?
I don't think so.
Well, then I guess we're OK.
Oh, my God, I love this song!
I hate this song.
I know this song!
Man candy, stage right.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd make it.
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to present you with two gift certificates...
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.
One gift certificate to the Walker Brothers Pancake House.
Thank you.
Congratulations on winning State.
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.
I thought I was gonna hurl.
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
OK.
Grool.
No.
- What's up?
- Can I help you?
You Puerto Rican?
Lebanese.
I feel that.
In case you're wondering, The Plastics broke up.
Regina's spine healed, and her physical therapist taught her to channel all her rage into sports.
It was perfect because the jock girls weren't afraid of her.
Karen used her special talents to do the morning weather announcements.
Hi.
This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees, and there's a 30 percent chance that it's already raining.
And Gretchen found herself a new clique and a new queen bee to serve.
Aaron went to Northwestern, so I still get to see him on weekends.
And me?
I had gone from home-schooled jungle freak to shiny Plastic to most hated person in the world to actual human being.
Hey.
All the drama from last year just wasn't important anymore.
School used to be like a shark tank, but now I could just float.
Regina.
Finally, Girl World was at peace.
Hey, check it out.
Junior Plastics.
And if any freshmen tried to disturb that peace...
Well, let's just say we knew how to take care of it.
Just kidding.
Come on, Chelsea.
Reach.
You're so close.
Rae, I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
Just a little bit further.
Little bit further.
Almost got it.
Girl, "Mocha Frost." My favorite.
Now I can look good when I'm coming down.
See you at the bottom.
Ooh, maybe we should take the long way to the locker room and avoid, you know...
Yeah, the Jock Block.
There is no way I'm walking through all that looking like all this.
I know.
I mean, my hair's all a mess
I'm, like, really sweaty.
And, FYI, you kind of smell a little.
Actually, you smell a lot.
Uh, just keeping it real, Rae.
Keeping it real.
Hey, Chelsea, I taught you that phrase, okay?
Don't use it against me.
Look.
Eddie hurt his foot.
And it's rock climbing week in gym.
Think there's a connection?
Watch this.
Hey, Eddie, there's, uh, free pizza in the cafeteria!
Free pizza?
!
I mean... ow.
Eddie, it's a wall.
Climb it.
Hey, I don't do heights, okay?
Birds got to fly, fish got to swim and Eddie's got to stay on the ground.
Come on, Eddie.
You're good in, like, every other sport.
Basketball, baseball...
Again, all on the ground.
I made it!
I just saw you climb the wall, okay?
You are going to make it all the way to the top.
Really?
You know what this means?
Glory, I'm healed!
I can walk!
I love that you're psychic.
What's the matter, Eddie?
Afraid of heights?
I hate that she's psychic.
Yep, that's me.
Eddie, I said I was sorry.
Can't you just forget it?
I mean, everybody else has.
Help me.
I'm frozen with fear.
I need my mommy.
That is so funny.
Y'all sound just like me.
On the real.
See what you did?
You know, Eddie, on the bright side after this week, you know wall climbing week will be over and then everyone will forget about it and stop teasing you.
You know, until next year.
That's right, Eddie, look.
They're not taking the wall down until tomorrow.
That's when I must have seen you climb it-- in gym tomorrow.
All right, that's great.
After tomorrow the whole school will know Eddie Thomas is no wimp.
But until then, I think I'm going to take the back way to class.
Give it up for the vision, right?
Bam.
Bam.
Girl, I just had the best vision about you.
I saw you walking down Jock Block looking fine and all eyes were on you.
Oh, really?
Wow, you mean I've got it going on?
Hey, Chelsea... did I teach you that line?
Yeah.
Well, we're going to have to work on that one as well.
Come on.
So, where'd your folks go again?
Jamaica.
They're on their third honeymoon.
Oh, gosh, that's so romantic.
Uh, no, it's not, okay?
On their second honeymoon, we ended up with my brother.
Do you like having your grandma around?
Oh, yeah, she's cool but don't call her "grandma"
'cause she always says
"Cookie, as long as I've got my own teeth
"and my butt's still higher than my knees no one calls me grandma."
All right, come on.
Come on.
Give it up!
Give it up, little man.
Never!
I'm going to touché your little tushy.
That's your grandma?
Hey, I heard that.
Don't use that kind of language around here.
It's Vivian.
Hey, Viv.
Hey, Cookie.
Fight's over, little man.
Here you go.
Woo, did you work up an appetite?
Yup.
Good, 'cause I whipped you up something a little special.
Say hello to your great uncle Earl.
Got you.
You wait.
I'm going to get you back.
Well, bring it on, little man.
Bring it on.
Hey, Viv
I want you to meet my bestest friend, Chelsea.
Oh, nice to meet you, Chelsea.
Yeah, she has a date with destiny.
Well, hey, a date's a date.
Honey, we got to get you out of that plaid and into something bad.
Here you go.
Voila.
Wow, all my grandma carries in her purse are old mints and used tissues.
Well, you never know when they're going to ask you to put on a...
Show!
Okay, time to get you dressed.
Do you like these boots?
Oh, I love those.
Good, I think I wanted to wear these tomorrow.
Um, these are the ones that I saw you in, girl.
The Jock Block is going to love them.
Wait a minute.
How 'bout a hat?
I wore this little number when I sang for the troops.
Wow, the Army?
Nope, the Cub Scouts.
Honey, I was one hot-looking den mother.
Hey, Viv.
Yeah?
Yeah, come back.
I've got to get Chelsea into a fly outfit.
I love when Raven has her visions about me.
Oh, I remember when she was a baby.
She used to stop and stare into space with this real serious look on her face.
Oh, she was having one of her visions?
Nope, taking a poop.
Her vision face was more like this--
Hey, Viv.
Yeah, sharing time's over.
What do you think of this?
Viv... you look tired.
Come sit.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet, but I...
I think I'm going...
I'm going to sneeze...
Got you.
What is taking you so long?
Lacing these boots.
Next time, could you buy some with zippers?
Okay, maybe this will help you move a little faster.
I was just walking down Jock Block-- three words, okay?
Look ing good.
Must get on...
Yeah, you thought Jordan's comeback was big?
Well, in five minutes
Eddie Thomas is climbing that wall again.
Go ahead, read up.
Go on, read, read, read.
Thomas are you sure you want an audience for this?
You bet he does.
Does this look like a man who can't take on a challenge?
That's his head, but that's not his body.
Well, does that look like the head of a man who can't take on a challenge?
Yeah, what she said.
I'm so proud of you.
No fear of heights is going to keep my boy down.
You know what, I'll be there as soon as Chelsea's finished.
Good luck.
I don't need it as long as I got my psychic friend.
# Here we go #
# Take me higher #
# Now, how about this?
#
# Here we go #
# Take me higher #
Chelsea...
Walk with me, walk with me.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Their eyes were, like, glued to me.
Yeah, and, um, so is that.
What?
Okay, um, please tell me you just put this there.
Well, girl, you know you look hot.
From the front.
How could you do this, Rae?
That was the Jock Block.
Thanks a lot.
No, but it's not my fault.
Chelsea, it's these...
it's these stupid visions.
Girl, they keep messing up everybody.
I mean, first it's Eddie and now you.
Oh, no.
Eddie.
Eddie.
Raven.
All right, you guys, break it up.
There's nothing left here to see.
Moving on, move on.
Here, let me help you.
No, I'll do it.
I think you already helped enough.
Man, I'm the biggest joke in the school now.
Man, your visions are whack.
Why can't you just be more...
Normal?
Hi.
You know, I was looking for you guys in the cafeteria and then, you know, I thought where would two people who hate me go?
And here you are.
These must be the hate-me stairs.
Ooh, and those must be the other hate-me stares.
Get it?
The stairs and then the hate-me stares?
Right.
You guys, look what am I supposed to do?
Okay, you don't want me to tell you my visions.
What do you want me to do?
go on some type of psychic strike or something?
Sounds good to me.
Yeah, no more visions.
Unless a piano is about to fall on my head.
Then you can tell me.
I mean...
Or you can just keep it to yourself.
Okay, so...
Starting today
I will no longer tell you my visions.
Friends?
Friends.
Friends.
I love y'all.
If I get hit by a piano
I'm blaming you.
Okay, I'm next.
Which one do you think I should sing?
This one I always sing but this one has that really high note that Vivian's been helping me with.
I think, uh...
Uh...
Go for the high note, right?
Your choice.
Great.
Hi.
Chelsea Daniel.
# Amazing grace, how sweet the sound #
# That saved a wretch like me #
Hey, Eddie.
Yeah.
Never mind.
Ah, there's nothing like roasting marshmallows over a campfire.
Hey, come on, cookie, smile.
You used to like camping out in the living room when you were little.
What's going on, kid?
Can we talk about it later?
Sure.
It's later.
Now talk.
It's these visions-- I hate them.
I know exactly how you feel.
No one knows how I feel-- not even my friends.
Sometimes I feel like I'm some kind of freak or something.
Do you feel like if you tell your friends your visions and it doesn't work out, that it's all our fault?
And if you don't tell them and bad stuff happens it's still your fault?
And more than anything you just wish you were normal?
That's exactly how I feel but I've never told anyone that before.
How could you know?
Grandma, are you psychic?
Well, I don't know who this grandma person is but Viv is.
How do you think I knew what Corey was up to with his whoopie cushion?
As a matter of fact, he's on his way downstairs right now with a couple of water balloons.
Corey, don't even think about it!
Oh, man!
I wish I could just stay in this tent forever and never come out.
Been there.
That is not the answer.
Just a minute.
Got to have my sound effects.
You know, cookie being psychic is a gift.
It's what makes us special.
And you're a lucky girl to have friends you can share it with.
But if I keep sharing, I'm not going to have any friends.
Cookie... good friends don't go away that easy.
Thanks.
Ah, for what, sweetie?
Telling me that you're psychic.
Now I know I'm not the only one.
And if you ever need to talk you can always call.
Of course, I'll know it's you before I pick up.
'Cause you'll have a vision?
No, I got caller ID.
Get with the program, kid.
And answer that phone.
Hello.
What?
!
Okay, okay, I'll be right there.
What's wrong?
And you call yourself a psychic.
Eddie, what are you doing up there?
!
Well, I think I'm climbing a wall but I've got my eyes shut.
Okay, I'm going to open them now.
Yep.
I'm on a wall.
Eddie, who are you doing this for?
Everybody's gone home.
I don't care, Chels.
I'm doing this for me.
Eddie, be careful.
Move slowly, okay?
Okay.
Okay, now, hurry.
Hold on.
Get it.
I made it!
Yay!
Now come down.
Yay, Eddie.
That was good.
That was my vision.
Yeah, and I love your visions.
Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em.
Yeah.
Man, you guys sure are tiny.
Oh, we've got you.
We've got you.
Don't worry.
Move over, now!
One, two, three!
This is way better.
Okay, guys, listen.
The trick is to stay calm.
I'll be okay as long as I stand on this rock thing.
You guys, this is all my fault again.
Listen, if you want to drop me as a friend
I totally understand.
What?
You just climbed up a wall to save my butt, Rae.
You don't drop friends like that.
But...
I'm still going to have visions.
So what, Rae?
Come on.
Sure, they're going to mess us up sometimes, you know and we're going to get really mad and act like we hate you but, well, that's what friends do.
We're not going anywhere.
Yeah.
We all got our stuff.
I mean, you may not notice about me but I'm scared of heights.
I feel a group hug coming on.
I love you guys.
Oh, man, I love you, too.
I'd love to get down.
Oh...
Hey!
Hey, Viv!
Hey, Coach.
Thought I might find you here, Cookie.
How'd she know we were here?
Oh, because me and Viv, we're like this.
Can't we just leave her up there?
I mean, this is like a dream come true.
Keep dreaming, little man.
Come on, pull.

Eddie, what do I do?
Look, Rae, there's one other thing you can do.
Wait, hold on...
Do you carry a lunch box?
!
You get right... okay.
And, action.
No.
Mouth... mouthwash.
You should keep that.
He went in my shirt, oh, God.
Eddie, what do I do?
I'm sorry.
He's in my shirt!
Help!
Eddie, what do I do?
There's one other thing you can do, Rae.
You stop smiling!
I'm...
You were laughing and smiled!
Don't smile.
Okay.
Do you carry a lunch box?
!
Um...
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
Eddie, what do I do?
Look, Rae, there's one other thing you can do-- real little.
"Can I come up now?"
- Sorry
- No, I... it's my fault
Nothing is anybody's fault.
Well, good night.
You're beautiful.
- David Fisher.
- Oh my god, David is that you?
I'm sorry could you hold on just a second.
- Hello?
- David?
- Yeah.
- It's Jennifer.
- Hi.
- My father has been killed.
Oh my god I'm so sorry, how did it happen?
He was struked by lightning.
You think that you could..
Do you think you could handle this?
Wow, yeah of course we'll take care of it.
- David are you ok?
- No that's just...
- You sound...
- No hold on , it's just..
it's my mouth guard so I don't grind my teeth when I sleep.
- What the fuck!
- Jennifer's father died.
I can't believe it.
I hope she's married, that way I won't have to feel so guilty for wasting almost two years of her life.
Every woman needs to go through falling in love with a gay man, it's a total female rite of passage...
I mean what about claire and what's-his-face?
Keith don't you ever tell her I told you about that, I'm serious.
It's like every gay men needs to go through a period where he tries to be straight.
I don't think that's a requirement anymore, I think we were maybe the last generation that did that.
How about Claire and what's-his-face?
- So I'm back on Celeste duty today.
- Another talk-show?
Some rehearsal for some charity tomorrow.
What should I wear?
Helmut Lang jeans, black tee-shirt the faded banana republic one with the stretch, and black lace-up boots.
David this is a profession, ok?
There's an image to project.
That image isn't fucking Keith of Finland.
Are you not out on the job?
- No one's ever asked.
- You big whore!
What?
It's not like I'm only defined by being gay, I'm defined by being a lot of things..
- by being black, being american, being...
- Busted!
- You broke up with me because I was not out.
- Oh yeah, to your family!
It's not like I expect to you to come out to every person who walks to the funeral.
Nor do I expect you to come out to every client you have..
Whether it's Celeste or Cameron Diaz or Ian fucking Mckellan.
The people you work with?
Calm down, I'm not the enemy, I'm your lover.
- Thanks Barb, she's never been there before
- Seriously, you've never taken Maya to Legoland?
No she was too young for it until basically now!
I used to love to play with those box when I was a kid, didn't you?
Doesn't Maya love them?
Heu, too young...
small parts... choking.
Oh dear she's still that orally fixated.
Well, no wonder... she was still breastfeeding.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- She just keeps getting bigger every day.
- Yeah, kids kind of do that.
You got me.
- Ah, thanks.
- Uncle Nate?
- Yah.
- Could you be sure and give this to David?
- Yeah sure, ok.
- Tell him that it's from Micheala.
Right.
Ok, so we drop her off on sunday around six or so.
Hey listen, you guys thanks so much for doing this.
If there's anything you ever need that I can...
Well yeah, we do need...
I guess what Hoyd?
A hundred bucks... maybe a hundred and twenty.
For you know Maya share at the hotel and the parking and the restaurant.
Stroller rental!
Of course yeah.
Ah look, could you...
Just take her with you?
- Does Maya like to swim?
- Yeah yeah, she loves it.
She loves it.
Let's say goodbye to daddy, honey.
Bye baby girl, I love you, have a good time.
- Nate?
You're doing ok?
- Yeah, you know..
It comes and goes.
I can appreciate the attempt but I think it looks like something you'd see on a calendar.
Like in some bargain bin somewhere like three month after the new year.
Can you be a little more harsh?
No, it's obviously a stylish calendar in an upscale store.
Ok!
So this piece is no good.
Let's move on!
I think the question is not so much : is this piece good?
I would rather we asked is this piece successful?
Yeah, well this is America, successful equals good.
Successful in achieving it's intention.
- Anita, what was your intent with this piece?
- I don't know.
I liked the way the light was hitting her head.
Do we have to go on every piece knowing exactly what it means?
No but surely it ended up meaning something to you, or you wouldn't have brought it into class.
Oh, I can't believe this!
I thought Arthur was merely excentric, I had no idea he was seriously disturbed.
Kinda brings a new meaning to the term dump-trunk, hu?
Stop fucking it, Samy.
Hey, help me here how many of these guys do you think she fucked?
Man, them faggots too busy fucking each other to ever work her in.
- That's Right.
- Ok.
Hey, Keith what's up, you're coming on the road with us next month?
- Ah, I'm still waiting to hear.
- ...
Johnny, fuck!
Jennifer, I'm so terribly sorry.
David, this my fiancé Greg Sudan.
- Hi Graig, I'm glad to meet you.
- Yeah me too.
Shall we?
He'd been depressed for years, ever since my mom divorced him.
You remember.
Yes.
Will you mother be coming to the funeral?
- No she's...in a nursing home.
- You're kidding she's so young.
Honey I don't mean to rush you but I've got to be back on the site by noon the latest.
So what's going on tour like?
All right.
The thing about Celeste.
Every concert is packed with teenage girls fucking horny out of their minds.
You know what i'm saying?
You'd better make sure you're checking ID's.. find your ass in jail.
Naw, you just gotta make sure you don't videotape nothing.
- What, you're married?
- No, not married but we live together.
Don't do it.
I'm on number three, I can't seem to fucking learn.
I don't wanna play myself.
I wanna play someone ugly or fat.
Something that'll show I could be a serious actress.
Hey, you mind if I ask you a personnal question?
If I do I won't answer it.
How many times a week d'you get your pole wet?
What?
Hey, what?
I'm curious.
It averages out, I guess about five or six times a week.
Damn!
You don't need to go on tour.
What about you?
Once, twice if I'm lucky or if I buy her something.
- That's not good.
- That's so motherfucking not good.
See if you can at least get some free clothes out of it..
These two great black balls of male erotic fury turn to explode on one another.
That's where everyting started.
In those cave painting there was the creation of the idea of image, of the representation of ourselves.
Exactly that's when we stopped living inside nature and started living inside our heads.
Yeah just while we can just sit back and watch while greedy corporate bushsuckers destroy nature, since we're no longer part of it.
If you take humans out of nature then, all there are left with is human nature.
Ok, that sounds really good, but what the fuck does that mean?
Oh, Olivier..
It's no doubt his new assistant.
- I heard you fucked him.
- No, I did not fuck him.
So why did you have to be so mean during my crit you bitch?
Or was that just the new Claire Fisher?
There's a new Claire Fisher?
What was wrong with the old one?
She just waited around for the world to happen to her.
- Hey Jimmy!
- Fuck!
Oh my god I'm sorry, I thought that was gonna be like a charming moment.
Now you want to kill me.
No way.
What good would my life be without you?
Shut up.
- So, Claire Fisher.
- Yes.
Jimmy, I'm not exactly sure I know what you last name is.
I would love to hang out with you.
Say when.
Ok, You're verging dangerously close on being smarmy.
You still haven't answered my question.
Well, I can come over tomorrow afternoon.
But I have to be at home by seven at the latest.
No, that's hardly any time with you at all.
And Nicole misses you.
Well, I miss Nicole too, but I've kids on my own Sophia.
Federico?
Did Arthur leave some sort of forwarding adress?
Ah, no.
I don't think so.
Vanessa, I'm gonna have to call you back ok?
Sweety?
Vanessa?
Oh no he didn't!
He has engaged in a campaign of harrassement against this family.
Ruth I wish you'd let this go.
I have no intention of letting it go, in fact I have a good mind to get the authorities involved.
It's never a good idea.
What do we got here?
Male, sixty, shot by lightning.
What exactly happens to a person when he get struck by lightning?
Well, cardiac arrest is what kills him.
But their insides get fried wherever the current goes, which in this case was his right arm and left leg.
Hence the seperate embaulming.
So he becomes sort of human "fulguré" as it were.
Federico I need to know how to get in touch with Arthur.
Surely there's some way of tracing him.
Ruth, Calm down!
Fine.
I'll just resign myself to receiving excrement in the mail for the rest of my days on this earth.
You little shit!
I'm starting to lose patience with all your sensitive man bullshit.
You're not sensitive, you're a fucking eunuch, a castrato.
- Castrato, I like that.
- You little shit, you don't make jokes.
You take this seriously.
I'd flip you over and spank your candy ass till it bled if I didn't think you'd like it so much.
- I won't...
I promise I won't like it.
- Nice try.
Wonder who that is.
Hey, shut the door.
What?
You don't want somebody to see you all tied up like this?
Too bad because I want the whole world to see what a twisted sister you are, freak.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Thought you'd might be up for a grab and a movie or a bite or something.
Maya is at her aunt Barb, they went to Legoland and I'm going kinda stir crazy.
Just need to be with somebody I think.
I just ordered out for pizza, that's who I thought you were the pizza guy.
I like pizza.
Bad timing.
- I guess I should have called.
- No, Nate.
Stay.
You can meet him.
- Ok.
- Just give me a few minutes.
- I just don't know if he's the right guy for her.
- At least he has sex with her.
I had sex with her.
Oh right, You're the stud because you've had sex with more women that i have.
Well, you're like almost heterosexuel.
What's up with you?
I don't know it's weird at work.
I feel like Sarah Jane from Imitation Of Life.
Makes me Troy Donahue, ok this fits.
But there's this side of me that feels all puffed up because everybody thinks I'm straight.
It's like, I feel like I'm 15 years old all over again.
I mean , how fucked up is that?
In a culture that consistantly puffs up men for being straight not very.. but Keith you have to come out.
David that's my decision.
You are the last person I ever expected to turn into a self-loathing homo.
Wait, I'll get that.
Keith Charles.
Dwayne, word up?
11 am, I know, 2 venti soya lattes, yeah later.
Bitch!
Just because I'm the new guy, I'm their fucking waitress.
So now I can't answer the phone in my own house.
No don't be silly, I'll just make sure they always call me on my cell.
David look, if they take me on tour, I can make a hundred fucking bucks an hour, ok?
And that's for us.
Hi you've reached David and Keith but we can't come to the phone right now because we're too gay.
So after watching this thing like a hundred times,
I decided well I'm gonna, I'm gonna do this scare crow for her, so I'm dancing around you know, doing the thing, and I'm throwing myself around like a rag doll, she's laughting her head off,and the next thing I know,
she starts doing the same thing, and she's throwing herself out, and I can just see her like cracking her head open on the edge of a coffe table or something, and that's, that's how you go from feeling like your super dad to the village fucking idiot, you know..
Parenthood is such a huge fucking responsibility,
- aren't you ever, you know, terrified?
- Yeah, but, I just remind myself that, some things in my life, I just don't have any power over, and I never will,
I don't know, 'cause fear is no good, I don't know, fear can take over your life.
And I still feel like Lisa is.. around, pushing me to move on, wants me to... but you can't, you can't rush it.
- I should go.
- Oh...
- Nice to meet you Joe.
- Yeah, you too, take care.
- You're alright to drive?
- Yeah yeah!
Yeah, I can't believe I was the only one drinking, you guys made me feel like such a lowlife.
- Be good to yourself.
- Yeah, ok, I will.
The guy is seriously wounded!
I'd put like one of those lamp shades around his head you know, like they put on dogs so they don't,
- chew on their stitches!
- I know,
I felt like I couldn't, turn him away, sorry.
No, no no no, no, I love having your ex boyfriend invited in when I'm dressed up in the other room like a christmas ham!
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I thought that was hot!
- Really?
- Yeah, very hot!
Hey buddy!
Hello!
What you doing?
So long!
What is it?
Hey budyboy.
What's up, he?
What are you doing, he?
What are you doing, he?
Lisa?
- Mmmm, oh oh, incoming!
- Is Celeste in there?
- Who wants to know?
- Nancy Frymar, I'm chairwoman of this event.
Please, stand back from the door.
- Hi Celeste, I'm...
- We have a problem,
- Yes I know that's why I'm here...
- I bring my own hair make-up people, it's in my contract.
Yes but we were unaware that their would be a three thousand dollar fee for...
Hey!
These people work hard!
We're actually trying to raise money for people with anticoagulative blood disorders...
Right, and that's why I'm here for free.
I'm totally commited to this,
Luccine and Phillys however are not as rich as I am, and therefore cannot afford to work for free.
- Perhaps a more reasonnable...
- This problem needs to be resolved before I go on stage, alright?
Otherwise, I don't.
Fine, but might I just say, I think you're a gigantic bitch, and I will no longer allow my daughters to listen to your music...
I'm sorry you're either trying to weasel out of what you agreed to, or were too stupid to even read it, and I'm the bitch?
- Trollop...
- Jesus some people are tensed!
- Keith?
- That's right.
- You peed in my john?
- I did, and I apologize.
I used to be a cop, I'm kinda new to this.
I'm a little weird about my bathroom.
What the hell is so funny?
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Y'got your head so far up Celeste's ass!
I was not!
Good boy!
Ah, I've been expecting you.
I have many messages for you.
Yeah...
What's my name?
They don't tell me your name, just that you've lost a lot, and that your heart has been broken.
Yeah, who's they?
An older man, who watches over you, your father, your grandfather?
He was very unhappy in life.
The other one is a woman I think.
Can't be sure.
Sit!
Ah!
You have a lot to work out in this life, too much for one life.
- You will have many lives.
- Right.
Listen I think I ought to go, no offense I just think this is a huge ball of crap!
So...
She's not gone.
She's trying to get to you.
She just doesn't know how.
She is... who is?
I see a woman, I see water.
- She thinks you stopped loving her.
- But I only started loving her.
But I wanted to love her, the way she deserved to be loved.
- You still can.
- She's dead.
She isn't dead.
She's trying to get back to you.
She loves you.
- Try to understand what I'm going through!
- I am trying!
But it's never enough!
My older brother dies when I'm ten, my mother develops alzeimer's really early, the love of my life turns out to be gay,
and my dad gets struck by a lightening!
Why did all this happen to me?
I don't know...
- But I do know, that you...
- Don't you fucking take my hand!
Are you serious?
You fucking broke my heart and stomped on it!
Now I'm such a fucking idiot!
I went out of my way to make it easier for you!
Because you wanted to suck cock!
I was so fucking in love with you!
Fucking sadist!
You make me sick!
I hate that you're gay.
I fucking hate it!
You don't hate that I'm gay you hate that I lied to you.
You should hate that.
I lied to myself too.
Are you sure you like it?
How can I not like the first piece of furniture we've purchased together as a couple?
It will be nice to have a place to display my rock collection.
I spoke to a lawyer today about pressing charges against Arthur.
Oh shit...
Look Ruth, Arthur never sent us any excrement.
- Then who did?
- My son!
That toy truck was something I bought him.
It's the only thing I ever bought him!
- Actually before he was even born.
- Brian?
- Kyle.
- I thought your son's name was Brian?
I have another son.
- Why have you never told me this?
- Because he's never really been part of my life!
If he's sendind us shit in the mail, he is a part of your life!
No he isn't, I was very young, his mother and I never even married!
Her family didn't think I was suitable.
- So you just left?
- He wasn't born yet.
I was very young!
Nobody wanted me to be part of his life!
Are there other wives you've neglected to tell me about?
No, of course not!
Art is a just a sentimental construct to alleviate our fear of death.
No, there's no way to even determine what it is that makes art, art.
Much less to teach it.
Hell, it's a goddamn illusion that anyone can be taught anything!
I mean yes we can all be conditioned up to wazoo but, you know, to really learn something, something important.
That always comes from within.
The cunt has spoken.
Now the world sits in silence!
- So why do you teach art then?
- Why?
- 'Cause I need the goddamn paycheck.
- No you don't baby!
Bern left me very well taken care off, all you have to do is just keep making paintings and I'll keep buying them!
Did you know that Olivier taught my son?
- No.
- I'm hot for teacher!
Drink more mum!
Oh darling don't you wanna try the sheraz, it's delicious!
No, I'm good.
You know I read in the paper about a student who allowed some corporation to tatoo its logo on his forehead, and in exchange they paid for his education.
I mean what the hell is that?
Oh, I imagine it's an education for someone who wouldn't normally be able to pay for it himself.
No it's way more than that, I mean my students are all in such a mad rush to become commodities!
But that's always been true for artists!
- Where is your bathroom?
- Straight through there.
To the left.
It's him, he's the one, I can feel it!
- He is the one!
- You're drunk!
Isn't that nice to have someone who's not only great in bed but who's also your intellectual equal?
Just don't fuck it up this time like you always do.
What if she's really not dead?
- Nate they identified her teeth.
- Yeah I know they did!
But what if but some amazing coincidence there's somebody out there who had the exact same work done on the lower jaw as Lisa?
I suppose that could be possible, but I really think the chances are pretty remote!
Yeah but it could be possible, right?
- Are you high?
- No I'm not, not anymore.
Ok, maybe you should just like stay in tonight, and try to chill out.
Ok?
I've gotta go.
I've got a date with the Matthew Barney of LAC Arts!
Even though I'm so not the Bjork of LAC arts!
- All the chicks are hatched and fluffy now!
- Listen to the chip chip!
- It's the chip sound!
- Chip, chip....
Hey baby!
I made some asopao.
Are you hungry?
Oh damn, I had a sandwich at work.
Where're the kids?
Augusto is in bed and Julio is spending the night over at Charlie's house.
I love you Vanessa.
I know that.
- Tell me what you like.
- I like you.
No, tell me what you'd like me to do!
Just do whatever you want and I'll let you know how it works out for me!
Why won't you tell me?
Look, I don't have like a checklist I need to go through!
- D'you like to have your nipple played with?
- Not if we have to talk about it!
Well how else am I supposed to know what to do here Claire?
You're telling me you don't?
Ok, maybe we should just go to the movie.
Maybe I should just go home!
Alright.
You're never gonna learn anything sweetie.
Not in that programm!
How could you possibly learn about councelling in 18 months!
Well after a lifetime of learning how not to do things, maybe I'm a little ahead of the game!
Oh, I just, I just still can't believe you're planning on becoming a shrink!
The irony!
It's superbe!
The real irony is that shrinks are who we hire to straighten out our lives, but invariably they're the ones who are the most fucked up!
I mean twisted!
Demonic!
Well then it makes absolute sense that Brenda would become one!
Ho honey come on, you're never gonna be a good shrink without a sense of humour!
- Do you think you're a good shrink?
- I think I'm a very good shrink!
- Does that mean you're very fucked up?
- Abso-fucking-lutely!
You have no idea!
Darling?
Do you ever hear from Nate?
Yeah, actually we saw him last night.
He's still grieving.
Oh, he showed us pictures of his daughter, oh my god she's so beautiful!
Those eyes!
So open, and trusting!
It is mind boggling to think that we were all like that once!
Ah!
I Get it!
Now this makes sense!
You want a baby!
Where did that come from?
Come on, darling, you are getting a little long in the tooth you know!
This would be the time!
- Oh, Brenda is feeling eggy!
- Ok!
Well it's time for us to go!
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you Jim!
I hope you're up for the challenge of my daughter!
I am, I am, yeah it's Joe!
My name is Joe!
Bye!
See you in a few years!
Terrible evening!
What?
- What time is it?
- Time for you to stop keeping' things from me.
Oh, Ruth!
It sounds absurd when you talk like that.
Ok..
I was just a grad student.
And I...
I accidently knocked up a young woman from a very wealthy family.
I offered to marry her, family was dead set against it.
So, I signed something!
And we both went on with our life.
- What was I supposed to do?
- You've never even seen this child?
Oh Yeah, I've seen him.
He tracked me down a couple of years ago..
He was living in some motel over in Burbank.
And?
I..
I didn't particularly care for him.
As a matter of fact, I found him very unpleasant.
And I... assumed he never wanted to see me again!
Why?
Because he said : "I don't ever wanna see you again!"
Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom!
George, how can you?
I just don't see how..
- I feel like i don't know you at all.
- Ruth, please!
Don't blow this all out of proportion.
Frankly for either one of us.
- Hello?
- Nate?
- Barb?
- It... it's Lisa
- Where are you?
- I don't know they won't tell me
- Well, who won't tell you?
- Nate, the number 3 is not important.
- Wait, what?
- You buried me..
How could you bury me?
- I thought that's what you wanted!
- But I'm not dead
I don't think it's healthy being so disconnected from your own son!
That's why I called him this morning and told him to be expecting us shortly past noon.
- And lucky his number was in your adress book.
- You looked in my adress book without asking me?
Apparently there's still some shred of internal feeling in you!
This is important for me George!
I do not ask you for many things.
Alright!
- Oh, you look terrible!
- And I feel terrible!
I'm worried about you, you're not taking very good care of yourself!
Well, I'm doing the best I can mom, And you pointing out the ways I'm failing doesn't necesseraly help.
I'll be waiting for you in the car!
- Can I ask you something?
- Now may not be the best time, George!
Has you mother always been so...
anxious about everything?
Pretty much..
She's got a lot better since you two got married!
How do you deal with her?
I moved away when I was 17.
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
For if we live, we live unto the Lord;
and if we die, we die unto the Lord;
whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord
Even so saith the spirit, for they rest from their labors.
The lord be with you.
- What?
- Not a very nice way to answer the phone!
This is starting to get weird, ok?
You're not my wife!
I know that.
And I do not want you calling me all the time, you got that?
Of course, I'm sorry!
I..
I didn't think that I...
I don't ever wanna be a problem for you!
George, I have a question for you.
And I want you to answer me honestly.
Ruth, I get the feeling that you think I haven't been honest with you!
But I always have!
I just don't wanna burden you with things that don't matter, that's all!
It's what I would want from you!
What did you wanna ask me?
I have no idea!
- We just wanted to thank you.
- Of course!
Seriously man, thanks!
Jen told me how she unleashed on you!
I think she really needed to do that.
She's been doing it to me mostly.
Which is just making it harder for him to be there for me!
Yes, that's a... scenario I'm familiar with!
The funeral was awesome.
The old guy would have really liked it.
- Ok, I'll go get the car.
- Ok, thanks honey..
Sorry.
I said some pretty terrible things about you.
And most of which were true.
No David.
I know it was hard for you too.
Probably even harder than it was for me.
You're doing it again.
Making it easier for me.
- Some things never change..
- Oh Yeah, well some things need to!
So why didn't you just tell him what you wanted?
Oh, 'cause there was absolutely no way!
I mean, it'd just be too..
- Ew..
Seriously, you'd do that?
- Of course.
Um..
Yeah.
Otherwise they'll never figure it out for themselves, no matter how much porn stars screaming I do!
I just wish they knew how to.. do it on their own.
It's so embarassing..
Well, that's why girls are better!
They know!
No thanks.
I love you, but I'm not into eating pussy, ok?
I tried it once, it was...
mmmh, not for me!
So I'll just have to keep telling stupid guys "point blank".
- Lick my clit while you finger me!
- Oh my God!
This is... ew..
But.. ok..
Last year I went out with this guy Phil,
He was so hot, and he was like so totally into sex, I mean we were always..
Fucking!
I mean, like, always!
But everytime he would, you know, go down on me,
It was like there was this unspoken timelimit
Like, I knew that just when it was starting to get good for me, he was going to look up at me with his lobster eyes like : "Can I come up now?"
So, what makes you cum?
I don't know.. the usual.. stuff!
- Why are we talking about this?
- Y'know, maybe you've never had an orgasm!
Of course I've had an orgasm!
Because if you had, you wouldn't be embarassed about asking for more tongue time.
Could I have really never had an orgasm?
Well, I definitely felt a surge of desire, and then, y'know a sort of relief of that desire!
Oh my God, Claire.
Have you never even rubbed one out?
- You don't masturbate?
- I don't find it that interesting..
You know, Claire, we could um.. show you how to give yourself an orgasm by now if you want.
Um, hello!
Not lesbians!
I really don't think it's possible that I've never had an orgasm!
Well, if you haven't, you're seriously missing out!
I'd like to say : "George has told me a lot about you".
But..
- he really hasn't told me anything at all!
- That's because he doesn't know anything about me!
I know you hate me!
And you seem to blame me for everything you don't like about your life.
Why is he here?
- Oh, this was you're idea?
- Well..
Of course it was her idea!
You made it perfectly clear you never wanted to see me again!
I didn't!
Thanks..
Kyle, look..
We can't change the past!
But maybe we can start fresh, if you're willing to s...
Do you know what you can't do?
You can't walk in here and say : "This is this and that is that"
like you're God.
Because you know what?
You're not God!
You're not even close!
I want all deliveries of excrement to our house to cease!
Yeah, well, I want there to be world peace, but I don't see that happening either!
Why the hell are you so angry at me?
It's your mother you should be angry at!
And your grandparents..
- What is it?
You find my shit offensive?
- No, I find it childish and hostile!
And I'm completely baffled at the timing!
I mean... why now?
Because my therapist says that I need to express my true feelings to you!
- This is a goddamn waste of time!
- George, please!
- Are you alright Kyle?
Do you need anything?
- Like what?
- I don't know...
Clothing, underwear, socks?
- No...
Would you like a cappucino from my 7500 dollars expresso machine?
Which I bought, so I would never have to leave this motel room, because I'm so fucking twisted thanks to you know who!
Thank you, yes, I'd love a cappucino!
I was kidding, I don't even know how to work it yet!
Well, we could all go to Starbucks!
I feel so Sharon Stone!
Do people still do these things when they've had kids?
Yeah some people do..
And some people don't!
I once walked in my parents!
My father was rubbing a rolling pen over my mother's breasts
Is this something you'd like for me to do for you?
Oh, no thank you!
I mean, that fucked me up more than if they'd just been fucking in front of us!
Which they also did by the way!
Sorry!
- That was fun.
- No, it wasn't!
Kyle deliberately spilled his frapuccino all over me
No, it was just that he was so nervous being out in the world!
And my heart goes out to him!
He lives in a motel
Only because he's too damn lazy to change his own sheets!
Ruth, his mother's family comes from major money!
Old, old money!
He doesn't need us!
Children need more from their parents than money!
It's unfortunate that I was cut out of his life, but the fact remains, I was cut out of his life!
And that's not gonna change!
He seems so lonely!
Maybe we should invite him to dinner!
Yeah, sure!
Why not?
Hey, how was the funeral?
It was... awesome!
The old guy would have liked it!
Mmmh, what's this?
That?
That's The Rock!
Well, we'd definitely tap that ass!
- I'm still not out at work!
- Yeah, so...
I thought you were gonna push me to come out!
I don't care about that anymore!
It's boring!
I'd rather not fight!
Ok!
- Did you have fun.. um, did you have fun?
- She had a blast!
I can really see Lisa in her, Nate!
Yeah listen.
Barb, I need to tell you something!
I...
I went to a psychic!
Aha...
Was that helpful?
She said Lisa is still alive!
Jesus Christ!
I don't believe this..
What's wrong with you Nate?
Do you need help?
Because if you do, you should get it and not from a fucking psychic!
I wanna have kids too..
Y'know, or just one.. or several..
And I wanna have them, um.. it...
With you!
I mean I.. never really saw myself as.. or
I never really thought it was possible..
But somehow, ever since we've met..
Everything.. seems..

I'm sorry.
No, it's my fault.
Nothing is anybody's fault.
Well, good night.
You're beautiful.
David Fisher.
Oh my God, David, is that you?
I'm sorry, can you hold on just a second?
- Hello?
- David?
- Yeah?
- lt's Jennifer.
- Hi.
- My father's been killed!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
How did it happen?
He was struck by lightning.
Do you think you can handle it?
Yeah, of course we'll take care of it.
- David, are you okay?
- No, that's just--
- You sound--
- Hold on, it's just... it's my mouth guard, so I don't grind my teeth when I sleep.
What the fuck?
- Jennifer's father died.
- l can't believe it.
I hope she's married.
That way I won't have to feel so guilty for wasting almost two years of her life.
Every woman needs to go through falling in love with a gay man.
It's a total female rite of passage.
What about Claire and what's-his-face?
Keith, don't you ever tell her I told you about that. I'm serious.
Just like every gay man goes through a period where he tries to be straight.
I don't think that's a requirement anymore.
We were the last generation that did that.
What about Claire and what's-his-face?
So I'm back on Celeste duty today.
Another talk show?
Some rehearsal for some charity tomorrow.
What should I wear?
Mm, uh, Helmut Lang jeans, a black t-shirt, the faded Banana Republic one with the stretch, and black lace-up boots.
David, this is a profession, okay?
There is an image to project.
And that image isn't fucking Keith of Finland.
Are you not out on the job?
No one's ever asked.
You big whore.
What, it's not like I'm only defined by being gay.
I'm defined by being a lot of things.
Being black, being American, being--
Busted?
You broke up with me because I was not out!
Yeah, to your family. I don't expect you to come out to every person who walks through the funeral home.
Nor do I expect you to come out to every client you have, whether it's Celeste or Cameron Diaz or lan fucking McKellen.
- But the people you work with--
- Calm down.
I'm not the enemy.
I'm your lover.
Thanks, Barb, she's never been before.
Seriously, you've never taken Maya to LEGOLAND?
No.
She was too young for it until, basically, now?
I used to love to play with those blocks when I was a kid.
Didn't you?
Does Maya love them?
Too young, small parts, choking?
Oh, dear, she's still that orally fixated.
Well, no wonder, she was still breast-feeding when--
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey!
She just keeps getting bigger every day.
Yeah, kids kinda do that.
You got me.
Oh, thanks.
- Uncle Nate?
- Yeah?
Could you be sure and give this to David?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
- Tell him that it's from Michaela.
- Right.
Okay, so we'll drop her off on Sunday around 6:00 or so.
Hey, listen, you guys, thanks so much for doing this.
If there's anything you ever need that l--
Well, yeah, we do need-- l guess, what, Hoyt?
100 bucks, maybe 1 20.
For you know, Maya's share of the hotel, and the parking, and the restaurants...
Stroller rental.
Of course, yeah.
Uh, look, could you just take her?
Does Maya like to swim?
Yeah, yeah, she loves it.
She loves it.
Here you go.
Say goodbye to Daddy, honey.
Hey, bye, baby girl.
I love you.
Have a good time.
Nate, are you doing okay?
Yeah, you know... it comes and goes.
I can appreciate the attempt, but I think it looks like something you'd see on a calendar, like in some bargain bin somewhere, like three months after the new year.
Can you be a little more harsh?
No, it's obviously a stylish calendar, in an upscale store--
Okay, so this piece is no good.
Let's move on.
I think the question is not so much is this piece good?
I would rather we ask is this piece successful?
Yeah, well, this is America, successful equals good.
Successful in achieving its intention.
Anita... what was your intent with this piece?
I don't know.
I liked the way the light was hitting her head.
Do we have to go into every piece knowing exactly what it means?
No, but surely it ended up meaning something to you, or you wouldn't have brought it into class.
Oh.
I can't believe this!
I thought Arthur was merely eccentric.
I had no idea he was seriously disturbed.
Kinda brings new meaning to the term "dump truck," huh?
You're just a legend in your own mind, aren't ya?
Stop marking it, Sammy!
You're never ever gonna be mine, are ya?
Ugh!
Sloppy.
You guys blow!
Hey, Javier.
How many of those guys you think she fucked?
Man, them faggots are too busy fucking each other
- to ever work her in.
- Right?
Yo, K, what's up?
You coming on the road with us next month?
I'm still waiting to hear.
Johnny, you suck!
Jennifer, I'm so terribly sorry.
David, this is my fiancé Greg Sutton.
Hi, Greg. I'm glad to meet you.
- Yeah, me too.
- Shall we?
He'd been depressed for years, ever since my mom divorced him.
Well, you remember.
Yes.
Will your mother be coming to the funeral?
No, she's... in a nursing home.
You're kidding.
She's so young.
Honey, I don't mean to rush you, but I've gotta be back on the site by noon at the latest.
So what's going on tour like?
All right, the thing about Celeste-- every concert's packed with teenage girls fucking horny out of their minds.
You know what I'm saying?
You better make sure you're checking l.D.s or you'll find your ass in jail.
Naw, you just got to make sure you don't videotape nothing.
What, you married?
No, not married, but we live together.
Don't do it.
I'm on number three, and I can't seem to fucking learn.
I don't want to play myself.
I wanna play someone ugly or fat.
Something that'll show I can be a serious actress.
Hey, you mind if I ask you a personal question?
If I do, I won't answer it.
How many times a week do you get your pole wet?
What?
I'm curious.
It averages out, I guess, to about five or six times a week.
Damn.
You don't need to go on tour.
What about you?
Once.
Twice if I'm lucky or if I buy her something.
That's not good.
That is so motherfuckin' not good.
See if you can at least get some free clothes out of it.
These two great black balls of male erotic fury go to explode on one another.
That's when everything started.
From those cave paintings, that was the creation of the idea of "image,"
of the representation of ourselves.
Exactly, and that's when we stopped living inside nature, and started living inside our heads.
Yeah, which is why we can just sit back and watch while greedy corporate Bush-suckers destroy nature, since we're no longer a part of it.
If you take humans out of nature, then all that you're left with is human nature.
Okay, that sounds really good, but what the fuck does that mean?
Oh, Olivier!
That's no doubt his new assistant.
I heard you fucked him.
No!
I did not fuck him.
So why did you have to be so mean during my crit, you bitch?
Or was that just the new Claire Fisher?
There's a new Claire Fisher?
What was wrong with the old one?
She just waited around for the world to happen to her.
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What the fuck?
!
Oh, God, I sorry.
I thought that was going to be like a charming moment,
- but now you want to kill me.
- No way.
What good would my life be without you?
Oh shut up.
So, Claire Fisher.
Yes, Jimmy.
I'm not exactly sure I know what your last name is.
I would love to hang out with you.
Say when.
Okay, you are verging dangerously close on being smarmy.
You still haven't answered my question.
I could come over tomorrow afternoon, but I have to be home by 7:00 at the latest.
No!
That's hardly any time with you at all!
And Nicole misses you.
Well, I miss Nicole too, but I have kids of my own, Sophia.
Federico, did Arthur leave some sort of forwarding address?
Uh, no, I don't think so.
Vanessa, I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, sweetie?
Vanessa?
Oh no, he didn't.
He's engaged in a campaign of harassment against this family!
Ruth, I wish you'd let this go.
I have no intention of letting it go.
I have a good mind to get the authorities involved.
That's never a good idea.
What have you got here?
Male, 60s, struck by lightning.
Oh.
What exactly happens to a person when they get struck by lightning?
Well, cardiac arrest is what kills 'em, but their insides get fried wherever the current goes.
Which in this case, was his right arm and left leg, hence the separate embalming.
So he becomes sort of a human fulgurite, as it were.
Federico, I need to get in touch with Arthur!
Surely there's some way of tracing him.
Ruth, calm down!
Fine.
I'll just resign myself to receiving excrement in the mail for the rest of my days on this earth.
You little shit!
I'm starting to lose patience with all your
"sensitive man" bullshit.
You're not sensitive.
You're a fucking eunuch.
A castrato.
- Castrato, I like that.
- You little shit, you don't make jokes!
You take this seriously.
I'd flip you over and spank your candy ass till it bled if I didn't think you'd like it so much.
I won't, I promise I won't like it.
Nice try.
Huh.
I wonder who that is.
Hey, shut the door.
What, you don't want somebody to see you all tied up like this?
Too bad, because I want the whole world to see what a twisted sister you are.
Freak.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I thought you might be up for grabbing a movie or a bite or something?
Oh.
Maya's with her Aunt Barb.
They went to LEGOLAND.
I'm going kinda stir-crazy.
I just need to be with somebody, I think.
I just...
ordered out for pizza.
That's who I thought you were, the pizza guy.
I like pizza.
Um...
- Bad timing.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, I guess I should have called.
No, Nate-- stay.
You can meet him.
Okay.
Just give me a few minutes.
I just don't know if he's the right guy for her.
At least he has sex with her.
I had sex with her.
Right, you're the stud because you've had sex with more women than I have.
Wow, you're like, almost heterosexual.
What's up with you?
I don't know.
It's weird at work.
I feel like Sarah Jane from "lmitation of Life."
That makes me Troy Donahue.
Okay, this fits.
But there's this side of me that feels all puffed up because everybody thinks I'm straight.
It's like I feel like I'm 15 years old all over again.
How fucked up is that?
In a culture that consistently puffs up men for being straight?
Not very.
But, Keith, you have to come out.
David, that's my decision.
You are the last person I ever expected to turn into a self-loathing homo.
Wait, I'll get that.
Keith Charles.
Duane, what up?
11 :00 A.M. I know...
Two venti soy lattes.
Yeah, later.
Bitch.
Just because I'm the new guy, I'm their fucking waitress?
Now I can't answer the phone in my own house?
No, don't be silly. I'll just make sure they always call me on my cell.
David, look if they take me on tour, I can make 100 fucking bucks an hour, okay?
And that's for us!
Hi, you've reached David and Keith, but we can't come to the phone right now because we're too gay.
So after watching this thing, like, 100 times I decide I'm gonna do the scarecrow for her.
So I'm dancing around, doing the thing and throwing myself around like a ragdoll and she's laughing her head off.
The next thing I know she starts doing the same thing.
She's throwing herself around and I can just see her cracking her head open on the edge of a coffee table or something, and that's how you go from feeling like you're Super Dad to the village fucking idiot.
Parenthood is just such a huge fucking responsibility.
Aren't you ever, you know, terrified?
Yeah, but I just remind myself that some things in my life I just don't have any power over, and I never will.
You know, because fear is no good.
Fear can take over your life.
I still feel like Lisa's around... pushing me to move on, wants me to...
But you can't.
You can't rush it.
Uh, I should go.
- Oh.
- Nice to meet you, Joe.
Yeah, you too.
Take care.
- Are you all right to drive?
- Yeah yeah.
I can't believe I was the only one drinking.
You guys make me feel like such a lowlife.
Well, be good to yourself.
Yeah, okay, I will.
That guy is seriously wounded.
I want to put one of those lampshades around his head, you know, like they put on dogs so they don't chew their stitches.
I know. I felt like I couldn't turn him away.
Sorry.
No no no no, I love having your ex-boyfriend invited in when I'm trussed up in the other room like a Christmas ham.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's hot.
Really?
That's very hot.
Hey, buddy.
Well, hello.
Whatcha doin'?
So long.
What is it?
Hey, buddy boy.
What's up, huh?
How ya doin', huh?
What are you doing, huh?
Lisa?
Uh-oh, incoming.
- ls Celeste in there?
- Who wants to know?
Nancy Freymire.
I'm chairwoman of this event.
Please, stand back from the door.
- Hi, Celeste, I'm--
- We have a problem.
- l know.
That's why I'm here-- - l bring my own hair and makeup people.
It's in my contract.
Yes, but we were unaware that there would be a $3,000 fee--
Hey, these people work hard.
We're actually trying to raise money for people with anticoagulative blood disorders.
Right, and that's why I'm here for free.
I'm totally committed to this.
Lucien and Phyllis, however, are not as rich as I am and therefore, cannot afford to work for free.
Perhaps a more reasonable--
This problem needs to be resolved before I go on stage, all right?
Otherwise, I don't.
Fine, but might I just say I think you're a gigantic bitch, and I will no longer allow my daughters to listen to your music?
I'm sorry.
You're either trying to weasel out of what you agreed to, or were too stupid to even read it, and I'm the bitch?
Trollop.
Jesus, some people are tense.
- Keith?
- That's right.
You peed in my john.
I did, and I apologize.
I used to be a cop.
I'm kinda new to this.
I'm a little weird about my bathroom.
What the hell is so funny?
Sorry, I can't hear you-- you got your head so far up Celeste's ass.
It is not!
Tsk.
Good boy.
I've been expecting you.
I have many messages for you.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
What's my name?
They don't tell me your name, just that you've lost a lot, and that your heart has been broken.
Yeah, who's "they"?
An older man who watches over you, your father?
Your grandfather?
He was very unhappy in life.
The other one is a woman, I think.
I can't be sure.
Sit!
Ahhhh.
You have a lot to work out in this life.
Too much for one life.
You will have many lives.
Right.
Listen, I think I oughta go, no offense.
I just think this is a huge ball of crap, so--
She's not gone.
She's trying to get to you.
She just doesn't know how.
She's--
Who is?
I see... a woman.
I see water.
She thinks you stopped loving her.
But I only started loving her... I wanted to love her... the way she deserved to be loved.
- You still can.
- She's dead.
She isn't dead.
She's trying to get back to you.
She loves you.
- l don't know what to say to you.
- Well, just--
- What can I do?
- You're completely embarrassing me.
If you could even try to understand what I'm going through-- l am trying, but it's never enough!
My older brother dies when I'm 10, my mother develops Alzheimer's really early, the love of my life turns out to be gay, and my dad gets struck by lightning.
Why did all this happen to me?
I don't know.
But I do know that you--
Don't you fucking take my hand.
Are you serious?
You fucking broke my heart and stomped on it.
And I was such a fucking idiot, I went out of my way to make it easier for you?
!
Because you wanted to suck cock!
I was so fucking in love with you, you fucking sadist!
You make me sick!
I hate that you're gay.
I fucking hate it.
You don't hate that I'm gay.
You hate that I lied to you.
You should hate that.
I lied to myself too.
Are you sure you like it?
How could I not like the first piece of furniture we purchased together as a couple?
It'll be nice to have a place to display my rock collection.
I spoke to a lawyer today about pressing charges against Arthur.
Oh, shit.
Look, Ruth, Arthur never sent us any excrement.
- Then who did?
- My son.
That toy truck was something I bought him.
It's the only thing I ever bought him actually, before he was even born.
- Brian?
- Kyle.
I thought your son's name was Brian.
I have another son.
Why have you never told me this?
Because he's never really been part of my life.
If he's sending us shit in the mail,
- he's a part of your life.
- No, he isn't.
I was very young.
His mother and I never even married.
Her family didn't think I was suitable.
- So you just left?
- He wasn't born yet.
I was very young.
Nobody wanted me to be a part of his life.
Are there other wives you've neglected to tell me about?
No!
Of course not.
Art is just a sentimental construct to alleviate our fear of death.
No, there's no way to even determine what it is that makes art art, much less to teach it.
It's a goddamn illusion that anyone can be taught anything.
I mean, yes, we can all be conditioned up the wazoo, but to really learn something, something important?
That always comes from within.
The cunt has spoken.
Now the world sits in silence.
So, why do you teach art then?
Why?
Because I need the goddamn paycheck.
No, you don't, baby.
Bern left me very well taken care of.
All you have to do is just keep making paintings and I'll keep buying them.
Did you know Olivier taught my son?
- No.
- l'm hot for teacher.
Drink more, Mom.
Oh, darling, don't you want to try the Shiraz?
It's delicious.
No, I'm good.
I read in the paper about a student who allowed some corporation to tattoo its logo on his forehead, and in exchange they paid for his education.
What the hell is that?
I imagine it's an education for someone who wouldn't normally be able to pay for it himself.
It's way more than that.
My students are all in such a mad rush to become commodities.
But that's always been true of artists.
Where is your bathroom?
Straight through there, to the left.
It's him!
He's the one.
I can feel it.
He's the one!
You're drunk.
Now, isn't it nice to have someone who's not only great in bed, but who's also your intellectual equal?
Just don't fuck it up this time, like you always do.
Hmm.
What if she's really not dead?
!
- Nate, they identified her teeth.
- Yeah, I know they did.
But what if, by some amazing coincidence, there's somebody out there who had the exact same work done to their lower jaw as Lisa?
I suppose that could be possible, but I really think the chances are pretty remote.
But it could be possible, right?
- Are you high?
- No, I'm not, not anymore.
Maybe you should just, like, stay in tonight and try to chill out.
Okay?
I've to go.
I've got a date with the Matthew Barney of LAC Arts.
Even though I'm so not the Bjork of LAC Arts.
All the chicks are hatched and fluffy now.
Listen to them-- cheep cheep cheep.
Cheep cheep cheep cheep.
Make the chick sound, cheep cheep cheep.
Hi, baby, I made some Asopao.
Are you hungry?
Oh, damn.
I had a sandwich at work.
Where are the kids?
Gusto's in bed, Julio's spending the night over at Charlie's house.
Hmm.
I love you, Vanessa.
I know that.
Tell me what you'd like.
I like you.
No, tell me what you like me to do.
Uh, just do whatever you want, and I'll let you know how it works out for me.
Why won't you tell me?
Look, I don't have, like, a checklist I need to go through.
Do you like to have your nipples played with?
Not if we have to talk about it!
How else am I supposed to know what to do here, Claire?
Are you telling me you don't?
Okay, maybe we should just go to the movie.
Maybe I should just go home.
All right.
You're never gonna learn anything, sweetie.
Not in that program.
How could you possibly learn about counseling in 18 months?
Well, after a lifetime of learning how not to do things, maybe I'm a little ahead of the game.
I just still can't believe you're planning on becoming a shrink.
The irony.
It's superb.
The real irony is that shrinks are who we hire to straighten out our lives, but invariably, they're the ones who are the most fucked up.
I mean, twisted.
- Demonic.
- Ooh.
Well, then it makes absolute sense that Brenda would become one.
Oh, honey, come on now.
You're never gonna be a good shrink without a sense of humor.
Do you think you're a good shrink?
I think I'm a very good shrink.
- Does that mean you're very fucked up?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
Mm, you have no idea.
Darling, do you ever hear from Nate?
Yeah, actually, we saw him last night.
He's still grieving.
Oh, he showed us pictures of his daughter.
Oh my God, she's so beautiful.
Those eyes, so open and trusting.
It's mind-boggling to think that we were all like that once.
I get it!
Now this makes sense.
You want a baby!
Where did that come from?
You are getting a little long in the tooth, you know.
This would be the time.
Aw, Brenda's feeling eggy.
Okay, well, it's time for us to go.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, Jim.
I hope you're up for the challenge of my daughter.
I am.
I am.
It's Joe, not Jim.
Bye, see you in a few years.
Terrible evening.
What?
What time is it?
Time for you to stop keeping things from me!
Oh, Ruth.
It sounds absurd when you talk like that.
Okay.
I was just a grad student, and I... accidentally knocked up a young woman from a very wealthy family.
I offered to marry her.
Her family was dead set against it, so...
I signed something, and we both went on with our lives.
What was I supposed to do?
You've never even seen this child?
Oh yeah, I've seen him.
He tracked me down a couple of years ago.
He was living in some motel over in Burbank.
And?
I didn't particularly care for him.
As a matter of fact, I found him very unpleasant.
And I assumed he never wanted to see me again.
Why?
!
Because he said, "l don't ever want to see you again."
Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
George, how can you-- l just don't see how-- l feel like I don't know you at all.
Ruth, please.
Don't blow this all out of proportion.
It's not good for either one of us.
Oh, God.
- Hello?
- Nate?
- Barb?
- lt's Lisa.
Where are you?
I don't know.
They won't tell me.
Well, who won't tell you?
Nate, the number three is not important.
Wait, what?
You buried me.
How could you bury me?
I thought that's what you wanted.
But I'm not dead.
I don't think it's healthy, being so disconnected from your own son.
That's why I called him this morning, and told him to be expecting us shortly past noon.
I'm lucky his number was in you address book--
You looked in address book without asking me?
- Ruth!
- This is important to me, George.
I do not ask you for many things.
All right.
- You look terrible.
- l feel terrible.
I'm worried about you.
You're not taking very good care of yourself.
I'm doing the best I can, Mom.
You pointing out the ways I'm failing doesn't necessarily help.
I'll be waiting for you in the car.
Nate, can I ask you something?
Now may not be the best time, George.
Has your mother always been so... anxious about everything?
Pretty much.
She's gotten a lot better since you two got married.
How'd you deal with her?
I moved away when I was 17.
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
For if we live, we live unto the Lord.
And if we die, we die unto the Lord.
Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.
Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord.
Even so sayeth the spirit, for they rest from their labors.
What?
!
That's not a very nice way to answer the phone.
This is starting to get weird, okay?
You are not my wife.
I know that.
And I do not want you calling me all the time.
You got that?
Of course, I'm sorry.
I didn't think that I... I don't ever wanna be a problem for you.
George, I have a question for you, and I want you to answer me honestly.
Ruth, I get the feeling you think I haven't been honest with you, but I always have.
I just don't want to burden you with things that don't matter, that's all.
That's what I would want from you.
What did you want to ask me?
I have no idea.
We just wanted to thank you.
Of course.
Seriously, man, thanks.
Jen told me how she unleashed on you.
I think she really needed to do that.
She's been doing it to me, mostly.
Which was just making it harder for him to be there for me.
Yes, that's a scenario I'm familiar with.
The funeral was awesome.
I think the old guy would have really liked it.
Okay, I'll go get the car.
Okay, thanks, hon.
I'm sorry.
I said some pretty terrible things about you.
- Most of which were true.
- No, David.
I know it was hard for you too, probably even harder than it was for me.
You're doing it again.
Making it easy for me.
Some things never change.
Yeah, well, some things need to.
So why didn't you just tell him what you wanted?
Um, because there was absolutely no way.
I mean, it would just be too... ew.
Seriously, you would do that?
- Of course.
- Yeah.
Otherwise they'll never figure it out for themselves, no matter how much porn star screaming I do.
I just wish they knew how to do it on their own.
It's so embarrassing.
Well, that's why girls are better.
They know.
No, thanks. I love you, but I'm not into eating pussy, okay?
I tried it once.
It was, eh, not for me.
So I'll just have to keep telling stupid guys point blank,
- lick my clit while you finger me.
- Oh my God!
But, okay, last year, I went out with this guy Phil.
He was so hot, and he was like so totally into sex, I mean, we were always... fucking, I mean, like always.
But every time he would, you know, go down on me, it was like there was this unspoken time limit.
Like I knew that just when it was starting to get good for me, he was gonna look up at me with these lobster eyes, like, "Can I come up now?"
So what makes you come?
I don't know.
The usual stuff.
Why are we talking about this?
Maybe you've never had an orgasm.
Of course I've had an orgasm.
Because if you had, you wouldn't be embarrassed about asking for more tongue time.
Could I have really never had an orgasm?
I've definitely felt a surge of desire.
And then you know a sort of relief of that desire.
Oh my God, Claire.
Have you never even rubbed one out?
- You don't masturbate?
- l don't find it that interesting!
You know, Claire, we could show you how to give yourself an orgasm right now if you want.
Um, hello, not lesbians.
I really don't think it's possible that I've never had an orgasm.
Well, if you haven't, you're seriously missing out.
I'd like to say George has told me a lot about you, but he really hasn't told me anything at all.
That's because he doesn't know anything about me.
I know you hate me, and you seem to blame me for everything you don't like about your life.
Why is he here?
Oh, this was your idea.
- Well--
- Of course it was her idea.
You made it perfectly clear you never wanted to see me again.
I didn't!
Thanks.
Kyle, look, we can't change the past.
But maybe we can start fresh, if you're willing--
You know what you can't do.
You can't walk in here and start saying this is this, and that is that, like you're God!
Because you know what?
You're not God.
You're not even close.
I want... all deliveries of excrement to our house to cease!
Yeah, well, I want there to be world peace, but I don't see that happening either.
Why the hell are you so angry at me?
It's your mother you should be angry at-- and your grandparents.
What is it, you find my shit offensive?
No.
I find it childish and hostile.
And I'm completely baffled at the timing.
I mean, why now?
Because my therapist says I need to express my true feelings to you.
This is a goddamn waste of time.
George, please.
Are you all right, Kyle?
- Do you need anything?
- Like what?
I don't know.
Clothing, underwear, socks?
No.
Would you like a cappuccino from my $7500 espresso machine, which I bought so I would never have to leave this motel room, because I'm so fucking twisted thanks to you-know-who?
Thank you, yes, I'd love a cappuccino.
I was kidding. I don't even know how to work it yet.
Well, we could all go to Starbucks.
I feel so "Sharon Stone."
Do people still do these things when they've had kids?
Yeah, some people do, and some people don't.
I once walked in on my parents.
My father was rubbing a rolling pin over my mother's breasts.
is that something you'd like for me to do for you?
Uh, no, thank you.
But I mean, that fucked me up more than if they'd just been fucking in front of us.
Which they also did, by the way.
I'm sorry.
- That was fun.
- No, it wasn't.
Kyle deliberately spilled his frappuccino all over me.
No, it was just that he was so nervous being out in the world.
Oh, my heart goes out to him.
He lives in a motel!
Only because he's too damn lazy to change his own sheets.
Ruth, his mother's family comes from major money, old, old money.
He doesn't need us.
Children need more from their parents than money!
It's unfortunate that I was cut out of his life, but the fact remains I was cut out of his life.
And that's not gonna change.
He seemed so lonely.
Maybe we should invite him to dinner.
Yeah, sure.
Why not?
Hey, how was the funeral?
It was...
"Awesome.
The old guy would have liked it."
Mmm, what's this?
That?
That's The Rock.
I would definitely tap that ass.
I'm still not out at work.
Yeah, so?
I thought you were kinda pushing me to come out.
I don't care about that anymore.
It's boring.
And I'd rather not fight.
Okay.
Did you have fun?
Huh, did you have fun?
She had a blast.
I can really see Lisa in her, Nate.
Yeah.
Listen, Barb, I need to tell you something.
I, uh... I went to a psychic.
Uh-huh.
Was that helpful?
She said Lisa's still alive.
Jesus Christ.
I don't believe this.
What's wrong with you, Nate?
Do you need help?
Because if you do, you should get it and not from a fucking psychic.
I want to have kids too.
Or just one or, uh, or several.
And I want to have them... it... with you.
I mean, I never really saw myself as, or-- l never really thought it was possible, but somehow ever since we've met... everything seems--
(camera shutter clicking)
Ohh.
Hey!
(child giggles)
What the... who's that?
(giggling)
You're dead.
Who grabbed me?
Watch out!
Who grabbed me?
Who grabbed me?
Girl:
I'm not done.
Woman:
Honey, you're gonna be late.
Man:
What'd you grab me for?
Boy:
How hard is that?
Girl:
Mom, i can't find my shoes for school.
They're under the couch.
(baby crying)
Sit down.
Yeah.
Dad, will you sign my permission slip for tomorrow?
Give it to your mother.
Your mother's arms are full.
(baby cries)
You got time for pancakes?
Father:
Nope.
Give us another one, dad.
(baby cries)
Secretary of defense.
Dean rusk.
Wrong.
And you get to wax my car.
Rusk is state, moron.
It's robert mcnamara.
Attorney general.
Too easy.
(telephone rings)
Children:
Yeah, it's bobby kennedy.
(ring)
All right, wise guys.
Assistant secretary of state for latin america.
Boy:
That's too hard.
Father:
Wait a minute.
This isn't a permission slip.
Baby:
Mama!
This is your report card.
Have you seen these grades?
No.
Father:
All right.
Gotta go.
Be good.
You... i'm talking to you later.
(telephone rings)
(ring)
(whistling)
Morning, evelyn.
Hi, ken.
Ooh, those candies are for the kids.
Is that right?
(whistling)
Morning, floyd.
Good morning, mr.
O'donnell.
(elevator bell dings)
(ding)
Morning, jackie.
Hi, kenny.
Want a schedule?
No.
Why'd you cross all my people off the list?
Because you don't have anybody on it who means anything.
No votes there.
There's no money.
It's a party, kenny.
And the one thing we both can be sure of is that you don't know how to have a party.
Well, party to you, politics to me.
So, who do you want?
For real?
Everyone on my list.
I don't want to spend an entire evening pretending that your votes and money are more interesting than they really are.
And i want my kids to stop eating the candy in the oval office.
That's not me.
Then who is it?
I don't rat on my friends.
Well, i'm going to take this whole list thing up with your friend.
Are you trying to go around me?
Go around you, over you, through you... whatever it takes.
You're starting to bug me.
(chuckles) Good.
I'll get back to you.
Top of the morning, mr.
President.
Morning, kenny.
Just ran into your wife.
Want to talk about this party?
No.
You see homer capehart's tirade today?
I did.
I don't see why he needs to invent an issue.
He's got his election sewn up.
Even so, we should still go out for bobby.
It's good groundwork for us in '64.
Look into that, uh... that vietnam thing.
What, the 2 planes that went down?
Yeah.
It didn't make it before press time.
I haven't taken a look at the west coast papers yet, but i doubt we'll see anything till tomorrow.
I was eating that.
No, you weren't.
I was.
No, you weren't.
I was.
I was, you bastard.
So, what do we got today?
Today.
That's it.
That's the one we're looking for.
I need to see the president, kenny.
All right.
2:30 to 2:45 or 4:30 to 5:00.
Take your pick.
No, i need to see him now, ken.
You can go on up.
I'll let him know you're coming.
Coffee?
Yeah.
O'donnell:
That's not what you said.
Man:
What'd i say?
Tell me what i said.
That's not what... listen to me, you worthless piece of shit.
Now, you will put daley's man on the circuit, and you'll do it today.
You owe your goddamn job to this administration.
Yeah, i can... i can hear how grateful you are, but there's a word you need to learn.
It's the only word in politics.
It's called loyalty.
Loyalty!
Now, any part of this you don't understand?
Good.
What?
This isn't the blessed order of st.
Mary the meek.
Look, you better come in here.
What was it you were saying to me the other day about cuba?
It wasn't important?
Not as far as the election goes.
Mac, let's, uh... can i see that for a second, please?
Ken, you used to look down a bombsight for a living.
Just ignore the labels.
What does that look like to you?
I don't know.
What is it?
On sunday morning, one of our u-2s took these pictures.
The soviets are putting medium-range ballistic missiles into cuba.
They appear to be the ss-4, range of 1000 miles, 3-megaton nuclear warheads.
Seen here in this year's mayday parade in red square.
Jesus christ in heaven.
Operator:
Yes, operator.
Second operator:
White house operator.
Yeah, mr.
O'donnell, please, for secretary mcnamara.
Go ahead, please.
Yeah.
White house operator.
I've got the president for the attorney general.
Go ahead, please.
What the crap is going on today?
O'donnell:
That's right.
That's right.
The principals are assembling in an hour.
We'll see you then.
Where's bobby?
O'donnell:
He should be here any minute.
Well, good.
Good.
Bobby:
Where the hell are you?
We're in here.
Jesus christ, guys.
What the hell is khrushchev thinking?
You have any indication of this from your kgb pal bolshakov?
Any possible warning, sense of motivation?
Complete snow job.
And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into cuba.
Jesus, I... i feel like we caught the jap carrier steaming for pearl harbor.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Ail:
Good morning, mr.
President.
Mr. Secretary.
Mr. President.
Bob, i'll bet you had a late night.
Sleep is for the weak, mr.
President.
Max.
Mr. President.
The cia's been notified.
Mccone's on his way back from the west coast.
He's been burying his stepson.
General carter is here, though.
Ted.
Kenny.
President:
Ok.
Let's have it.
Arthur?
Gentlemen, as most of you now know, a u-2 over cuba sunday morning took a series of disturbing photographs.
Our analysis at npic indicates that the soviet union has followed up its conventional weapons buildup in cuba with the introduction of surface-to-surface medium-range ballistic missiles, or mrbms.
Our official estimate at this time is that this missile system is the ss-4 sandal.
We do not believe that the missiles are as yet operational.
Iron bark reports that the ss-4 can deliver a 3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.
So far, we've identified 32 missiles serviced by about 3,400 men, undoubtedly all soviet personnel.
Our cities and military installations in the southeast as far north as washington, d.c., are in range of these weapons and in the event of a launch would have only 5 minutes of warning.
5 minutes, gentlemen.
In those 5 minutes, they could kill 80 million americans and destroy a significant percentage of our bomber bases, degrading our retaliatory options.
The joint chiefs' consensus, mr.
President, is that this signals a major doctrinal shift in soviet thinking to a first-strike policy.
It is a massively destabilizing move.
How long until they're operational?
Lundhal:
General taylor can answer that question better than i can.
Gmac... guided missiles intelligence committee... estimates 10 to 14 days.
A crash program could limit that time, however, i must stress that there may be more missiles that we don't know about.
We need more u-2 coverage.
President:
Gentlemen, i want first reactions here.
Assuming for the moment that khrushchev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start world war iii, what are we looking at?
Well, mr.
President, i believe my team is in agreement.
If we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences would be... too terrible to contemplate.
The russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want wherever they want, and we're powerless to stop them.
If they succeed... it'll be munich all over again.
Yes.
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive.
And the soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder.
Now, we must remove the missiles one way or another.
Now, it seems to me the options are either some combination of international pressure and action on our part till they give in, or... we hit them... an air strike.
Bob?
Mcnamara:
We worked up several military scenarios.
Before i ask general taylor to take us through the various options, i'd like for us to adopt a rule.
If we decide to strike, we must agree now to do it before the missiles become operational, because once they are, i don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least... at least some of them are launched.
Well, it's clear we cannot permit soviet nuclear missiles in cuba.
(sighs)
We have to get those missiles out.
You know, i don't think it's going to matter what khrushchev's intentions are.
I can tell you right now, i don't see any way around hitting them.
If we hit 'em, kill a lot of russians, they'll move against berlin.
All right, they attack berlin, that's nato, and we're at war.
Bobby:
We're damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in 6 months.
Well, if there are alternatives that make sense, and i'm not saying that there are, then we need them, and we need them fast.
All right.
What about congress?
Now, i think we may need to start letting key people know, and they're all scattered across the country for the campaign.
We can get congress back.
We're gonna need to get the u.n.
Stomping and warmed up.
What about the allies?
We can't start worrying about everything.
Right now we got to figure out what we're gonna do before we worry about how we're gonna do it.
We've got a bunch of smart guys.
We lock 'em in a room and kick 'em in the ass until they come up with some solutions.
I'll do it.
It's too politicized with you in there anyway.
They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Yeah.
It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department... the executive committee of the national security council.
Call it excomm.
President:
Ok.
So, i'm only gonna show for the meetings that you call me into.
And impress us.
Do it fast.
And, kenny, you're gonna be in charge of keeping this thing quiet.
I mean, if word gets out before we know what we're gonna do, there's gonna be panic.
And it's gonna ruin any chance we might have at surprise if we decide to hit them.
We're gonna need to do a few things right away.
No pierre.
He knows, the press knows.
And you're gonna have to keep up your schedule.
Your movements are followed too closely.
Well, george ball's got a conference room at state.
Good.
You meet over there this afternoon.
We'll figure out some way to sneak you guys back in here tonight.
I think we should bring in dean acheson.
Ken, he was fighting soviets while we were still playing ball together at school.
Find him, kenny.
We're gonna need all the help we can get.
(bobby chuckling)
Screw secrecy.
You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from foggy bottom.
You were excited.
I say no more.
Everybody agrees the diplomatic route won't work.
It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished while we're still talking.
Man:
I hear old warren harding used to get his girls in through here.
Officer:
We have 850 planes assembling at homestead, eglin, opalocka, macdill, patrick, pensacola, and key west.
Due to the tropical foliage, the op plan calls for high explosive and napalm load-outs for our ground-attack sorties.
I still think there are diplomatic approaches we haven't considered yet.
Jesus, adlai, peace at any price?
We have a gun to our head.
We have high confidence in the expanded air-strike option, mr.
President.
The problem is, sir, is that it's a short-term solution.
Khrushchev can send in more missiles next month.
The chiefs and i believe we should follow up the air strikes with a full version of op plan 316.
An invasion?
Yes, sir.
We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove castro so this can never happen again.
Is this the joint chiefs' recommendation?
Yes, sir.
Our best option, as bob pointed out this morning, would be to commence the strikes before the missiles become operational.
The invasion happens 8 days later.
Dean... what do you think?
Gentlemen, for the last 15 years, i've fought here at this table alongside your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet.
Now, i do not wish to seem melodramatic, but i do wish to impress upon you a lesson i learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice.
The soviet understands only one language... action.
Respects only one word... force.
I concur with general taylor.
I recommend, sir, air strikes followed by invasion, perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if that is militarily viable.
So, it appears we have 3 options.
Number one...
a surgical air strike against the missiles themselves.
2... a much larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles, and 3... invasion.
So, we're certainly gonna do number one.
We're gonna take these missiles out.
It seems to me we can't wait very long.
We should at least be making those preparations.
We're preparing to implement all 3 options, though i must stress again, sir, there are risks to the strikes without the follow-on invasion.
You want to be clear, mr.
President, that we've definitely decided against a political track.
Dean, uh... how does this all play out?
Your first step, sir, will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours.
They will refuse.
When they do, you will order the strikes, followed by the invasion.
They will resist and be overrun.
They will retaliate against another target somewhere else in the world, most likely berlin.
We will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there, defeating them per our plans.
Those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons.
(sniffs)
So what is the...
what is the next step?
Hopefully, cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step.
Thank you, gentlemen.
(sighs) what happened in there?
I thought he was gonna give us his decision.
Bundy:
Look, i know them.
They just need to make sure there's no other way.
They'll get there.
Acheson:
Remember that kennedy's father was one of the architects of munich.
There's only one responsible choice here, so let's hope appeasement doesn't run in families.
I fear weakness does.
Jesus christ.
(all laugh)
Call... call me irish, but i don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
You know, they think i froze in there.
Bobby:
You didn't freeze.
You did exactly what you should've done.
You stayed out of the corner.
You didn't decide.
Well, acheson's scenario is just... it's unacceptable, and he's got more experience than any of them.
There is no expert on the subject.
I mean, there is no wise old man.
There's... shit.
There's just us.
The thing is that acheson's right.
Talk alone is not gonna accomplish anything.
Well, let's bomb the shit out of 'em.
(chuckles)
Everybody wants to.
I mean, even you.
I mean, even me.
Right?
It sure would feel good.
Bobby:
And, jack, i'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Things are happening too fast.
I mean, this is starting to smell like the bay of pigs all over again.
Well, tonight, listening to taylor and acheson, i kept seeing lemnitzer and dulles telling me all i had to do was sign on the dotted line, and the invasion would succeed, and castro... (grunts) and castro would be gone.
Just... easy...
just like that.
(sighs)
You know, there's something... immoral about abandoning your own judgment.
We just can't let this get out of hand.
And we're gonna do whatever we have to do and make this come out right.
I'm gonna stay here tomorrow.
O'donnell:
No, you can't.
Remember, we talked about this, your schedule.
The best thing you can do tomorrow is go to connecticut.
He's right.
Yeah.
Jesus.
(crowd cheering)
(marching band playing)
Doesn't anybody in connecticut have to work today?
Woman:
I love you, jfk!
(crowd cheering)
Taylor:
The full spectrum of air strikes is the minimum response the joint chiefs will accept.
Bobby:
No, no, no!
Now, there is more than one option here, and if one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough.
Bobby, sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank god when it's so clear.
You're talking about a sneak attack.
How will that make us look?
A big country blasting a little one into the stone age.
Oh, we'll be everyone's favorite.
Acheson:
Come on, bobby, that's naive.
This is the real world.
You know that better than anybody.
Mccone:
And you weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing castro over at cia.
Bob... if we go ahead with these air strikes, you know what it'll come to in the end.
There has got to be something else.
Give it to me.
Now, i don't care how crazy, inadequate, or stupid it sounds.
Give it to me.
6 months ago, we gamed out a scenario.
It's slow.
It doesn't get rid of the missiles.
It's got a lot of drawbacks.
The scenario calls for a blockade of cuba.
(camera shutter clicking)
Taylor:
The situation is worse than we thought.
We now count 40 missiles.
40 missiles.
Longer range irbms.
They can hit every place in the country except seattle.
Mr. President, you give me the order right now, my planes will be ready to carry out the air strikes in 3 days time.
All you gotta do is say go.
My boys will get those red bastards.
General, how long until the army's ready?
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a prearranged exercise, sir.
We're looking at another week and a half.
But you can order the strikes now.
The plans call for an 8-day air campaign.
It'll light a fire under the army's ass to get in place.
General lemay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action?
Mr. President, i believe it is the only course of action.
America is in danger.
Those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent.
Now, without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war.
It's our duty, sir, our responsibility to the american people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation.
The big red dog is digging in our backyard, and we are justified in shooting him.
Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational.
The other options do not guarantee the end result that we can guarantee.
However, as more time goes by, the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes.
Lemay:
Mr. President, the motto i chose for sac is " peace is our profession."
Now, god forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange, but if launched, those missiles from cuba would kill a lot of americans.
The very presence of those missiles gives the soviets first-strike capability.
Those missiles make a nuclear exchange more likely, and that is why i'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them and destroying them immediately.
Hell, even mac agrees.
And, sir, given your own statements about cuba, i think a blockade or a bunch of political talk would be considered by a lot of our friends and neutrals as a pretty weak response.
I suspect that many of our own citizens might feel the same way.
You're in a pretty bad fix, mr.
President.
What did you say?
You're in a pretty bad fix.
Maybe you haven't noticed you're in it with me.
Now, general, what are the soviets gonna do when we attack?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing, because the only alternative open to them is one they can't choose.
You know, they're...
they're not just missiles we're gonna be destroying, general.
If we kill soviet soldiers, they're gonna respond.
I mean, how would we respond if they killed ours?
No, they're gonna do something, general.
I can promise you that.
Those goddamn kennedys are gonna destroy this country if we don't do something about this.
We're headed out to the backyard to take a look for that big red dog.
(chuckles)
Thanks, bob.
I was hoping lemay pushed you, because i was ready to knock that son of a bitch across the room.
We knew it was coming.
And i'll tell you one thing, kenny, those brass heads have one big advantage.
That is, if we do what they want us to do, there's none of us gonna be left alive to tell 'em they were wrong.
(door opens) Mr. President, we need to go over what you're going to say.
Gromyko should be on his way by now.
Now, there's still no sign that they know that we know about the missiles.
Well, we're gonna keep it that way.
Kenny?
I'll be right there.
I'm getting funny questions from the guys.
Yeah?
What sort of questions?
About some sort of military exercises?
You want me to do my job handling the press, i need to know what's going on.
Military exercises?
Yeah, military exercises.
Haven't heard anything about it.
Ask bundy.
I did.
He said to ask you.
Male reporter:
Mr. Gromyko, this way, please.
Mr. Dobrynin, what are your hopes for the meeting?
Female reporter:
Mr. Gromyko, can you give us a statement, please?
Robert.
Hugh, how are you?
Good.
Excuse me, joan.
So, tell me about this military exercise that's going on down in puerto rico.
What?
It's called "ortsac." Castro spelled backwards.
Ortsac?
I... i don't know what you're talking about.
Me, either.
Why?
Well, because maybe the president and gromyko are gonna talk about it.
If you're trying to drum something up, forget it.
This meeting's been on the books for months.
Far as i know, it's just a friendly talk on u.s. -soviet relations.
Reporter:
Sir!
Sir!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
All right, hold it, guys.
Hold it.
You'll get your pictures.
Does it?
Mm-hmm.
I'll be damned.
Kind of simple for the pentagon.
Man:
Please.
Reporter:
What is this meeting about, sir?
Woman:
Sir!
Kennedy:
Mr. Gromyko, thank you for coming.
Hold on, guys.
One minute.
Man:
Gentlemen, would you mind shaking hands?
So that there should be no misunderstanding the position of the united states, which has been made clear by the attorney general to ambassador dobrynin here, i shall read a sentence from my statement to the press dated september 13th.
"Should missiles or offensive weapons
"be placed in cuba,
"it would present the gravest threat to u.s. National security."
Mr. President, as premier khrushchev's own statement of september 13th assured you, our military assistance to cuba is of a defensive nature only.
So i do not misunderstand you, there are no offensive weapons in cuba?
Premier khrushchev's statement of september 13th remains the position of the soviet government.
To that, i have nothing to add.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Thanks so much.
Gromyko:
Thank you.
Man:
Gentlemen, if you'll come with me, please.
Gromyko:
A most constructive meeting.
(reporters asking questions)
What happened?
Lying bastard.
Lied right to my face.
We're split down the middle.
If i held a vote, i think air strike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
I want a consensus.
Either air strike or blockade, but something everyone's going to stand by, even if they don't like it.
I need it by saturday.
Make it happen.
What if i can't?
We go into this split, the russians will know it.
They'll know it and use it against us.
Have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend?
If you don't show for chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care.
Just cancel it.
Forget it!
I'm not calling and canceling on daley.
You call and cancel on daley.
You're scared to cancel on daley?
You're damn right i'm scared.
Well, i'm not.
Oh.
Watch this.
Welcome to chicago, mr.
President.
Mr. Mayor, i wouldn't miss this event for the world.
Reporter:
Mr. President, over here!
Mayor daley!
Let's go.
Tonight, you're going to experience some true midwest... kenny!
What's going on?
Now the guys are hounding me about some troop movements in florida?
What are you telling them?
The truth...
i don't know.
Am i out of the loop on something?
No.
Tell them you've looked into it, and all it is is an exercise.
Oh, and, pierre, tomorrow, the president may have a cold.
A what?
A cold.
Pierre:
Kenny, do i get any input around here?
Yeah.
How bad it is is up to you.
There are major rail disruptions in the south.
2 airborne divisions are on alert.
Sounds to me like that exercise is an invasion.
Well, you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi.
We're invading cuba.
Damn it, we are not invading cuba.
Are you crazy?
Nobody gives a rat's ass about cuba... not now, not ever.
If you print something like that, all you're going to do is inflame the situation.
Nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations.
Assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop.
That's the first time you've ever threatened me.
All right.
I won't print anything until i have another source, but i promise you, i'll get one.
Bobby.
We've got a consensus for a blockade, but it won't last past tomorrow, kenny.
You have to bring him back.
Oh, by the way, china invaded india today.
You're kidding, aren't you?
I wish i were.
Galbraith's handling it in new delhi.
Makes you wonder what's coming next.
Jesus, what is it about the free world that pisses the rest of the world off?
I don't know.
We have tupperware parties?
(laughs) Maybe.
I'll see you tomorrow.
O'donnell:
Ok.
The president has a cold.
He's canceling the remainder of this trip and returning to washington on the advice of his doctor.
(shouting questions)
President kennedy!
Is it true you have a cold, sir?
How do you feel, mr.
President?
Mr. President!
What's the next step going to be, mr.
President?
Mr. President!
Mr. President, our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba is our best option.
A strong showing of support from the organization of american states would give us an umbrella of legitimacy.
A blockade is technically an act of war.
Therefore, we recommend calling the action a quarantine.
Let's hope that translates into russian the way we want it to.
(chuckles)
There are between 20 and 30 soviet ships underway to cuba at this time.
800 miles out, the navy will stop them, board, and any vessels containing weapons will be turned back.
A quarantine prevents any more missiles from reaching cuba, but it doesn't remove the missiles already there.
It gives the soviets a chance to pull back without a war.
If they refuse to remove the missiles, we retain the option to strike and invade.
A sneak attack would be counter to what the united states stands for.
It leaves us no room to maneuver, and the inevitable soviet response would force us into a war.
Mr. President, there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes.
Sir, with a blockade, we lose strategic surprise.
We also run the risk of the soviets launching a first strike against us if they decide they have to use the missiles or lose them.
So, quarantine or air strike.
Stevenson:
Ahem.
There is a third option.
With either course, we undertake the risk of nuclear war.
It seems to me that maybe one of us in this room should be a coward, so i guess i'll be.
A third course is to strike a deal.
We trade guantanamo and our missiles in turkey, get them to pull their missiles out.
We employ a back channel.
We attribute the idea to outant.
Outant then raises it at the u.n.
I don't think that's possible, adlai.
I've not yet made my final decision.
I'll be asking the networks for airtime on monday night.
We'll announce our course of action then.
Ted, i want you to get working on speeches for both quarantine and air strike.
Well, thank you for all your advice, gentlemen.
I did hear adlai.
Jesus, you'd think nobody learned anything from world war ii.
Somebody had to say it.
I respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We have to pull him.
He's not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the u.n.
Zorin will eat him alive.
We've got bigger problems right now.
Ladies?
No, thank you.
(jazz music playing)
Honey, i'll be right back.
Oh.
Hi.
Adlai?
Ah.
I just can't seem to get away from you guys.
Escaping for a night on the town, eh?
As d.c.'s most popular playboy, the president felt my presence would be sorely missed, so in the interest of national security, here i am.
Yes, gotta keep up appearances.
Of course, i don't anymore.
I'm a political dead man.
Did you ever see anyone cut his own throat like i did today?
No, no.
It's all right.
And by the way, i spoke to a friend.
Reston and franco have the story.
The 't imes' is gonna run it tomorrow.
We're not gonna make it to monday.
Shit.
We can get sorenson to lean on reston, but you're gonna have to call orville dryfoos.
This is the sort of decision a publisher makes himself.
All right.
Thanks, kenny.
(sighs) Yes, sir, i understand, but, you know, we held on the bay of pigs, and it was the biggest mistake of my life.
What makes this different?
Orville, i'm asking you to hold the story until i can present our course of action on monday night.
All right, but i'm gonna need a reason to give my boys.
They're gonna be screaming for my head on a plate.
Listen, orville, you tell them this... that they'll be saving lives... including their own.
(sighs) Yes, mr.
President.
(singing in latin)
How many congressmen have not responded yet?
14.
Boggs is in the gulf fishing?
Man:
Yes, sir.
I thought he was supposed to be campaigning.
Man:
Well, he's not gone for long.
Jesus.
Get a plane out there and get him back.
He wants to talk to lemay again.
He's still considering air strikes.
None of this works tomorrow.
Figure out how to cancel it.
Yes, sir.
We're on the phones.
(sighs)
Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all the missiles?
Sir, i guarantee we'll get all the missiles we know about.
Mr. President, we can get better than 90% of them.
I'll brief the congressional leadership tomorrow evening at 5:00.
At 7:00, all united states armed forces worldwide will stand up to defcon 3.
I have a brief statement to make.
President kennedy will address the nation tonight on radio and television on a subject of the highest national urgency.
He has requested airtime on all 3 networks for 7 p.m.
Thank you very much.
(helicopter)
Congressman:
I am not willing to support anything but the toughest possible... second congressman:
Congress cannot give you the support you're looking for.
Mr. President!
Man:
Sir?
If they want this goddamn job, they can have it.
It's no great joy to me.
Mr. President, here's the speech.
I made those changes you wanted.
I need a minute.
Kenny, no.
A minute.
Look, i don't want a goddamn pep talk.
You're not the harvard quarterback anymore.
We're on the brink here!
They're trying to second- guess me into world war 3.
Well, it's not gonna happen.
What did you think congress was gonna do?
Well, I... offer you unconditional support?
Kiss your catholic ass?
They don't think we even deserve to be here.
Well, what the hell do you think?
I think we haven't been that impressive today.
They have good reason to question our judgment.
What do you want, kenny?
I want you to sit down.
Well, i'm not going to sit down!
I want you to sit down, loosen your tie, and take a minute... i haven't got a minute!
You're the president of the united states.
They can wait for you.
(sighs)
Well, why not?
(chuckles)
Things can't get much worse.
Oh, i don't know.
We could have to go down to lyndon's ranch again dressed up as cowboys.
(laughs)
Shoot deer out of the back of his convertible.
That was a bad day.
You know, i thought there'd be... more good days.
You know, back when we were in the wards, that day bobby made me come down and meet you?
I didn't get you at first.
I thought you were lucky.
Your father had a lot of money.
You were skinny.
Girls loved you.
I thought i could beat you and bobby up together.
But he just kept going on and on about you.
I thought it was because he was your brother.
But i was wrong.
I was wrong.
You sleeping?
No.
Not much.
But i slept last night, though, you know, and, jeez, i... when i woke up, i just... somehow i'd forgotten that all this had happened, you know?
Then, of course, i remembered, and... i just wished for a second somebody else was president.
You mean that?
I said, for a second.
Boy, there is a lot of noise out there, kenny.
You know what you're doing, mr.
President.
You're going to make the best call you can, and you know they're going to second-guess you.
So what?
We're just gonna have to take our beatings as we go.
So, what are we going to do now?
I'm going on tv.
You know, maybe the american people will go with me.
Even if their... elected representatives won't.
You wear something nice for the tv.
Make sure jackie picks it.
(low chatter)
Excuse me.
Oh, right.
Thanks, pierre.
Now, i just changed... pierre:
Ok, everybody, i think we're ready.
No, i'm fine.
Thank you.
Mr. President, in 5, 4, 3, 2... good evening, my fellow citizens.
This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the soviet military buildup on the island of cuba.
Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island.
The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere.
Acting therefore in the defense of our own security and under the authority entrusted to me by the constitution, i have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately.
First, to halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba is being initiated.
All ships of any kind, bound for cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons, be turned back.
Second, i have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of cuba and its military buildup, and should these military preparations continue, further action will be justified.
I have directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventualities.
And third, it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack by the soviet union on the united states requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the soviet union.
Good speech, teddy.
Yeah, well, i guess i get to keep my job.
No.
It was a really good speech.
I can't imagine what you did with the air strikes version.
I wasn't able to write it, kenny.
It's kind of hard to write the unthinkable.
I tried.
I just... i couldn't.
We're getting the soviet response.
It's coming in on the teletype.
Bobby: " the community of nations recognizes the fundamental right of freedom of the seas..."
o'donnell:
It's horseshit.
Bobby:
I agree.
They don't know how to respond yet.
So now you're khrushchev.
What do you do?
You run the blockade.
They'll run the blockade.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, mr.
President.
We're tracking 26 ships inbound for cuba.
They show no sign of changing course.
The closest ships, the 'gagarin' and the 'k imovsk', will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Bobby:
Admiral anderson, if the ships do not stop, exactly what are our rules of engagement?
Well, russian-speaking personnel have been transferred to all our ships.
When the quarantine takes place in the morning, our ships will attempt to make radio contact with the approaching vessels.
They'll be ordered to reduce speed and standby for inspection.
An inspection team will then board and search the vessel.
If weapons are found, the ship will be ordered out of the quarantine area, or if they refuse, they'll be towed into the nearest port.
What happens if the ship doesn't stop for inspection or want to be towed?
We fire a warning shot across their bow.
And what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot?
We then fire at its rudder, disable it, and carry on our inspection.
There will be no shooting without my explicit orders.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Well, admiral, looks like it's up to the navy.
The navy won't let you down, sir.
There's one other thing, mr.
President.
We're commencing low-level photography runs over cuba this morning.
It'll be more detailed than the u-2 photography.
This way, we'll be able to firm up our estimates of the missiles' readiness and develop target packages for strikes, if you should order them, sir.
To protect our pilots, we're prepared to retaliate against any sam site or antl-aircraft battery that may open fire.
We have a flight of thunderchiefs that'll be able to respond within minutes to any attacks on our planes.
(sighs)
I got a bad feeling about what's going on in there.
In the morning, i'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room, and mcnamara is going to set up shop at the pentagon and keep an eye on things there.
Good, because you'll get armed boarders climbing onto soviet ships, shots being fired across bows... well, what about these low-level flights?
We need the flights.
They're starting in what?
An hour.
You realize what you're letting yourself in for?
We need the flights, because the minute that first missile becomes operational, we gotta go in there and destroy it.
Fair enough, but castro's on alert, and we're flying attack planes over their sites on the deck!
There's no way for them to know we're carrying cameras, not bombs.
God damn it!
We're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
I'm your political advisor.
I'm giving you a political analysis here.
This... this is a set-up.
The chiefs want to go in.
They need to redeem themselves for the bay of pigs.
They gotta go in this time.
They got to do it right.
I'm going to protect those pilots.
They're boxing us in with these rules of engagement.
If you agree to them and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won't stop for inspection, the chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting.
They want a war, jack, and they're arranging things to get one.
How does a man get to a place where he can say,
"throw those lives away," so easily?
Maybe it's harder for them to say than they let on, but at the very least, they believe it's in our best interest.
And you know what?
At the end of the day, they may well end up being right.
Well, i'll tell you one thing, we're going to have to triple-check everything the chiefs say to us with the guys that actually have to do it.
And nobody's to know about this, because I...
but bobby.
I need redundant control over what happens out there.
And if things aren't as advertised, then you're going to make sure they come out the way i want them to come out.
That's gonna be... starting with this low-level flight thing.
That's gonna be tough.
You know how these guys are about their chains-of-command.
Listen, you tell them those chains-of-command end at one place...
me.
Go ahead, sir.
Yes?
Speak up, lady.
I cannot hear you.
I got a train to catch, and i'd like to be home by christmas.
Yeah?
That's the one.
Mr. O'donnell.
What's her name?
Margaret.
Margaret.
Margaret:
Give me a break.
I'm doing the best that i can.
Yes, sir.
I understand exactly what you're talking about.
I speak the language, too.
What?
Margaret, would you mind helping me with something?
What do you need, honey?
That tone of voice specifically.
What tone of voice?
What the hell is he talking about?
I told you, sir...
i'm sorry.
You're outta here.
(telephone rings)
(ring)
Man:
Ready room.
Hey, skipper, what are you doin'?
Lookin' out the door.
Man:
I'll get him for you.
For what?
Cuba.
Man:
Skipper!
Telephone.
Commander ecker.
Commander ecker?
This is the white house operator.
Please hold for... shit.
Honey, you don't know what shit is.
Commander?
My name's ken o'donnell, special assistant to the president.
Yes, sir.
The president's instructed me to pass along an order to you.
You are not to get shot down.
Uh... we'll do our best, sir.
I don't think you understand me, commander.
You're not to get shot down under any circumstances.
Whatever happens up there, you were not shot at.
Mechanical failures are fine.
Crashing into mountains, fine... but you and your men are not to be shot at, fired at, or launched upon.
Excuse me, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
Commander, if you are fired upon, the president will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you.
He doesn't want to have to do that.
It's very important that he doesn't, or things could go very badly out of control.
What about my men?
If we don't have anybody to protect us, i'm gonna be writing letters home to parents.
If the president protects you, commander, he may have to do it with the bomb.
Now, i've know the man for 15 years.
The problem is...
he will protect you.
So i'm asking, don't make him protect you.
Don't get shot at.
Ok, mr.
O'donnell, we'll do what we can.
I know you will.
Good luck, you guys.
Man:
Find your way back!
Stay close.
Hey, joey.
See ya, joey.
Thanks, joey.
Ready to go, jeremy?
Hey, bruce.
Skipper?
Never mind.
Just do what i do.
Hand signs only?
Gotcha.
You are clear and ready to go, sir!
Good luck, skipper!
(camera shutter clicking)
(speaking russian)
(yelling)
Oh-ho, man!
Shit!
Did you see it?
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Man, you were lucky, skipper.
Damn sparrows.
Must've been migrating.
Sparrows?
Probably hit a couple hundred of 'em.
How many did you hit, bruce?
Sparrows?
A few, i guess.
These, uh, 20 millimeter or 40 millimeter sparrows, sir?
Those are bird strikes.
Sparrows, to be precise.
It's the way it is, guys.
Man:
Get that film packed up.
Commander ecker.
Hello.
Sir.
Commander.
Mr. O'donnell, i've been ordered to deliver the film to the pentagon personally.
What's going on here?
The chiefs must want to talk to you.
They're gonna want to know if you were fired on.
Were you?
You could say that, sir.
Commander, listen to me.
Now, i know this must fly in the face of everything you've come to serve, but i'm asking you to look through this to the other side.
Commander william b.
Ecker reporting as ordered.
Commander.
Sir.
Put your gear down over here.
Would you like a glass of water or anything?
No, thank you, sir.
Sir.
Commander.
Sir.
Have a seat.
Now, commander, i assume you know why you're here.
Son, i want to know just one thing.
Those bastards shoot so much as a bb gun at you?
It was a cakewalk, sir.
Mr. President, the o.a.s. Meeting starts in less than an hour.
Well, good.
I think we need this one, dean.
We can't expect miracles.
Listen, the quarantine is legal if we get a mandate.
Otherwise, it's an act of war in the eyes of the world, so you gotta get me the vote, and, you know, make it unanimous.
Mr. President, the organization of american states hasn't had a unanimous vote... unanimous... dean.
(door closes)
(man speaking spanish)
In accordance with this afternoon's vote at the organization of american states, the quarantine will hereby be effective as of 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Man on tv:
At 8 a.m. This morning, the united states detonated a hydrogen bomb above johnston island in the south pacific.
The blast was quickly condemned by the soviet union, who called upon all nations to denounce the united states for bringing the world to the brink of destruction.
President:
Who the hell authorized this test?
Christ, what is this gonna say to the russians?
They look warlike?
Jesus christ.
We're lighting off nuclear weapons like it's our own private fourth of july.
President:
You know what we should have done?
We should've brought in the guys from the atomic energy commission and talked this through, you know?
Looked at these tests a little harder before just givin' the go-ahead.
You know, last summer i read a book, the guns of august.
Hmm.
I wish every man on that blockade line had read that book.
It's world war i, 13 million killed.
It was all because the militaries of both alliances believed they were so highly attuned to one another's movements and dispositions, they could predict one another's intentions, but all their theories were based on the last war,
and the world and technology had changed, and those lessons were no longer valid, but it was all they knew, so the orders went out.
Couldn't be rescinded.
The man in the field, his family at home, they couldn't even tell you the reasons why their lives were being destroyed.
But why couldn't they stop it?
What could they have done?
Here we are 50 years later.
If one of their ships resists the inspection and we shoot out its rudder and board, they shoot down one of our planes in response, so we bomb their antiaircraft sites.
In response to that... they attack berlin.
So we invade cuba.
Then they fire their missiles.
And we fire ours.
Helen, i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow.
I want you to leave the tv on.
I want you to sleep with it on in the bedroom until i call you and tell you you can turn it off.
What's happened?
Nothing.
Nothing you don't already know about.
Just have the car ready to go in case i call... or the civil defense warning comes on.
What happens to you?
I'm not leaving without you.
I'll be evacuated with the president.
(gasps)
Great.
Great.
And while you're under a rock somewhere with the president, what am i supposed to do with our 5 children?
Honey, we're not gonna let it come to that.
I promise.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Jack and bobby, they're... they're smart guys.
You're smart, too.
Not like them.
Well, hi, ken.
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
Yeah, i just checked that myself.
They're being issued identity cards, and the call comes, evacuation officers meet them at prearranged departure areas.
They go by helicopter to mount weather.
We meet them there.
Of course, that's for morale.
Missiles only take 5 minutes to get here.
The president has asked jackie and the children to come back from the country and be with him.
You know those pictures upstairs?
Pictures of lincoln?
He looked so old near the end.
When we got here, i said,
"it's not gonna happen to us."
We were too young.
Why don't you go home tonight?
Hmm?
Go on home.
No.
It's too much trouble to get the car.
Ken, we can get your car in 15 minutes.
No.
Go ahead.
No.
I'll let her sleep.
I'll let 'em sleep.
It almost seemed today as if time stood still.
The shooting hadn't started yet, but there weren't any really encouraging signs that it could be avoided, but worried, alarmed, afraid, perhaps even, the american public, nonetheless, appeared determined and resolved.
This is walter cronkite.
(bell ringing) Good night.
(ding)
Paper?
Yeah, thanks.
Here you go, sir.
Gentlemen, can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yes, we can hear you fine.
I've got one minute till 10:00 here.
The quarantine commences in one minute.
And no sign of them stopping.
Sir.
Quarantine is now in effect.
And it looks like our first customers are the 'gagarin' and 'k imovsk'.
Chief, i've got something at zero-three-zero.
X.o., take a look at this.
New contact, skipper.
We do we got?
A russian sub.
General quarters, general quarters!
All hands man your battle stations!
General quarters, general quarters!
All hands man your battle stations!
General quarters, general quarters!
All hands man your battle stations!
Bracket 231 correlates submarine at 9,000 yards.
It's protecting the freighters.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping the submarine first?
I'm afraid not, mr.
President.
The sub has positioned itself between the 'p ierce' and the soviet ships.
Admiral anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters.
The 'p ierce' would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Put me through to the 'p ierce'.
Yes, sir.
Admiral anderson!
The president wishes to speak directly to the captain of the 'p ierce'.
Is that a problem?
No, it isn't, sir.
He's putting you through, sir.
Sir, i'm patching you through to the bridge now.
This is the captain of the 'p ierce'.
Captain, this is the president speaking.
Mr. President.
Is there any way you can force that sub to the surface without damaging it or yourself?
I can bring it up, mr.
President, but whether it's damaged or not is up to the sub.
Even if they do force it up, that sub will be inspected over the crew's dead bodies.
They'd be executed for allowing it when they got home.
Captain, force the sub to the surface.
Yes, mr.
President.
Prepare to fire torpedoes.
Prepare to fire torpedoes.
Aye, sir.
Prepare to launch az rocket.
Prepare to launch az rocket, aye, sir.
Watch your fingers!
Watch your fingers.
What are they up to?
They're slowing down.
(tapping)
(beeping)
Mr. Secretary, i'm receiving reports.
The russian ships appear to be stopping.
Mr. President, reports are coming in here to the pentagon that the ships appear to be stopping.
Captain, belay that order.
Belay that order!
Hold your fire!
Bob, where's that coming from?
One second, mr.
President.
Somebody find out what's going on.
Those ships are definitely stopping.
Some are turning around.
Are they stopping?
I don't know what the hell they're doing.
Admiral.
Admiral, what's happening!
Yes, sir, they are stopping.
(cheering) Mr. President, reports are coming in from all around.
The ships are stopping.
Some are turning around.
Some are turning around.
We were eyeball to eyeball, and i think the other fella just blinked.
(laughing)
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
We have that information.
Mr. President.
Mr. President, sir.
We have the tally from nsa.
We have 20 ships stopping and/or turning around.
6, however, appear to be continuing for the line.
It's a, uh, it's a mistake.
They must not have gotten their orders yet.
I'd...
let 'em go.
No.
That's unlikely, bobby.
We've been monitoring the radio transmissions from the 'gagarin' and the 'k imovsk'.
Their radios are working just fine, mr.
President.
One ship, an accident maybe.
6, mr.
President?
This is intentional.
Bob:
Mr. President, let 'em go.
Oh, you're still here, bob?
4 of the 6 continuing ships are still a day away from the line.
They've stopped the ones we suspect have weapons aboard.
We'd look pretty bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food.
We sure as shit would.
Captain, i want you to maintain contact with those ships and do nothing until i order otherwise.
Is that clear?
Yes, mr.
President.
Contact only.
At its beginning, this day looked as though it might be one of armed conflict between soviet vessels and american warships on the sea lanes leading to cuba.
Find out how close our exercises are coming to their antl-ship missiles.
President:
God damn it!
How the goddamn hell did this happen?
I'm gonna have powers' head on a platter... next to lemay's.
Kenny, you hear me give the order to go to defcon 2?
Because i remember giving the order to go to defcon 3, but i must be suffering from amnesia.
I've just been informed our nuclear forces are at defcon 2.
They were limited, mr.
President.
The orders were limited to our strategic forces... max!
...continental united states.
General lemay is correct.
Technically, sac has the statutory authority... i have the authority!
I am the commander in chief of the united states, and i say when we go to war.
We're not at war, sir...
not until defcon one.
General, the joint chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the soviets.
You signaled an escalation which i had no wish to signal, and which i did not approve.
Just get out of here, max.
Yes, sir.
Rescind the order.
Can all the chiefs.
Put kilpatrick and the under secretaries in charge.
Can't do that, bobby.
Yes, we can.
We can't fire the chiefs, bobby.
Our invasion talk would look like a bluff.
Or even worse, that there's been an attempted coup.
Jesus.
(sighs)
Kenny, give me a couple minutes alone with bobby, would you?
Just... just try this on for size.
We get ahold of walter lippmann, and we leak the idea of pulling our jupiter missiles out of turkey, and the soviets pull their missiles out of cuba.
Act through the u.n.!
K and k must talk!
End the arms race, not the human race!
(chanting)
Kenny.
Mac.
What did you think of the lippmann column this morning?
I think it's a bad idea.
Thank god.
Look, everybody's furious about it.
We trade away our missiles in turkey, and we're dead, politically.
You've got to stop it.
We know it was jack and bobby's idea.
They leaked it to lippmann.
The military guys are going ape... then they should speak up.
Christ, ken, it's not that easy.
It is.
No, it isn't.
They don't trust the people who feel this way, but these people are right, and the kennedys are wrong.
We need you to talk to them.
They'll listen to you.
Jack and bobby are good men, but it takes a certain... you mean the president of the united states?
And the attorney general?
Kenny, they are good men, but it takes a certain character, moral toughness, to stand up to the soviets.
You listen to me.
You're in the white house right now because of the kennedys.
Now, they may be wrong, they make mistakes, but they are not weak.
The weak ones are these people who can't seem to speak their own minds.
You know i don't mean that they're weak.
No, they just lack a moral toughness.
Jesus christ, mac.
You... you think i'll play your judas for you?
You've never understood us, your kind.
We've been fighting with each other our whole lives, but nobody plays us off each other, and nobody ever, ever gets between us!
It's a goddamn trial balloon, kenny.
Well, then somebody better publicly deny it, 'cause there's only one way the world's gonna read this.
We sell out one of our friends for our own safety.
Faah!
Exactly.
(man speaking russian on tv)
Jesus christ, they're just killing us.

Translator:
...diplomatic resolution.
(speaking spanish)
Translator:
The u.s. Believes that with their economic boycott, by pressuring other countries to cease trade with cuba, we would surrender due to hunger.
How does it feel, mr.
President, to be this heroic and force a country to surrender... am i still on hold here?
They're trying to find him right now.
Ken, adlai's too weak.
We have to convince jack to pull him.
Get mccloy in there.
You can't take him out this late in the game, bobby.
Zorin will eat him alive.
Then talk to your brother, god damn it.
The two of you don't need my advice to get into trouble.
What's gotten into you?

Naval blockade... are you still sore about this lippmann thing?
That's something your father would have done right there.
My father?

The president told me to pass a word to you.
Stick it to them.
Translator:
Cuba together... i hear you.
I'm glad it's you calling.
L... i thought it would be bobby.
Adlai, the world has to know we're right.
If we're gonna have a chance at a political solution, we need international pressure.
You got to be tough, adlai.
You need to find it, buddy.
Well, if they're still sticking to their stonewalling strategy, i'll get them.
I'm an old political cat, kenny... but i've got one life left.
I know you do.
See you, ken.

We'll be able to find together a proper... bobby.

Thank you, mr.
Chairman.
(speaking russian)
Translator:
We're very glad that you could join us, mr.
Stevenson.
For the last 2 hours, the entire world here is asking only questions.
The united states is pushing the entire world to the brink of catastrophe.
The people of the whole world want to know why.
We are told again and again about some incontrovertible evidence of offensive weapons in cuba... but no evidence can be shown to us.
Perhaps your spy planes are so secret that you are simply incapable to present such evidence.
Some planes.
Bobby:
I make the call, adlai is out.
Mccloy goes in.
Let's just hope it doesn't come to that.
...simply don't have such evidence.
(speaking russian)
Huh?
Translator:
Perhaps the united states of america is simply mistaken.
Huh?
Yes, the united states of america does not have any facts in hands, only falsifications.
John, get ready to send your staffer in.
He's gonna be coming out.

The chair recognizes the representative from the united states of america.
Well, let me say something to you, mr.
Ambassador.
We do have the evidence.
We do have it, and it is clear and incontrovertible.
And let me say something else.
Those weapons must be taken out of cuba.
You, the soviet union, have created this new danger... come on, adlai.
Not the united states.
Mr. Zorin, i remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons, but today, again, if i have heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist.
All right, sir, let me ask you one simple question.
Come on, adlai, don't let him off.
Do you, ambassador zorin, deny that the ussr has placed and is placing medium and intermediate-range missiles in sites in cuba?
Yes or no?
Don't wait for the translation.
Yes or no?
Yeah.

I am not in the american courtroom, and i do not wish to respond to questions... questions that a prosecutor would put to the defendant.

If you have decided not to continue your statement, the chair recognizes the representative from chile.
I yield my time on the floor to the representative of the united states.
Well, then, ladies and gentlemen, since it appears we're going to be here for a while, shall we have a look at what the soviets are doing in cuba?
May we have the presentation, please?
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will observe in photograph "a"... yeah.
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.
Adlai:
Taken approximately august 29... old adlai had it in him after all.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions.
Somebody in their foreign ministry is blowing it big time.
Adlai:
We have october 14th.
The photograph taken then... mr.
President.
Adlai:
There are at least 3 missile sites being constructed.
There are bunkers... the ship is called the 'grozny'.
We lost track of it yesterday at nightfall.
We thought we gave it plenty of room when we moved the quarantine line back.
We just reacquired it.
It crossed the line hours ago.
Well, how the hell do you lose a goddamn tanker?
What the hell's going on over?
Hail 'em again.
I want you to try 'em again.
(sighs)
We are kidding ourselves.
New coordinates for the 'p ierce'.
'P ierce' coordinates... 25 degrees, 30 minutes north,
78 degrees, 10 minutes west.
(man speaking russian) ...'p ierce' american... (repeats in russian)
Not responding, chief.
Tell the skipper.
They're not responding, sir.
P. A:
General quarters, general quarters!
All hands, man your battle stations.
All hands, man your battle stations.
(alarm sounding)
Very well.
Load your guns.
Guns are loaded, sir.
What was that, admiral?
We've been hailing the 'grozny' for the last hour, mr.
Secretary.
The 'grozny' refuses to stop.
What are you doing?
Carrying out our mission, mr.
Secretary.
Now, if you don't mind, we're very busy right now.
We need to be able to do our jobs.
Admiral, i asked you a question.
We're going to follow the rules of engagement... the rules of engagement which the president has approved and signed in his order of 23 october.
Yes.
Yes, you may proceed, captain.
Clear your guns.
What?
Damn it!
Stop that firing!
What?
Stop that firing!
Cease fire.
Cease fire!
God help us.
The ship was firing star shells.
What?
Star shells!
Flares, mr.
Secretary.
God damn it!
I've got a job to do here.
Now, you've been camped out out there since monday night.
You're tired, you're exhausted, and you're making mistakes.
You interfere with me and you will get some of my men killed, and i will not allow that!
Star shells.
Get out of our way, mr.
Secretary.
The navy's been running blockades since the days of john paul jones.
I believe the president made it clear that there will be no firing on ships without his express permission.
With all due respect, mr.
Secretary, we were not firing on that ship.
What the hell was that?
Firing on a ship means attacking a ship.
We were not attacking that ship.
We were firing over it.
That was not the president's intention when he gave that order.
What if the soviets don't see the distinction?
What if they make the same mistake i just made?
There will be no firing anything near any soviet ships without my express permission.
Now is that understood, admiral?
Is it?
!
Yes, sir.
And i will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the president.
John paul jones!
You don't understand a thing, do you, admiral?
This isn't a blockade!
This is language...
a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen.
This is president kennedy communicating with secretary khrushchev.
President:
Well, who the hell authorized this missile test?
Bobby:
Who do you think?
God knows what this is gonna communicate to the soviets.
Communicate with the soviets?
We can't communicate with the pentagon, and it's just across the goddamn river.
Lemay must think you're afraid of him.
I'm not taking that bait.
The bright move here is to move on.
(speaking russian over p.a.)
P. A:
The united states destroyer joseph p.
Kennedy... (speaking russian over p.a.)
Walter cronkite:
This is the point at which we are concerned that there might be shooting among the ships at sea, the possibility that invasion might have to be undertaken to assure that those bases are eliminated.
If invasion is undertaken, the russians have said that they would retaliate with rocket fire.
We have said if there's rocket fire from cuba, we will retaliate, and there goes the whole ballgame.
Kenny.
What's this?
Can anyone just walk in here now?
Ken, don't worry.
I'm not here to do an interview.
Well, if you're looking for a cup of sugar, john, you got the wrong door.
Kenny, we need to see the president.
Something's happened.
Tv:
The point of the crisis... this is the point at which... i have lunch with him, maybe once a month.
The way he talks, he acts like he knows khrushchev personally, but he's never elaborated.
President:
Mm-hmm.
I've used him as a source in a couple of stories.
The fbi has identified this alexander fomin as the soviet resident, um, the kgb equivalent of one of our station chiefs.
He's their highest-ranking spy in this country, and he knows john's a friend of mine.
All the trademarks of a back-channel overture.
Yeah.
Some back channel.
Abc news guy, my goddamn next-door neighbor.
Mm-hmm.
So they'll remove the missiles, and we'll pledge not to invade cuba or destabilize castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so.
I think this may be our first real message from khrushchev.
The alternative, mr.
President, is that this could be a trap.
President:
Mm-hmm.
And how is that exactly?
Dangle a settlement.
Tie us down in negotiation.
We come up short.
Why else would they approach us this way?
It's deniable.
The soviets have done nothing but lie to us.
This could just be more of the same.
That may be why khrushchev's introducing this guy.
We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
That may be what they want us to think.
The truth is, mr.
President, we don't even really know who fomin speaks for.
It could be khrushchev.
It could be some faction of the politburo or the kgb itself.
We just don't know.
Oh, by the way, scali, your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the national security act.
Kenny:
Sorry, john.
No pulitzer.
Mr. President, we haven't much time.
I'm scheduled to meet with him again in 31/2 hours.
So it seems the question of the day is, is the offer legitimate?
And if it is...
well, if it is, we can't afford to ignore it.
So, john... we'll have instructions for you in a couple of hours.
Thank you.
Thank you, john.
Sir, we don't have much time to play out back-channel communiques.
(sighs)
Kenny.
I need you to get over to your old stomping grounds and go through everything the fbi has on fomin, and i need your best call...
is the guy legit, and is he speaking for khrushchev?
Ok, so what we got here is this guy alexander feklisov, aka alexander fomin, declared council to the soviet embassy, but in reality the kgb papa spy.
An illustrious tour of duty during the great patriotic war gets him on the party fast track.
Various tours of duty in kgb.
American postings.
He's an expert on us, and that is all that we got on papa spy.
How do you become the kgb top spy in the united states?
You gotta know someone.
You gotta know someone.
So, politics is politics.
Walter, get me khrushchev's files.
Pass me that.
I want to see their career chronology side by side.
We know they're not related, right?
Right.
They're not from the same hometown.
They went to different schools.
Right.
So if they were gonna meet,
(taps paper) They should have met here.
I think they could have met.
They couldn't have.
He was an engineer stationed outside of moscow at the end of '41.
That's it.
They know each other.
They're war buddies.
That's pretty thin, kenny.
Well, real life usually is, walter.
They know each other, jack.
Khrushchev and fomin were war buddies.
You sure?
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence.
Well, you're there.
I mean, what's your instinct?
I gotta move on this.
My gut's telling me that khrushchev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Ok.
We're going.
I've been instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines that you have discussed.
If such a solution were raised at the u.n.
By ambassador zorin, he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson.
So, i understand you correctly.
If the missiles in cuba were dismantled, returned to the soviet union and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade cuba?
That is correct.
And this is from the highest authority?
Yes, the highest authority.
There are 2 conditions.
The u.n. Must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Of course, the u.n. Must also be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast.
I can't speak to that.
What's the second condition, john?
Time is of the essence.
How much time?
48 hours.
In 48 hours, there can be no deals.
Hoo hoo.
I'll see what i can do.
(teletype typing)
I think it's very difficult to make a decision from this document.
Well, it looks to me like fomin's overture was genuine.
President:
That's a big "if," bobby.
It's 10 pages of sentimental fluff, but he's saying it right here.
He'll remove the missiles in return for a no-invasion pledge.
Mm-hmm.
Mr. President, our early analysis says this probably was written by khrushchev himself.
It's a first draft.
It shows no signs of being polished by the foreign ministry.
In fact, it probably wasn't even approved by the politburo as they wouldn't let the emotionalism go by.
The analysts say it was written by someone under considerable stress.
(chuckling)
Glad to know we're not alone.
(laughter)
Well, it never was my intention to invade cuba anyway... until they put the missiles in there.
Gentlemen, i think we should seriously consider this deal.
(murmuring)
Hi.
Hi.
You look old, o'donnell.
(chuckles)
You don't.
It's 2:30 in the morning.
You flirting with me?
We got a back-channel communication from khrushchev this evening, feeling us out about a deal.
He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter.
Thank god.
Jack kicked us out of his house for the night.
Darn it.
For a second there, i thought you'd been fired.
No such luck.
You know, i'm driving home... there was something i wanted to tell you.
(telephone rings)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
Finish that thought.
(ring ring)
Yes?
Bobby:
Kenny, it's bob.
We're getting another letter over the teletype from khrushchev.
I have a bad feeling.
Ok, i'll be right there.
You're beautiful.
(baby crying)
It looks like fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
It gets worse.
Mccone:
Gentlemen, my specialists are in agreement.
This morning's letter is not khrushchev.
Last night's letter was.
The evidence supports only one conclusion.
There's been a coup, and khrushchev was replaced overnight.
Dean?
At the very least, it does suggest he's been co-opted by hard-line elements.
Which at the end of the day, amounts to the same thing.
A puppet khrushchev and a hard-line soviet government pulling the strings.
No deal, and the missiles are almost operational.
What if the soviets have no intention of honoring this second deal?
Then tomorrow, they make another condition.
Meanwhile, the quarantine isn't working, and they're completing work on the missile sites.
Sir, i think we have to issue pre-invasion orders for our forces.
Lundhal:
Mr. President, this morning's photography is in.
It appears the soviets have commenced a crash program to ready their missiles.
The first missiles became operational last night.
We expect they'll all be operational in 36 hours.
Mcnamara:
Then we're out of time.
We have to go in.
That may not be as easy as we thought, either.
We have gotten confirmation the soviets have also deployed battlefield nuclear weapons to cuba.
Lemay:
Frogs, we call 'em.
Short-range tactical nukes.
Now, we don't know whether they've delegated release authority to their local commanders for use on our invasion troops, but the good news is, as of this moment, we know where the frogs are,
and we can target them, too.
But the longer we wait, the harder it's going to get.
We have no choice.
General, issue orders to our forces to be prepared to execute the air strikes monday morning.
The follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter.
I'll need the official release orders on my desk on sunday night.
Understood, sir.
We'll need to step up our overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to carry out the strikes.
Permission granted.
Yes, sir.
Well, gentlemen, if anybody's got any great ideas, now's the time.
Major anderson, there's a phone call for you.
Thank you.
All right.
Give me just a second here, guys.
This is major anderson.
Hello?
Hello, anyone there?
Major?
Yes, sir?
My name is kenneth o'donnell, special assistant to the president.
(snaps fingers)
Major, a few days ago, the president ordered me to help him keep control of what's going on out there.
I've been... i've been browbeating pilots, you know, navy guys left and right to make sure you don't get us here in washington into trouble.
But you know what?
We're pretty damn good ourselves at getting into trouble, so instead of riding your ass, i'm just gonna tell you what's going on here and let you figure out how best to help us out up here.
Go ahead, sir.
Last night, it, uh... looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess.
Today, the soviets are reneging.
We're gonna try and salvage the situation, but a lot of things are going wrong today.
It's making everyone nervous.
And when things go wrong, people will become more nervous, and it will be very hard to avoid going to war.
Anderson:
Um... i'm not sure what you're trying to tell me, sir.
Just my standard line i've been repeating to guys like you all week.
Don't get shot down.
Beyond that, whatever else you can do to help us i'd appreciate it.
Sir... when you're at 72,000 feet, there's a million things that can go wrong.
I mean, is your oxygen mix right?
Are your cameras gonna freeze up?
Are you leaving a contrail?
Those million things, they're beyond your control mostly.
But... you know, when you realize that, there's a kind of peace, you know?
If you're a good man and if your ground crew are good men, that is all you can ask for.
With the grace of god, that'll get you through.
Are you a religious man?
Yes, sir, i am.
Good.
(machinery whirring)
(camera shutter clicking)
(alarm beeping)
(gasps)
(engines rewing)
(alarm beeping)
(beeping)
Aah!
(door opens)
The plane is missing, kenny.
We are presuming the pilot is dead.
Well, it's hard to believe, with the soviet centralized command structure, that this could've been an accidental launch.
The question is, does this attack on our plane represent a definitive intentional escalation on the part of the soviets?
Mccone:
Mr. President, taken with the events of the past few hours, i believe this confirms our worst fears.
We're now dealing with a hard-line soviet government, perhaps with khrushchev as a puppet head, perhaps not.
We don't know.
You ok?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Mr. President... president:
What now?
A u-2 on a routine air-sampling mission got lost and penetrated soviet airspace over siberia.
Oh, god damn it!
Soviets scrambled migs in pursuit thinking it was a bomber.
Got out ok.
Somebody forgot to cancel the mission.
President:
You know, there's always some son of a bitch who doesn't get the word.
You know, this is just what we need.
Soviets thinking we're bombing them.
Anybody else?
Taylor:
Mr. President, our pilots are in danger.
We must order punitive air strikes against the sam site that shot down major anderson per our rules of engagement.
(president sighs)
No.
I want confirmation it wasn't some sort of accident first.
Mr. President.
Lemay:
I think that's a good idea, mr.
President.
I can wait a day and a half.
Be safer for my boys to get the sams on monday when we get the rest of the bastards.
Quarterback:
Hut... hut!
Man:
Yeah, yeah.
(whistle blows)
Ail:
Break!
(whistle blows)
(whistle blows)
That's the quarter.
Hey, dad.
O'donnell:
Hey, sport.
You winning?
(panting) Yeah.
Is everything gonna be ok, dad?
Everything's gonna be fine, kenny.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
I, uh... I... (whistle blows)
Referee:
Let's go!
Second quarter!
It's ok.
Go on back to your game.
All right.
I'll see you around, dad.
Referee:
First down!
Team:
Break!
Damn it!
Jesus, mary, and joseph!
Take off for 2 hours, you're gonna miss a little drama.
I told you how stupid it was to float that lippmann article.
Now you're gonna do it for real?
The jupiters are obsolete, kenny.
They were supposed to have been dismantled... i know they're obsolete!
That's not the point.
The point is, you trade our missiles in turkey for theirs in cuba, they're gonna force us into trade after trade, until finally, a couple of months from now, they demand something we won't trade,
like berlin, and we do end up in a war.
Not to mention that long before that happens, this administration will be politically dead.
I don't care if this administration ends up in the freaking toilet!
We don't do a deal tonight, there won't be any administration.
It's the wrong move, bobby, and it's not just me who thinks that.
Everyone on this so-called excomm is telling you exactly the same thing.
Well, whose side are you on now, ken?
Oh... god damn it.
What if there hasn't been a coup at all?
What if it's you two?
What is that supposed to mean?
What if it was you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
Mr. President, we have only 30 hours left, and whatever response we send, it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the kremlin.
So we're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before khrushchev can respond.
Which one of you geniuses is gonna tell me how to explain it to the world if we don't make this trade?
So, what are we gonna say to the soviets about this offer?
Well, it depends, doesn't it?
I mean, do we really believe there's been a coup?
What if fomin wasn't a ploy?
What if his message was real?
What if what is happening is a series of accidents?
Accidents like them shooting down our u-2?
Yes, accidents like that.
And the accident's making the second letter seem more aggressive and the whole situation appear worse than it really is.
The guns of august.
Kenny:
That's right.
So we just reject the second letter?
No.
No, no.
We don't reject it.
We accept the first letter and pretend the second letter doesn't exist.
It won't work because that's wishful thinking!
He made an offer, so I... that's the same wishful thinking, bobby, that blinded us all these months while the soviets were sneaking those missiles in under our noses.
Mcnamara:
Ignore the second letter, agree to the conditions of the first.
Taylor:
There's no reason to believe the soviets will let it go.
Max is right.
Why will they accept it?
It can work if... if they believe we're gonna hit 'em, and hit 'em hard.
We've got time for one more round of diplomacy, and that's it.
The first air strikes start in 28 hours.
But we have to make them agree to it.
Right.
So how do we do that?
Well, we give them something.
We tell 'em we're gonna remove the missiles from turkey... (grumbling) Hang on!
But we do that 6 months from now, so it appears there's no linkage.
We also tell 'em if they go public about it, we'll deny it.
Right.
We deny it.
The deal's off.
And we do it under the table, so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
It's transparent, kenny.
The press'll be all over it.
6 months from now, we're not gonna care, are we?
We'll deal with it then.
Mcnamara:
At the least, it'll expose whether khrushchev has been overthrown.
We'll know who we're up against.
Well, i've been thinking about khrushchev, and if this is a move to appease the hard-liners in his government, then it may be just the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Whoever carries the message has to hit the nail on the head.
Come across as too soft, they'll push us.
Too hard, they'll be cornered, and even more dangerous.
Mccone:
All of you... all of you do understand that there is an enormous risk in offering this deal.
Because if they turn us down, and we've already told them that we're coming in on monday morning... they'll strike first.
Yes.
Bobby.
You know dobrynin best.
Yeah.
Then you're it.
President:
Ted, i want you to start working on the draft.
And, bobby, you gotta go in there.
You gotta make them understand that we have to have an answer tomorrow, because monday we go to war.
What do you want?
A good-bye kiss?
Hey, joe, listen.
I'll take care of him.
Go on inside.
Grab some coffee.
We'll be back pretty quick.
Joe:
Are you sure?
O'donnell:
Sure.
What's the matter with you?
Forget how to open a car door?
(chuckles) jesus.
You rich people.
I promised the girls i'd take them riding tomorrow.
Make sure you keep that date.
We gave up so much to get here.
I don't know.
Sometimes i think, what the hell did we do it for?
Well, i don't know about you, but i'm in it for the money.
We knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Remember?
You know, i... I... i hate being called the brilliant one, the ruthless one... the guy everybody's afraid of.
I hate it.
I'm not so smart, you know?
I'm not so ruthless.
Well, you're right... about the smart part.
I don't know if i can do this.
There's nobody else i'd rather have going in there than you... nobody else i'd trust helen and... the kids' lives to.
Take a left.
Bobby:
You smell that?
They're burning their documents.
They think we're going to war.
God help us, ken.
(elevator bell dings)
Sir, ambassador dobrynin is already here.
He's waiting in your office.
Here.
(sighs)
I'll whistle up some luck for you.
Bobby:
Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you.
(whistling)
(whistling continues)
(whistling)
(woman clears throat)
Who are you?
A friend.
(whistling)
My brother, my friends, my countrymen, and i cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational.
I promise you that.
Then i fear our 2 nations will go to war... and i fear where war will lead us.
If the missiles do not become operational, if you remove the missiles, then there will be no war.
At this moment, the president is accepting the terms of secretary khrushchev's letter of friday night.
If the soviet union halts construction immediately, removes the missiles, and submits to u.n. Inspection, the united states will pledge to never invade cuba or aid others in that enterprise.
If your jupiter missiles in turkey were removed also, such an accommodation could be reached.
(sighs)
That's not possible.
The united states cannot agree to such terms under threat.
Any belief to the contrary was in error.
You want war?
However... while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the united states can offer a private assurance.
Now, our jupiter missiles in turkey are obsolete and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time.
This withdrawal should take place within, say, 6 months.
Of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government.
This private assurance represents the word of the highest authority?
Yes.
And it can be relayed beyond comrade khrushchev's ears to the top circles of my government?
Our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khrushchev sees fit to satisfy, with the caveat that it is not to be made public in any way, shape, or form.
And we must have an answer tomorrow, at the latest.
I cannot stress this point enough.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors.
Of course.
We have heard stories that some of your military men wish for war.
You're a good man.
Your brother is a good man.
I assure you there are other good men.
Let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing that was put in motion.
What's going to happen?
If the sun comes up tomorrow, it is only because of men of goodwill.
And that's... that's all there is between us and the devil.
(radio static)
Announcer:
This is radio moscow.
Premier khrushchev has sent a message to president kennedy today.
The soviet prime minister reemphasizes the need for urgent measures to prevent a fatal turn of events and to preserve world peace.
In addition to instructions earlier transmitted to stop construction work on installations in cuba, the soviet government has ordered the dismantling of weapons in cuba, as well as their crating and return to the soviet union.
(breathes deeply)
Is everybody ready for church?
(baby mumbling)
It's a beautiful morning.
Pass the butter to dad.
Dad, you want your paper?
Dad, what's wrong?
The sun came up.
Every day the sun comes up says something about us.
What does it say, dad?
What's wrong with daddy?
(telephone rings)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(ring ring)
(people chattering)
This is the foreign policy trophy we were hoping for.
Mr. President, sir.
Mr. President, great job.
Hold it, hold it.
Well, mr.
President, i think i can speak for everyone here when i say, "bring on those midterms.
There's no stopping us now."
Man:
4 more years.
All right.
You know, it's been a long 2 weeks, and... or whatever, but... i'd like to thank you all.
I think you all did a great job, and i just think... i don't think we should be gloating too much.
It was... just as much a victory for them as it was for us.
Hear, hear.
Enjoy your morning.
Man:
Thank you, mr.
President.
Get some rest, mr.
President.
We've got a lot of new clout right now, and we can run the table on khrushchev, the middle east, and southeast asia.
Right.
You're right.
(sighs)
Dear mr.
And mrs.
Anderson, i was deeply shocked when advised your son was lost in an operational mission on saturday, october 27, 1962.
Your son rendered distinguished and dedicated service to his country throughout his career.
He was admired... and respected for his courage, his professional skill by all with whom he served.
His tragic loss will be deeply felt... and a grateful nation will be forever in his debt.
(speaking indistinctly)
Ken, we're out here.
(speaking indistinctly)
John f.
Kennedy:
What kind of a peace do we seek?
I am talking about genuine peace... the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living... not merely peace in our time, but peace in all time.
Our problems are man-made, therefore, they can be solved by man.
For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
We all breathe the same air.
We all cherish our children's future, and we are all mortal.
They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother...
Do you think I came to bring peace on earth?
I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!

DIRTY SOUL
Typical, you buy caviar and then leave it in the fridge.
And don't forget to clean the sink after you!

Teeth, a wash, get dressed, have to get a move on.
Leave it out!
Behaves like he owns the place!
Don't forget to clean the bath after you!
- Get him to leave the crap out!
- Are you creating again?
Be civil to him.
Thanks.
He likes you.
Only in order to make himself comfortable here!
He is at home here, so learn to live with it already!
Things are hunky-dory and I won't let you mess it up, OK?
It was great when the two of us were alone!
I don't want to be alone.
Sorry.
Suits him.
As always.
Let's go, we must move.
Sis...
- Know anyone?
- Those are the lovers.
Mum found his diary.
The last one was number 322.
That's her in white.
Who is it?
Don't know.
- You'll get diabetes, stop it.
- Give me a ciggie.
- Just pass it over double quick!
- Do you mind...
You can pick up the urn there, I paid for it.
He divorced me 'cos of you, so, you can kindly keep him.
- But I've nowhere to put him!
- Didn't he buy you a studio ?
at?
- Won't take up much space now.
- Excuse me, can I take him?
- And who are you?
- I'm his son, Vladimir...
DNA confirmed he was my father
He kept it secret from you, but it no longer matters, does it?
So, we're all counted and correct.
My condolences!
Girls, let's go!
Take it to the second-hand dealer.
Keys, Jana!
Drive carefully.
- Give me the note!
- We'll all meet up at home!
Take that chocolate from her!
Dad seemed sort of content that it's all over.
According to the diary it was quite a feat.
Are you coming to buy Jan a present?
Well, now...
- What's the celebration?
- Five years' anniversary.
- Hang on, back in a sec.
- OK.
- Here.
- Thanks.
I'm coming.
Hello.
- Hiya.
Whose car?
- Inheritance from dad.
Open it then.
Under the steering-wheel.
It's an old banger, but, at least, a diesel one.
- What will you sell it for?
- Don't know, thirty...
Look out!
May be thirty-five.
Only because it's you, though.
Give us a call, you have the number.
Wait, have to complete the papers.
Can't we meet up in the evening and sign it?
Still loves you, hey?
- Come back soon love.
- I'll be back.
-No problem.
Girls!
Beautiful or what?
Do you like it?
- Hello.
- Hi.
You changed the locks?
Yep.
- Hi.
- Something up?
-No.
Nothing.
- What's she saying?
- Did you buy the Pokemon's?
Forgot...
But I promise I'll buy them.
- Have a coffee?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you ring me?
- My dad died.
Got cremated today.
So, I wanted to see you both.
I know it sounds bad but you hardly knew him, right?
- Shall I play it?
-A fairy-tale?
- Little Red Riding Hood?
- What's she saying?
- Seems you stink like the wolf.
- Bought the washing-machine yet?
- Not yet.
Hallo?
Yes, who is it?
Mrs. Turkova, credit cards.
Is Mr. Rames at home?
No, he's at a Trade Fair.
- Has his card been stolen?
- Sorry?
The card was used in Paris.
Mainly on woman's clothing.
- The account is deeply in the red.
- What?
In debt.
The hotel nor dinner at the Moulin Rouge is covered.
- But my husband is in Brno.
- Should we block the card?
I don't know.
He'll be back in the evening.
He'll ring you.
- Thank you.
Good bye.
- Bye bye.
- Did you get the car at least?
- Not even the ashes.
- Here's the sugar.
- Thanks.
- Marcel, I...
- Milk as well.
I want to come back to you.
How long is it that you screamed that you are suffocating with us?
You never learned Natalie's sign language properly.
Sorry, but there's no sense in it.
Do you have anything for breakfast?
Sure.
Some biscuits and milk.
- Hello, Jana.
- Hi.
Celebrating something?
Wait!
Jesus.
It's today!
Fuck, I completely forgot.
How were things in Brno?
What?
The German contract didn't get signed 'til the afternoon...
- Sorry.
- That's OK.
- There's a present on the table.
- Hm.
Thanks very much.
That's beautiful.
Thank you.
- I've got something for you too.
- You needn't have.
That was really nice.
Much better than ever before.
Yep.
Do you think it's because we're divorced?
- Or there's no feeling left?
- Not sure, but...
You were wonderful.
I wanted to be the best wife in the world,
I was nervous with you even in bed.
Have you got anybody now?
I feel ashamed.
Would you believe it, someone from over the net.
- What?
- Sounds crazy, doesn't it?
I feel like a schoolgirl.
We've exchanged some two hundred e-mails.
They're beautiful long letters.
Above all they're sincere.
I feel good.
The allergy's gone and my rash has disappeared.
- But how?
- You departed.
It seems I was allergic to you.
Your smell, to your presence.
- Hang on, allergic?
To me?
- The consultant said so.
Someone is allergic to cats, to dogs,
I've got it with you.
- That's a bit weird, isn't it?
- Yes.
With dogs and cats I can understand, but am I a dog?
That's absurd.
Surely didn't spend seven years with a dog.
You're here two hours and I'm scratching already.
So what is it?
You know what?
I lied.
Again I was forced to lie to you.
Leave it!
I have to lie because you have absolutely no liking for sex.
Please, just leave it!
Normal women don't mind popping a few or a bit of oral.
- You get sick just from yolk.
- You're revolting!
You know this is what I hate!
Your excessive bloody hygiene!
That's where you get your rash!
I threw the cake out.
You didn't even touch it.
Next time buy it in the shop.
- Didn't you like the taste?
- Just burned it a bit.
- You weren't anywhere near Brno
- What are you talking about?
As a result of your Parisian fling your card nearly got blocked.
Where did you think this up?
That's a bunch of nonsense.
Then tell me what happened.
What?
What is it?
Boss went to Paris in the end.
Because he forgot his card he asked me if he could borrow mine.
- You think that...?
- How can you know what I think?
I only think that you think...
- What do I think?
- You probably think that I was in Paris and bought things for someone else.
Yeah, you were there with your lover and bought her presents.
- You're afraid to admit it, OK?
- With what lover?
- You assumed I wouldn't find out?
- That's nonsense!
You thought I was that stupid that I would sit here and wash your underwear'?
I've had enough of your crap!
She was on the glacier with you in the spring, now in Paris!
You know that I was there alone!
You rang round like a detective.
Sure, they all went red, didn't look me in the eye and stammered.
I'm ashamed you can't ski.
You snowplough and fall off the lift!
And where should I have learned?
In the kitchen?
At least I know you're unfaithful!
I'm surprised I haven't caught something from you!
- Give it a rest, that's absurd.
- You know what's absurd?
At home you're almost impotent and you hump away elsewhere.
- Leave me alone and go to bed!
- Don't touch me!
It's my ?
at as well and I can do whatever I want here!
Just realize how many guys such a woman has had!
I've had enough!
Shit!
You asked for it!
Is that the way to hold a fork?
Hold it properly.
Don't dare put it in the washer!
Don't gulp!
It won't disappear.
Let her, she won't make a model anyway, right?
Should do some sport!
Look at her figure!
She should study or else they'll kick her out of the High School.
All day she stares at the wall and gobbles chocolate.
That's OK?
Your dad doesn't pass away every day.
Leave her be.
And I planned how I would look after you, care for you...
But I never want it to end this way.
And you think that I do?
I look forward to you giving me a beating?
- I'll never do it again.
- That's what you always say.
Really, I won't ever do it.
I'll swear on whatever you want.
This is how it ends up.
My bum is purple for three days.
You always said:
We have the same names, Jana and Jan.
That's no coincidence.
You want to get a divorce?
Sleep, it's late.
It hurts really bad.
And I'm cold.
Warm me up.
- Haven't slept like this for ages.
- Sleep.
Don't dare and tum your back again.
What's up?
I know that your father died but we're short of numbers!
If all goes smoothly I'll be back on Monday.
Smoothly?
The cremation is over I thought.
I have some woman's things I have to sort out.
You're driving me crazy.
Make sure you're here on Monday!
DIVORCE PETITIONS
MEET IN AN HOUR BY THE PLAYGROUND.
LYLYLY
Hi, it's me.
I must tell you that I can't make it today.
Out of the question.
Have to meet.
I'm counting on it.
OK, in an hour by the playground.
See you.
So, I'll buy some cheese and tights in Amsterdam.
Two beige and one pair with a black lace, a g-string, perfume.
Hello, Susie, see you at the playground.
Who do you keep talking to?
Hurry up or I'll miss the plane.
- I'll bring you a drinkie poo!
- For God's sake, let's go!
- What time shall we meet?
- I'm not sure, Alenka.
Have to go to the Ministry.
I'll ring, OK?
Ciao.
But tomorrow back to normal.
- Bye, bye doctor.
- Good bye.
Yesterday I met Jacob on the stairs.
Invited me to a party...
MUST NOT EAT CHOCOLATE!
Good morning.
Sit down.
Let me introduce a new student.
His name is David.
I hope you will help him with everything.
Go and sit there.
They kicked him out of the German school.
Grew pot in the cellar.
A lovely gift.
- Have you told him?
- No, I want it to be a surprise.
I don't know.
So much money...
You'd get a new kitchen or a holiday for it.
And it hurts.
This is my last chance.
- Hi.
- Hiya.
Go and play.
Here's his snack.
You'll see me by half eight.
Owe you, Susie.
Go on!
- Wait!
Here...
- Yep.
Thinking of you.
It's him!
- Hello, Jan!
- Hello.
Surviving then.
See the car and think to myself... is it you?
- How are you?
- Me?
On the go all the time.
Fancy a drink sometime?
Karin's curled up at home as ever.
I'll get her out.
Take care.
Ciao.
- Wait.
I have say something.
- Awful pins and needles in my legs.
Go to the studio flat.
We can't.
I gave the key back.
Truth's out that I wasn't in Brno.
- Have to go home.
- No, you don't.
Won't be at home.
For three days she is meant to sleep with us.
- Where is she?
- Not jealous by any chance?
- She got somebody?
- You surprised?
Let's go!
Wait!
Get a move on!
- Good day.
- A good'un.
Jan!
- What's up, dad?
- Nothing.
- Football's started, that's all.
- I know.
Thanks, dad.
Just move on to the table.
Don't be afraid, It'll be all right.
We'll begin.
You've come to the screen just in time...
Hello, Jan. I'll sleep over at Karins'.
I'll call back.
These perpetual rivals have a super technique and are physically on song.
Let them surprise us.
The first pass is directed at the opposition captain.
See his superb body movement and admire his ball skills.
He's entered the penalty area.
He is really at home there.
Look out!
One mustn't forget the visitors' double substitution.
Meantime, the visitors have re-started.
Adams jumps in hard.
He held the defender but maybe, it was all a bit over-aggressive.
Play is beginning to get physical.
Home side is kicking from goal and starts a new counter-attack.
Brilliant interchange and it seems they're going for goal.
Ryan Giggs is getting there.
The center could be aimed for him.
That's right.
And the visitors' backs commit a foul.
Penalty.
And it's a goal.
Quiet, quiet!
The home side is leading 1:0 and seem to retain their appetite.
In such heat blood boils.
Quiet, don't shout!
Quiet, quiet, keep...
Keep quiet!
Are you crazy?
Nearly choked me!
In Paris you didn't seem to push my head into the pillow.
What's it like lying in your best friends' bed?
You should have kept the studio flat.
- It's him.
- He must have a sixth sense.
Shut up!
Shit!
Jana complained you only make love when you give her a beating.
- Some kind of novelty?
- Rubbish.
Just nonsense.
It's not the first time...
In this family it's the only form of communication.
Hear it?
Don't walk around in your underwear!
He's your dad now.
Well, get him to learn to knock when entering my room!
- Don't lie!
Come here...
- No chance!
- Don't make things up!
- Look at yourself in the mirror!
Shit!
Well, you've gone over the top this time!
- Open up!
- Kicking Ema, bloody ignoramus!
Behave decently towards him!
I'm asking you nicely...
He'll leave you anyway like all the ones before.
Leave me alone!
- Have you told her'?
- Not yet.
-How come?
- Wasn't the right moment.
- That's what you say all the time.
- We're like two corpses...
- Quiet!
Just belt up!
- Listen to me for a sec!
- Christ, they heard us!
Wait here!
- Jan...
- And be quiet!
- She's locked herself in!
- What's up?
- Who?
- She's standing in the window!
- Please help or she'll jump!
- Jump where?
Wait!
Bugger!
- She's upstairs!
Come on!
- OK.
Jesus Christ!
I've had it up to here with your family!
- Open up!
- Annie, it's me, Jan!
Hurry up and open or I'll kick the door down!
Let her jump!
Bet she won't.
Just play acting.
Annie, dear, I'm stressed out, it's all too much for me.
Please, let me inside!
Please...
Annie... open up, please...
- Come in.
But just you.
- Annie, it's me, Jan.
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
- You don't love me.
- You know full well I love you.
- You're lying.
- I swear.
- Well, they didn't hear us.
- I fancy a steak.
And I don't care if somebody sees us.
Let's go!
Karin dearie, please stay here.
I'll cook a steak.
I'm defrosting the meat.
It'll be bloody the way you like it.
Damn!
- It's Jana!
- Take it then.
- It's Jana!
- Well, take it.
- She's meant to be at your place!
- Well?
!
Not answering.
You had it done because of him, right?
My one said if I get my breasts made smaller he'll leave me.
Do you get it?
- Likes you the way you are.
- Just being jealous.
With this I can't bar-dance.
That's what it's all about.
- Well, I envy you.
- What?
The breasts?
No.
Hello, Susie, was he good?
- No problem and had breakfast.
- Where you off to?
Wait!
Look at your place and the state of you.
An unhealthy lifestyle.
You're just skin and bone.
Go and find a real woman with a ?
at.
Everything'll change after the show.
I'll go and paint in New Guinea.
There are tribes living in the trees.
I'll be one of them.
Without any civilization.
It's a lost paradise.
Stay here.
With your luck they'll gobble you up.
And you have a kid.
- Young madam, you've dropped this.
- Thank you...
Hugo, get up and don't scream.
You hear, don't cry!
Hugo, don't scream!
Give it a rest!
Hi!
I'm home!
What's up?
Hello.
Where were you?
Why didn't you answer the phone?
I was in the supermarket
But I called all night.
Mobile as well as the main line.
Charger's in the car and cleaner knocked the phone from the socket.
I have a splitting headache, migraine.
Take Hugo to the nursery.
He's ready.
Authors of tragedies.
Most famous are Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides.
They sourced their subjects from man's relationship with society...
That one went out with all 4th years.
Totally shagged out.
You can pour a liter of wine into that one in the black T-shirt.
- What about the one next to her'?
- Futile case.
A virgin.
- What?
- Look at that ass!
No surprise!
- No chance, won't give...
- Rubbish!
Fucks only in her head, in Spy magazine.
Waiting for her prince.
Aeschylus, born 525 BC, well-known as the author of trilogies, the most famous being Oresteia, the only surviving...
- Who keeps messaging you?
- Girl-friends.
Do you mind?
Oh, I get, so, excited by your fee ties, toes, petite ankles...
I told you clearly!
When you start doing a bit of body-building and one sees results!
You know what it's called?
"Tyrant Fitness"!
I'll never be a Schwarzenegger, come to terms with it.
There's skin on top.
You know I can't stand it.
That's because you didn't stir it.
Off to the solarium and opera!
You won't get me there today!
Can't stand the squealing horrors!
Take some aspirin and vitamins.
- Let me be!
- You'll feel better!
- Sorry, loo paper has run out...
- Give me peace at least here!
- Who's texting you all the time?
- That's from work, sorry.
Where did you get the money?
Saved it up.
You shouldn't have done it.
You won't make a model anyway.
That's not the point.
- Lunch!
- Thank you.
-Enjoy it.
Thanks a lot.
We could have got a home cinema for the money.
You want some?
You know when you fed me like this the last time?
Yeah, I remember.
When I believed you were pregnant.
We didn't even exchange rings you were in such a hurry.
I have to go for a pee.
- Should I call the nurse?
- No.
- I have to be off.
- It'll only take a sec.
Carefully!
Where's the prince?
Move your ass, fattie!
Get a move on!
Meat machine!
Look at her!
Rhino!
- Let's play, forget about her...
- Hi.
How much I owe?
We're broke...
You can baby-sit Hugo in return.
You don't realize how glad I am to have you.
Hang on, don't be stupid.
That was a mad one-off then.
Sorry.
You don't realize...
You don't realize how guys get on my nerves!
They give me the creeps.
I'd be better off alone or with somebody like you.
What would we miss?
Darling!
I'm home!
There was a bomb at the airport!
We can go to the cinema!
Don't bother taking shoes off and get Hugo.
I have a headache.
Well, move!
Hi...
Good afternoon, hello!
Good afternoon.
What's up?
What you thinking?
That I've come at a bad time!
Look, just get Hugo or come and join us!
Let's go, it's OK.
- Sorry.
- No need.
Well, what shall we have?
Come on.
Help yourself.
- I don't eat it.
- You don't like sweet stuff?
Why?
Just not my taste.
You have to sweeten life up a bit.
My old man also died.
I know.
Take some!
- Well, I'll just taste it.
- Plus, mom went crazy.
She's thought up she wants a kid.
At thirty-five!
Great, hey?
Sorry, sis.
- Hi, what you doing!
- Stupid cow.
Shit, can't see anything.
Bitch... a lesbian...
- Bitch, lesbian...
- What's that?
Don't say that.
- Bitch, lesbian...
- Don't say that!
Training for the Olympics?
What are you doing here?
I come here to smoke.
Want some?
- Not now.
- Now, now, you've never...
- Like what...?
- Like never properly got stoned?
I smoke with my sis all the time.
I've been waiting for you for ages.
Ema!
Ema!
Don't avoid me.
I've managed to sell just one.
The smallest one.
Thanks.
So long.
Jana!
Why are you sitting here?
Let's go!
- Get a move on or we'll be late.
- Noticed anything?
What like?
Been to the hairdresser?
Look...
You wouldn't rather put on something else?
- Hiya!
- Hello.
- This is Karin and that is Alice.
- Pleased to meet you.
What are you wearing?
Good God...
Well, enjoy yourselves.
Thanks...
Well mate, I'm fed up with everything.
- I feel like... an idiot.
- What's up?
- Look at her!
- At who?
At Karin, of course!
Look!
Noticed what muscles she has?
Don't you think she looks a bit like a guy?
What?
That she has something masculine.
- Get away.
- Look properly.
She's doing the dirty on me.
- No kidding!
With who?
- With a female.
In the end I've been tricked by a woman.
Do you get it?
Still better than being tricked by a guy.
If I divorce her I'll lose Hugo.
He's not yours anyway.
Well yes, but I love him.
Like my own.
Look at her!
See those eyes?
How can you trust them?
All the same your wife's here.
Enough to make you puke!
- It'll all be all right.
- They're all the same!
Come here...
Good evening.
Hello.
- DA, thanks.
- Gut
- What's wrong?
- Don't know.
Something I ate.
You had that done because of him?
Yep.
But I don't think it was effective.
I think he's got a bit on the side.
Say something to you?
Or Franta?
No.
Maybe you're keeping quiet.
Are you still arguing?
Lately, not so much.
He's become kind of civil lately.
It seems to me like he's not sure what he should do.
I'm terribly jealous.
I want to know what she does better than me.
I am capable of listening in, reading his text messages, etc...
I know I am stupid but I just can't help it.
Who loves terribly, gets terribly jealous.
That's normal
- In that case, Jan never loved me.
- Because he had no reason.
I would never do that.
Think of yourself.
No one else will do it for you.
Let's go!
- You can give me some money?
- Why?
For hotel.
My son needing sleeping.
- Did you send the money there?
- No, I didn't.
I was there!
Nothing on the account.
Next stop New Prosek.
You prick yourself?
No.
- We must keep enough for food.
- You just can't hang on to cash!
- You actually driving?
- Of course I'm taxiing.
If not here, likely on the road.
Look, this is not the first time you've done this to me...
Don't touch me!
Good enough for that, am I?
I've had enough!
Annie, open UP!
Be careful!
Watch it!
Don't knock dad over!
- Don't go!
- Sleep, I here with you!
It's on the way, I'm here.
Everything OK.
Your son like beet.
Well, a beaut more like.
Her... who is she?
That is my wife, ex...
End.
Finite.
Well... and why?
Because... because we know...
each other from High School, we said it all, we understood each other, discussed it...
And why ending then - why finite?
She was allergic to me.
I was her terrier.
- You understand?
-No.
- I also don't understand.
- And she?
Who is she?
- Kind of lover, understand?
- Lover?
- Lover...
With her nothing but sex.
Also bloody useless because you couldn't discuss anything with her.
How you say in Russian hard-luck artist.
Understand?
- I'm a poor son...
- You one durak.
Exactly.
An idiot - spot on.
Good night.
Hang on, I...
- That was her?
- That was Karel from work.
At half past twelve at night?
OK, it was her.
- What did she want?
- Don't know.
You could be a bit more tolerant.
- In what?
- Well, in everything.
I am sure if you knew each other you would understand each other.
- Where would this understanding be?
- In everything.
You'd see if all three of us would be here...
- Live together?
You, I and her'?
- No, that's not what I meant.
I shopped, washed, ironed.
I organized the holiday, cinema, underwear.
What harm did I do to you?
- Go to bed.
It's no use.
- I took you to mix with the elite.
You saw the world with me.
America, Thailand...
You wanted something and I said OK, just go and buy it.
You wanted to be a model.
I bought you a nose and had your ears sewn.
- Shouldn't have done it!
- But why not?
- I wanted to!
- Well, don't complain then!
But...
Look at yourself!
You look like a used tire!
- You realize what you've proposed?
- Sleep, it was a stupid idea.
What would you feel if I told you that a lover of mine would live here with us?
That's different, isn't it?
You don't have anybody else.
How do you know?
May be I've had loads of lovers.
- You just don't know.
- Garbage!
- Not even interested in who it was?
- Who was it?
Not sure because there were that many.
But I really loved one of them and left him because of you.
- What a cow I am!
- Who was it?
Do I know him?
- Yes, you do.
- Who is it?
He's really friendly.
You'll get on.
You'll cook together, you'll have children for me, that'll be a laugh!
- Who is it?
Give it here!
- Four of us will live together!
- Give that mobile here!
- What's LY?
Like love you?
You're a couple of morons, how low!
That's all you can manage?
This?
- Well, you're a real sucker!
- Waste of time!
Good night you...
- You sucker!
- Cow!
One big moron!
- What's up?
- That's sis.
Used to play up with mum until she was ready for the loonie-bin.
How do you know you want me and not somebody else?
I love you.
At first sight.
Why?
I don't have a decent figure, not clever either.
Sometimes I feel totally unwanted.
Well.
You've got beautiful...
hair.
Lovely, red.
Not here, I'd wish it was somewhere else.
By the sea.
The moon above with stars.
The wind rustles the sea murmurs.
You sleep?
No.
Niet
You hear!
I'll jump!
It's on your conscience!
Careful you don't fall!
Don't do it, you'll break a leg!
Jump and don't make such noise!
One can't even get to sleep!
- Just leave them, dad...
- Where did you crawl out of?
Dad, please, just leave them and go to bed.
Bye, bye!
Mommy!
Mum, where are you?
Mommy, come quick here!
I'm coming...
My God...
Little moment...
What's up?
- Mom, where you were?
- I'm here.
Sleep, just bad dream.
You have.
Sleep so...
- Yelena!
- Sleep well.
Sorry!
Pour tea!
Pot on the kitchen board!
Good.
DA.
I'll be there after ten.
So long.
That's nothing.
What this?
Mom, pennies...
I bought you Russian bakes!
Like home.
Sex on-line?
Yelena!
OK, I'm coming!
- Is he here?
- No.
I'll help you clean.
Looked like you'd kill each other last night.
- Look what he did to me.
- Yeah, love sometimes hurts.
If you were a proper father you'd talk to him.
Shit, went down like lead.
In three days got fever, 40 plus.
Sweated like a pig.
Then came here and everything was fucked.
Next!
- Why do you insist on a blood test?
- I sat on a needle.
On a used needle.
And that's not all.
I had intercourse...
probably with a prostitute and the contact was probably...
for sure unprotected.
Totally.
Congrats.
I fully share your concern but you'll have to wait.
We'll know in three months when the antibodies form
Antibodies.
But I need to know straight away!
Should have behaved differently!
See you in three months!
Sister, next one!
Jana, now now...
Had a reason?
You mean there can be a reason to beat the shit out of a woman?
He didn't mean it.
If you were kinder to me I could think of repaying you.
You're just like him!
- Just move out the two of you!
- Why should I move?
My money was included when you bought this love-nest!
You could be more grateful!
I've stepped on your glasses.
- What did you say?
- That I stepped on your glasses.
- On what?
- On glasses.
- Lay on the floor.
Didn't see them.
- You've broken my glasses!
- Didn't want to do it.
- Damn, where's the booster?
You don't even remember any more where you put things.
- Moreover, you're deaf.
-What?
- You're deaf as a door-post.
And I curse the day I met your son!
Just feel free and give me one just like him!
I don't beat women.
Put the bucket away and clear out!
I've ended up like an animal.
I just exist.
So, it's ended up as usual.
Except that he's left for real.
The fact is that our make-ups were always so beautiful.
I don't know what to do.
I'll prescribe stronger medicine.
No, I'm not off my rocker!
I'll give you Deprex 80 just to be on the safe side.
It's broken.
- Uncle will repair it.
- Give it here.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Karin!
Karin, open UP!
- What if he breaks the door down?
- No worry!
They're security doors.
- Open it!
I'll kick them down!
- I'm pregnant.
- With me?
- Who else?
- You don't take precautions?
- You've beaten them.
- How?
You've stopped, right?
- No, I've read about it.
When you're unfaithful you make twice as much sperm than normal.
It's scientifically proved.
- You're not pleased?
- Oh, I am...
Main thing is you have to sort it with Jana quickly and gently.
We could buy her a studio flat and move in to your house.
What do you think?
Karin!
Damn!
- What is it?
- Can I come in?
Rushing off to the tanning bed, come in.
- You off somewhere?
- Just told you.
What's wrong?
I'm divorcing him.
Give it a break.
You always say that.
But I mean it this time.
Our marriage is worthless.
Right from the start.
You should have children.
I'd be a grannie but it would help you.
Let there be children!
Only a divorce will help now.
- Do it and stop talking about it.
- I'm not as impetuous as you.
I want to sell this house.
I need my own ?
at.
You've gone bananas!
I sold my flat to move in here!
I have a right!
I'm not happy here.
All of a sudden.
I warned you I married him because of you
- You had your own mind set.
- Well yep, just out of spite.
- Because of me?
- Naturally.
I married the first guy just in order not to have to witness your love affairs.
- Look, stop being hysterical!
- Give me back what you've taken!
- For God's sake, what did I take?
- Childhood, growing up.
Enough?
- Your screwed-up life is my fault?
- Yeah.
And I'll never forgive you.
- For what, for Christ's sake?
- Your lovers' o ogling.
One of them tried to rape me, or don't you remember?
And I kicked him out as a result.
You remember that?
I remember.
Lookie here sweetheart, I have a right to my own life too.
Why is it always on my account?
How could I have been so dumb?
Get lost!
Come back when you recover!
I'll never recover!
Jana?
Hi.
Just coming for my things.
Have you anything to eat?
I am terribly hungry.
Please.
- Good day!
- What?
Hi.
You coming living here?
- Fourteen?
- DA.
Mum, mum!
Here new next door!
Sometimes it hurt but it was beautiful.
You forced me to say that I was the sunshine of your life, I said:
I am your sunshine.
I didn't force you.
But you always pressed my head into the pillow and said otherwise
- you'll give me a beating.
- It wasn't like that.
But I didn't mind.
I felt I belonged to someone.
Until then I didn't belong to anyone.
Until you came.
Except that you didn't care.
Did you ever love me?
After five years the honeymoon is over.
It's just a scratch.
How should I get to meet men?
You were always a maestro at it.
Well perhaps...
You have to kind of...
Simply you have to look at a guy... and give him a bit of courage.
Try it.
Don't look at me like a dog!
You have to be... sexy.
Sparkle in the eye.
Get it?
You have to encourage him.
Force him to get up and come over and say...
Something.
Try it.
You know what, go and buy the dog.
Hopeless cases do it like you.
I'm not an actress like you.
I don't want to play anything...
- OK, I'm off.
Ciao!
- Wait!
- Why are you painted like that?
- I'm taking Ema out for a walk.
Why is she made up like that?
I picked the holiday, cinema, underwear.
And finally she told me that she finds me totally repulsive!
Well, you are a durak.
- Try Russian pastry?
Please...
- No, not now thanks.
I'm on this at the moment.
Take yourselves...
- It is banana?
- Yep, banana flavor.
- Time off to work.
- To work?
DA.
Yours?
Good bye.
Pleasant evening...
- That's Annie.
- Hello!
Where did you disappear off to before?
Take it easy, give it here.
- Give me a smoke.
- David!
- Let's move on!
- Chill out!
Two Red-bull and vodkas!
Mind, you'll get the dog stoned!
David!
- I'm off!
- Where to?
Annie!
Emmie!
We're off home.
Hi, Karin, I've got something for you.
Come down, will you?
- Excuse me, do you have a jack?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- What is it?
Wait!
Give it here!
Give it back!
You left something behind, my good friend!
What're you doing?
You're mad!
My good friend...
You don't have your own husband?
You don't have your own?
Stop it, Jana, stop it!
- You OK?
- What're you doing here?
Stop it!
Damn it!
- What are you doing here?
- Just leave it alone!
Jana, well now!
- You nearly killed me!
- You're a nutcase.
- Do you want to call a taxi?
- I'll get my own.
- Lend me some money.
- I'm broke.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
David, come back with me.
Mom won't say a word.
- Can't.
I have to go back.
- Why?
-They're waiting for me.
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.
Put some spinach on it, it'll help.
- Mum, wait until I fall asleep.
- Of course, I will.
Sleep...
Hi.
Good afternoon, can I speak with Yelena Obrazcov?
- This is a private ?
at.
- I know.
I was told I could find her here.
Can I speak to her'?
Well, I'll take a peep.
Sorry, she's not here.
Come here.
I have to speak to her.
Do you know if she's healthy?
Yelena you mean?
No, she's disappeared.
Seems doesn't have a visa because of some check-up.
I don't have to explain what kind of check-up, right?
So long.
- Where were you?
- None of your business.
Don't be cheeky.
Tell me where you were.
Your eyes look weird.
- I need some money.
For pills.
- Are you ill?
Not ill really.
Need a morning-after pill, that's all.
- What?
- Don't want to end up like you.
If I was like you, you wouldn't be here!
In case of death or accident your wife and daughter gets five hundred thousand.
The insurance payment will be paid in two installments.
Please come and sign.
Also sign on oath that you are not aware of any illness.
- Are you all right?
- Nothing, got the runs.
Otherwise, I'm healthy as an ox.
What's up?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- Something's got into them.
- Richard!
- Yeah!
- Let's go and buy the cot!
- I have a customer here.
Were you parking?
She's come back then?
I'll ring the bell when it's ready.
Couldn't you test drive it with me?
I think it needs tuning up.
- I regret it.
- What?
Well, that I never went out with you.
Why did you come today?
All the while I can only think of you.
Wait, this won't do.
Why?
I want it differently than you.
- What do you mean?
- Well, like...
We can see each other but you mustn't fall in love with me, OK?
What?
Try to understand.
I have a wife and we are expecting a child.
Sex is sex and a relationship...
- How do you know it's your child?
- Please, leave it alone!
You're a poor bastard!
She lays it at your door and you come running?
- Hang on, you know something?
- Everyone knows, except you!
- Just crap!
- Go on admit it!
While you lay under the car she was lying under somebody else.
- Shut up!
- You think the kid will change it?
- I feel sorry for you.
- Shit, shut up!
Daddy!
Can you tell us, Jacob?
- No time today?
- No.
And now:
If I had known I would have invited you.
Write down the right answer in your exercise book.
Family, pig.
Pig, toys...
Toys, toys...
Toys, toys...
I brought you the Pokemon's.
- Hi there.
- Hello.
- Keeping well?
- Yes.
What about you?
Yes, no problem.
- Suits you.
- Thanks.
Haven't changed your mind?
- Mr. and Mrs. Rames?
- Yes.
Come in.
What the hell?
Hey!
Where did you get the money from?
Steal it?
They'll lock you up!
No.
Are you ill?
Liar!
You won't die on me, will you...
I love you lots.
You have to be nice to mom now.
Switch the mobile on!
Mom!
Do you know what's worst?
When everything's up the creek I'd rather tum the clock back.
You know, me too.
They all stare at my breasts.
They all say:
Look, how they're sticking out.
- I'm saving for another operation.
- No, that would be a pity.
- I'm off.
- No hurry is there?
- We said for a last drink.
- Well, finish it.
- Wait.
- I can't.
Merry X and Happy New and all that.
Can I give you a kiss?
I have to walk the dog.
Bye.
- Can I call you sometime?
- No.
Really no.
- Hi.
- Hello.
All the best.
- How are you doing?
- OK, thanks.
-Who is it?
- How you doing, man?
- Hello, Frantisek.
- Hello.
- Where have you been?
Nothing's running, nothing works.
I just don't know what's up.
What's that on your face?
Whose work is it?
- Please, just go to sleep.
- But mobiles still work, right?
- Who's texting you?
- Probably Karel from work, right?
- Naturally, it's Karel.
- I'm asking you who it is!
- Karel, OK?
- So, it's Karel, yeah?
Sleep and keep quiet!
Leave me alone!
You bastard, now may be you'll remember who's texting you!
You crazy?
Shit!
That hurts!
Don't you dare touch me!
I'm pregnant, you disgusting asshole!
Jerk!
That hurts, stop it you cow!
Why did you bother with me?
Here it is.
- I'm negative?
- What did you expect?
Just get lost, you asshole!
Leave the car here!
It's registered in my name!
- I bought it, understand?
- Look at yourself!
You swine!
Hello.
- Hello.
- I came to say goodbye.
I've brought you maintenance for two years.
I've sold the studio.
- Have you anything left?
- Yes.
Enough for an air-fare.
- Did you bring me the Pokemon's?
- I forgot.
- Where you jetting off?
- To New Guinea.
To paint.
Will you bring them tomorrow?
No.
I'm leaving.
I'll send you the parrot.
I don't want the parrot!
Why not?
You were always after him.
I want dad to stay with us here!
What time is the flight?
In the evening.
- So long.
- Bye.
Go and get him!
Call him back!
Come on, we'll start with the fish.
Someone's ringing the bell.
It's dad!
He's come back...
Maybe he's just left something...
Do you have anything for dinner?
Open it!
Damn it, open the door!
Shit!
Mum, open up, it's Santa...
Santa is not due till evening.
Go and play.
Just give me a few slaps if I think to date a guy again.
Fuck!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
All the Seasons' Greetings!
I assumed I missed you.
Instead of presents I packed my cases.
- Off to the mountains?
- Not really.
My partner opted to spend Christmas elsewhere with somebody else.
- Right.
Sorry about that.
- Don't mention it.
Get a move on boys!
Come!
Freddie!
Balloon!
And what about you?
Do you fancy trying out my salad to see whether it's turned out OK?
Good idea.
In return you can taste my fish soup.
- Sounds good.
- I made it for the first time.
That looks like a sign it was meant to happen.
Well, what's up with you?
Get your skates on!
No time to play hard to get.
Come on, we'll get dinner... subtitles created for MAGIC BOX by A W studio Praha, 2005
Today I walk in here not as a resident, but as chief.
Chief resident.
Chief Resident Dorian.
Chiefy-chiefy-chief.
What's that, your new cool guy walk?
No.
I have rocks in my shoe.
Wow!
That's a lot of rocks!
I gotta stop taking that shortcut through the quarry.
Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.
Chief resident in the house.
- Everybody say, "Hey!"
- Hey!
Though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed because he was flying high on crystal meth, his respect felt good.
It's the reason I keep voting for him.
Have a good day.
Try not to torture anyone so much
- that they take their own lives.
- I'll try.
You're not looking as processed and overly-medicated as usual.
- That is so sweet.
- Come here.
It was the same old Dr Cox and Jordan.
The weird thing was, there was something underneath it.
They were happy.
We have some very exciting news.
Don't tell me.
You and Sweaty Teddy here are gonna finally have that commitment ceremony?
Even if I went that way, and there were nights in the service when it didn't sound far-fetched,
- Ted is hardly my type.
- I beg to differ.
I've seen Enid.
- What?
- Nothing.
Dr Cox, remember a few years back, you asked me to look over your divorce papers to make sure "that slag would die a penniless whore"?
Sorry.
It's OK. "Slag" is kind of his pet name for me.
Anyway, I was also going through a divorce.
She's with my brother now.
He's nine inches shorter than me, but he wears a piece.
The point is, you and I signed the wrong papers, which technically means you two are still married and so am I.
Well, mazeltovs all around.
I'd never seen Dr Cox and Jordan speechless before.
It was neato.
Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches.
So from now on, I'm gonna be your britches-shrinker.
Is that supposed to intimidate me?
No.
I had to do it anyway.
What reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?
Thanks, bro.
Any other questions, smart guy?
Whassup, ladies?
What's up with these rocks?
- You've been gravelled!
- Gravelled?
It's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.
- I like it.
- Better than Play-Doh Pants?
Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
Wise.
It felt good cheering Turk up.
Now I'm Chief Studly, I was making a lot more money than him.
Needless to say, it was a time to be extra sensitive.
Remember I make more money than you?
Here's five bucks for remembering.
I was thinking about spending some extra ducats on one of those classy suits we wanted.
The leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in Raw?
- You know it.
- That's cold.
I gotta go.
I got a new attending and he hates it when we're late.
- Plus, he's a question talker.
- What's a question talker?
Do I want you to be on time, Dr Turk?
Yes, I do.
Am I going to remember this?
Of course I am.
Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages removed now.
You mean "dashboard face"?
Yeah, I think she prefers Miss Myers.
She shouldn't be checking her e-mail while driving 90 mph.
- Sorry I'm late.
- We weren't waiting for you.
Great, I'm on time.
As a psychiatrist I should be there when Miss Myers' bandages get removed,
Her accident was traumatic enough, but with reconstructive facial surgery on top of that?
In my professional opinion, "Yikes!"
If you are coming in, I just might go ahead and phone up my pool man and my architect so we can populate the room with useless people.
Great!
My mom's in town.
Should I call her?
That was good.
OK, I'm gonna get these bandages off and make sure the plastic surgeons have left your face as beautiful as it always was.
You're so nice.
Are you married?
He is as of this morning.
I thought he was divorced.
No, the papers didn't go through.
You know what?
I've got a son,
I don't fantasise about Jordan dying as much anymore, and even though it wasn't planned, I'm actually happy about the way this marriage thing has worked out, so please stop your chirping and step away from my personal life.
- So, what's his wife like?
- So scary.
You go ahead and have a look there.
Wow.
You look fantastic.
You do.
Doctor?
Really fantastic.
Thank God you were here.
Since Elliot and I are both chief residents,
I'm trying not to make it all about me.
John Dorian, chief resident.
You know, unless it's someone I could doink.
You need to move your car.
It's my day to have the parking spot.
You have a scooter.
Why do you need a parking spot?
It sends a message.
Just because I lured her away from her boyfriend and dumped her doesn't mean my scooter Sasha needs to suffer.
What are you doing?
Just making it official.
Chief.
Co-chief.
Try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.
That's Co-chief Resident Dorian over there.
Damn it!
You are quick.
Damn it, I got an appendectomy again?
Sweet!
I get the duwa... do-oh...
Duodenal jejunostomy.
What's wrong with you?
So I can't pronounce it.
Try and be a little more sensitive, OK?
New bra, Janice?
Cos it's working.
The only reason I'm getting all these great procedures is because nobody's died on me in three months.
Man, you never have to apologise for being on a hot streak.
I'm psyched for you, and I wouldn't take those procedures away if I could.
Sir, would you mind giving me the duodenal jejunostomy instead of the Todd?
Am I impressed by your moxie?
You betcha.
Am I going to reward it?
Not a chance.
This Todd thing is killing me.
Where's your lunch?
Thank you, Barry.
Hey!
That's for Barry, Jr.
What?
The little guy's in leg braces.
Hi.
I visited my safety deposit box today.
Guess what I found?
- My grandfather's Purple Heart?
- Please.
I sold that years ago to pay for these.
Our wedding rings.
- Holy cow.
- What do you think?
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life.
Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer.
So you're just going to fall asleep right after for the rest of my life?
So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox the rest of my life?
I'm not sure I want to watch you drink a beer while I'm holding the baby for the rest of my life.
Look, Attila, there's no way I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, got that?
Yeah, not listening.
Now that we're married again, we've got to make out new wills in case one of us dies.
Oh, God, I hope it's me.
Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.
Would Co-chief Dorian please report to the ICU?
Co-chief Dorian.
The co-chief.
Well, Mrs Covello, your CAT scan showed a small rectal tumour, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection.
Don't worry.
We have an amazing surgical team here, OK?
That means a lot, coming from the co-chief resident.
How did she hear?
She's been in a coma for two weeks!
- Damn it.
- Buddy.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down now,
- he's busy so it'd have to be me.
- What's he doing?
You know the surveyors outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
Gentlemen, say hello to June!
How about a sneak peek at July?
I don't know.
It's a little early to start pulling strings.
I just got this co-chief job.
Damn it, now I'm saying it.
Come on, man, get me back in the game.
- OK.
- OK!
OK!
Here's ten bucks for letting me help you out.
Spend it wisely.
I think she's a little upset she doesn't look the way she used to.
Why?
How did she used to look?
Oh, dear ugly.
What do you know?
It's the paging of the shrew.
Why don't you talk to her?
- Why don't you?
- Mind my own business.
Your life is your life, it's not my job to fix it, unless you ask me.
When I get in there, because I'm a good shrink, and you, my friend, are a walking disaster.
Shall we?
So now, Miss Myers, how are you feeling?
I was wondering if it were possible to have surgery again.
Hi, sweetie.
I'm in a tunnel.
Your body's been through an enormous amount of trauma.
I can't recommend you go racing back into surgery.
If you just give it time, you'll be happy with the way you look.
Oh, my God.
What?
I just don't look like myself.
I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes, but they were my nose and my droopy eyes, you know?
Tell me more about yourself.
Around here, there's always one person that'll come through for you.
In Turk's case, that was me.
Hey, Elliot!
I want to talk to you about this chief resident thing.
- What about it?
- Well, as you may have heard from the loud speaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother and a coma patient,
I'm being referred to as the co-chief resident.
I think we should either both go with co-chief or chief, don't you co-agree?
Excuse me, we're working up this patient for a hyper-coagulable state with a prolonged PTT.
What's our next step?
That's easy.
What you want to do...
I'd like my answer from the chief resident.
We're both chief residents.
Isn't that right, Dr Reid?
With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do a one-to-one mixing study.
That's why she's the chief, you're the co-chief.
- Shut up, Lonnie!
- You shut up!
Obviously, for your ex-wife, just the illusion of hair is important.
Excuse me.
So you're saying it had nothing to do with my impotence?
I was wondering if we could talk about Miss Myers in my office.
I make it a point to never enter a shrink's office unless I'm planning on over-paying somebody for telling me something I already know.
You're distracted by your marriage.
I know.
What do I owe?
Will 10 bucks cover it?
- Yeah!
- Are you gonna hang onto that?
I forgot my lunch money.
It's kielbasa day in the cafeteria.
Love it.
Miss Myers values your opinion.
I don't think you're trying to understand how she feels.
Look, if I ever want your advice on one of my patients,
I'll ask, but do not hold your breath, unless, of course, you can hold it for a really long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
I can't.
I used to smoke.
Kielbasa.
Yes!
Let me buy you lunch.
I'm rich.
I'll buy you lunch and some gold teeth to eat it with.
You got one more black joke this month before I bust your ass.
Damn it!
I used them all up watching Barbershop 9.
That's it, and I'll get you later.
- How'd surgery go?
- I was on top of my game.
It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend.
- It's huge when they come through.
- How's she doing?
Unfortunately, she didn't make it.
What?
- What do you mean she died?
- JD, I did everything I could.
My attending thought I did great.
He said, "Do I think you did great?
I do."
I couldn't help wonder if by taking that patient from Todd and giving her to Turk, I had toyed with fate.
I know that look.
You're wondering if you toyed with fate.
How could you know that?
It's a brand-new look!
What do you think Todd would have done that I didn't?
- Doctor, her heart stopped.
- No!
Here!
I'm gay!
I knew it.
Oh, my God!
That's your "the Todd would have pulled his own heart out" look!
OK, we have been spending way too much time together.
Guess what there, wifey.
You can't be a pain in the ass if I don't have a phone.
Hi, sweetie.
Save it.
I was calling to tell you
I'm taking Jack and staying at my mother's a few months.
Who's gonna look after him when you and your mother go marauding for flesh?
Thank you for making this so much easier.
Jordan...
Jordan.
Come on, Jordan!
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna go check on Miss Myers.
Molly sent her down to surgery.
Oh, wrong day, new chick!
In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life affect your professional life.
Forget about JD.
You're just as good as the Todd.
You got this.
All right, people, I believe we're done here.
Did you just sew your gown into the patient?
Yeah, you did.
Hey!
Hey, somebody!
Hey!
Randall was in the air conditioning vent and it collapsed on him.
Buddy!
Co-chief!
Co-chief!
Hey, you fixed him!
Come on, buddy.
That's it!
Dr Kelso, could you help me out?
People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.
You should take it up with the chief resident.
But I'm the chief resident!
Dr Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and mine's made out to the co-chief resident, but we both make the same amount.
Right.
Dr Reid, you should make $10 more a month, and Dr Dorian, you should be making $10 less.
It's not much, but it symbolises the difference in your levels.
- Coolio!
- Coolio indeed.
I could spend all day worrying about what happened, but I have more important things to do.
Hey, man, look what I confiscated from one of the kids in paediatrics.
- What, too hot?
- Yeah!
- Sorry.
- Not in the mood!
OK, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.
- Dream come true, right?
- Do you really think I want this suit?
Well, I do... but not from you!
Now I get it.
You're just mad cos I make more money than you.
No, I'm mad because of that surgery today.
You doubted me.
You are such a wuss!
Turk, come on!
These things chafe.
Now I know why Eddie called it Raw.
Carla, do you have any powder?
You went behind my back.
I gave you every opportunity to do the right thing.
I'll tell you what, Miss Manners, why don't you gulp down that bear-sized bite and then we'll talk.
Yummy.
That is great kielbasa, but you can't really screw up kielbasa, can you?
So, where were we?
Honest to God, I can't remember.
Right, Miss Myers.
The plastic surgeon said it was safe to operate, and Miss Myers really liked her old face.
You don't have to be a psychiatrist to see that if you used to be happy and now you're not, you should go back to the way it was when you were happy.
Isn't that what you would do?
Yeah.
Jordan.
Will you?
Will you divorce me?
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Thank God.
Listen, I probably should have put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
What?
I haven't even been thinking about it.
Look, JD, ever since you dumped me, everyone has been treating me like some kind of victim.
It's like, "Look at poor Elliot going home alone."
Or "Look at poor Elliot, riding a tandem bike by herself."
That's not something I normally do.
I wanted ice cream, my car was out of gas and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me.
- They do everything together.
- OK.
The point is, it was nice being the one chief resident for a while.
She's got fingers like biceps.
And so, by the power vested in me by the American Bar Association,
I pronounce you ex-husband and ex-wife.
You may now do whatever the hell you want!
- I've never been this happy.
- Me, neither.
You have no chance of being normal.
Thirsty, huh?
Helps the tears taste less bitter.
Cheers.
How are you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?
By not inviting you.
Oh, my God, dude, I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?
Maybe I needed you to believe in me.
I believe in you, baby.
Yeah, but we're married, that doesn't count.
- What the?
- Did you?
- Yeah.
She's been gravelled.
- Nice work.
Look, man, it was one second of doubt, OK?
Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?
I don't.
I care what you think.
Since the day I met you, you've treated me like I was the man, like I could accomplish everything.
- This is gonna sound lame...
- I got it!
You being like that is one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
Wow.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
In the end, every relationship needs maintenance.
Hey, Ted, get out the sun, man.
You owe me money!
Whether it's the smallest gesture...
Hey, doctor!
Doc!
You want to take a look at the guy in 302 and tell me whether you think he's sick or just bonkers.
Are you actually asking my opinion?
I'm gonna ignore it, but yeah, knock yourself out.
... orjust picking up back where you left off.
I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
You'll kick ass, man.
So, are you guys gonna go out tonight?
No, we're gonna stay in.
Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
- Are your giblets warm?
- Like a Christmas ham.
Same.
The bottom line is that if you care about someone, it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.
Wow.
Thanks, JD.
And she's just been gravelled.
"Today I walk in here not as a resident but as a chief. "
"Chief resident!
Chief resident Dorian!
Chiefy chiefy chief!"
What's that, your new, uh cool guy walk?
No, I have rocks in my shoe.
"Wow, that's a lot of rocks. "
"I gotta stop taking that short-cut through the quarry. "
"Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect. "
Chief resident in the house!
Everybody say hey-ay!
"Even though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed to that chair"
"because once again he was flying high on crystal meth,"
"his respect felt good. "
"Honestly, it's the reason I keep voting for him. "
Have a good day.
Try not to torture anyone so much that they take their own lives.
I'll try.
You know, you're not looking as processed and overly-medicated as usual.
That is so sweet!
Come here!
"It was the same old Dr. Cox and Jordan. "
"The weird thing was, there was something underneath it... they were happy. "
We have some very exciting news.
Don't tell me...
You and Sweaty Teddy here are gonna finally have that commitment ceremony you've been dreaming about?
Perry, even if I went that way...
and believe me, there were nights in the service when it didn't sound so far-fetched
Ted is hardly my type.
I beg to differ.
I've seen Enid.
- What?
- Nothing.
Dr. Cox, remember a few years back, you asked me to look over your divorce papers to make sure
"that slag would die a penniless whore"?
Sorry.
It's okay, "slag" is kind of his pet-name for me.
Anyway, I was also going through a divorce... she's with my brother now;
he's nine inches shorter than me but he wears a piece...
The point is, you and I signed the wrong papers, which technically means you two are still married and so am I.
Well, mazel tovs all around!
"I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before. "
"It was neat-o!"
Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches?
Soo... from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.
Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?
No.
I had to do it anyway.
What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?
Thanks, bro.
Any other questions?
Smart guy?
What's up, ladies.
What's up with these rocks!
?
HAH!
You've been graveled!
"Graveled"?
It's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.
I like it.
Better than Play-Doh Pants?
Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
Wise!
"It felt good cheering Turk up. "
"See, now that I'm chief studly,"
"I was making a lot more money than him. "
"Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive. "
Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?
Here's five bucks for remembering.
Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!
You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?
- You know it, dawg!
- That's cold!
Look, I gotta go.
I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late.
- Plus he's a question-talker.
- What's a question-talker?
Do I want you to be on time, Dr. Turk?
Yes I do.
Am I going to remember this?
Of course I am.
Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages removed now.
Who do you mean, dashboard-face?
Yeah, I think she prefers "Miss Myers. "
Well then she probably shouldn't be checking her e-mail while she's driving ninety miles an hour.
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- We weren't waiting for you.
Great!
I'm on time!
See, I think as a psychiatrist that I should be there when Miss Myers' bandages get removed, because her accident was traumatic enough.
But with reconstructive facial surgery on top of that?
In my professional opinion:
Yikes!
Honey, if you are coming in,
I just might go ahead and phone up my pool-man and my architect so we can populate the room with just as many useless people as possible.
Great!
My mom's in town, should I call her?
That was good.
Okay, Miss Myers, I'm gonna go ahead and get these bandages off and make sure the plastic surgeons have left your face just as beautiful as it always was.
Oh, you're so nice.
Are you married?
Oh!
He is as of this morning!
- Really?
I thought he was divorced?
- No, child, the papers didn't go through!
You know what?
I've got a son, I don't fantasize about Jordan dying as much anymore, and, even though it wasn't planned,
I'm actually pretty happy about the way this whole marriage thing has worked out.
Sooo, would you please stop your chirping and step away from my personal life?
- So what's his wife like?
- So scary!
You go ahead and have a look there.
You look fantastic, you do.
Doctor?
Really fantastic.
Thank God you were here!
"Since Elliot and I are both chief residents,"
"I'm trying not to make it all about me. "
John Dorian, Chief Resident.
"You know, unless there's someone I could doink. "
Hey, uh, you need to move your car...
it's my day to have the parking spot.
J.D., you have a scooter!
Why do you even need a parking spot?
Mmmm, it sends a message.
"Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend"
"and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer. "
What are you doing?
Just making it official.
Chief.
Co-Chief.
You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.
And that's Co-Chief Resident Dorian over there!
Dammit!
You are quick!
Dammit, I got an appendectomy again?
Sweet!
I get the duah... d...
duoh... duo... duooh...
Duodenojejunostomy, man.
What's wrong with you?
So I can't pronounce it.
Try and be a little more sensitive, okay?
New bra, Janice?
'Cause it's working!
Besides, the only reason I'm getting all these great procedures is because nobody's died on me in like three months!
Listen, man, you never have to apologize for being on a hot-streak.
I'm psyched for you!
And I wouldn't take those procedures away even if I could.
Sir, would you mind giving me the duodenojejunostomy instead of the Todd?
Am I impressed by your moxie?
You bet'cha.
Am I going to reward it?
Not a chance.
This Todd thing is killing me.
Where's your lunch?
Thank you, Barry!
Hey!
That's for Barry Jr.!
What?
The little guy's in leg braces.
I visited my safety deposit box today.
Guess what I found?
My grandfather's purple heart!
Please, I sold that years ago to pay for these.
Our wedding rings.
- Holy cow!
- What do you think?
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life!
"Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer. "
So you're just going to, uh, fall asleep right after for the rest of my life?
So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox the rest of my life?
I'm not sure I want to watch you drink a beer while I'm holding the baby for the rest of my life!
Look, Attila... there's no way in hell that I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, you got that?
Yeah, not listening.
By the way, now that we're married again, we've gotta make out new wills in case one of us dies.
Oh, God, I hope it's me.
"Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise. "
Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.?
Co-Chief Dorian?
Co-Chief?
Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection.
But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?
That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!
"How did she hear?
She's been in a coma for two weeks!"
Dammit!
- Hey, buddy!
Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.
What's the Todd doing?
Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
Gentlemen!
Say hello to June!
How about a sneak-peek of July!
I don't know, Turk.
It's a little early for me to start pulling strings...
I just got this co-chief job.
Dammit, now I'm saying it!
Come on, man, get me back in the game!
You know what, here's ten bucks for letting me help you out.
Spend it wisely!
I think she's a little upset she doesn't look the way she used to.
Why?
How did she used to look?
Oh, dear ugly.
Oh, whatta you know, the paging of the shrew.
Look, why don't you just talk to her.
- Why don't you just...
- Mind my own business.
I know, your life is your life, and it's not my job to fix it, unless of course you ask me to.
And, man, would I get in there, 'cause I'm a good shrink and you my friend, are a walking disaster.
Shall we?
So, now, Miss Myers, um, how are you feeling?
I was wondering... if it were possible to have surgery again?
Hi, sweetie, I'm in a tunnel.
Look, your body's been through an enormous amount of trauma,
I can't recommend you go racing back in to surgery.
Now, I guarantee you, if you just give it time you'll be happy with the way you look.
Oh, my God.
WHAT!
?
I just don't look like myself.
I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes, but they were "my" nose and "my" droopy eyes, you know?
Tell me more about yourself.
"Around here, there's always at least one person that'll come through for you. "
"In Turk's case, that was me. "
Hey, Elliot!
Hey, I want to talk to you about this whole chief resident thing.
What about it?
Well, as you may have heard from the loudspeaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother, and a... a coma patient, um, I'm being referred to as the "co-" chief resident.
I think we should either both go with "co-chief" or "chief. "
Don't you... co-agree?
Excuse me.
We're working up this patient for a hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT?
What's our next step?
Well, that's easy, Lonnie, what you want to do...
I'd like my answer from the "chief" resident.
We're both chief residents.
Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?
With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do a one-to-one mixing study.
That's why she's the chief.
- You're the co-chief.
- Shut up, Lonnie!
You shut up!
Obviously for your ex-wife, just the illusion of hair is important.
Excuse me.
So you're saying it had nothing to do with my impotence?
Dr. Cox, I was wondering if we could talk about Miss Myers in my office?
Yeah, I make it a point to never enter a shrink's office unless I'm planning on grossly overpaying somebody for telling me something that I already know.
Look, you're obviously really distracted by the situation with your marriage...
Something I already know, what do I owe?
Will ten bucks cover it?
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, you're gonna hang onto that?
Yeah, you know, I forgot my lunch money, and it's kielbasa day in the cafeteria.
Kielbasa!
Love it.
Anyway, Miss Myers really values your opinion, but I don't think you're even trying to understand how she feels.
Look, if I ever want your advice on one of my patients, I'll ask.
But do not hold your breath, unless of course you can hold it for a really long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
I can't, I used to smoke.
Kielbasa.
Yes!
- Let me buy you lunch.
- I'm rich.
I'll buy you lunch and some gold teeth to eat it with!
You know, you only got one more black joke this month before I bust your ass.
Dammit!
I used 'em all up watching 'Barber Shop 9'.
Okay, that's it, and I'll get you later.
How'd surgery go?
Oh, you know, I was on top of my game.
"It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend. "
"That's why it's a huge relief when they come through. "
How's she doing?
Unfortunately she didn't make it.
"What?"
- What do you mean she died?
- I did everything I could.
Even my attending thought I did great.
He said, "Do I think you did great?
Yes I do!"
"I couldn't help wonder if by taking that patient from Todd"
"and giving her to Turk, I had toyed with fate. "
I know that look.
You're wondering if you toyed with fate!
How could you know that look?
It's a brand new look!
What do you think Todd would've done that I didn't?
Doctor, her heart stopped.
No!
Here!
I'm gay!
I knew it.
Oh my God!
That's your "the Todd would've pulled his own heart out" look!
Okay, we have been spending way too much time together.
Guess what there, wifey.
You can't be a pain in the ass if I don't have a phone.
Oh, ohh!
Hi, sweetie!
Save it.
I was just calling to tell you that I'm taking Jack and staying at my mother's for a few months.
But who's going to be looking after him when you and your mother go out marauding for flesh?
Thank you for making this so much easier, Perry.
Jordan.
Jordan, come on, Jordan.
Ahhh.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna go check on Miss Myers.
Molly sent her down to surgery.
Oh-ho-ho, wrong day, new chick!
"In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life
"affect your professional life. "
"Forget about J.D."
"You're just as good as the Todd.
You got this. "
All right, people!
I believe we're done here.
Did you just sew your gown into the patient?
Yeah, ya did.
Hey!
Hey, someone!
Hey!
Randall was in the air conditioning vent, and it collapsed on him!
Buddy!
Co-chief.
Co-chief!
Hey, you fixed him!
Come on, buddy!
"That's it!"
Dr. Kelso, could you help me out?
People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.
Well, it sounds like something you should take up with the chief resident.
But, "I'm" the chief resident.
Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and-and mine's made out to the co-chief resident.
But we both make the same amount.
You're right.
Dr. Reid, you should be making ten dollars more a month, and of course, Dr. Dorian, you should be making ten dollars less.
I know it's not much, but it's largely to symbolize the difference in your levels.
- Coolio!
- Coolio, indeed.
"I could spend all day worrying about what just happened,"
"but I have more important things to do. "
Hey, man.
Look what I confiscated from one of the kids in Pediatrics.
What, too hot?
...
Sorry.
Not in the mood!
Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.
Ahhh?
Dream come true, right!
Do you really think I want this suit?
Well, I do.
But not from you!
Oh, now I get it.
You're just mad because I make more money than you.
No, I'm mad because of that surgery today.
You doubted me.
You are such a wuss!
Turk, come on.
Ah, these things chafe.
Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw".
Carla!
Do you have any powder?
You.
You went behind my back.
I gave you every opportunity to do the right thing.
I'll tell you what, there, Miss Manners:
Why don't you go ahead and gulp down that bear-sized bite, and then we'll talk.
Yummy!
Man, that is great kielbasa.
But you can't really screw up kielbasa, can you?
So, um, where were we?
Honest to God, I can't remember.
Oh, right, Miss Myers.
The plastic surgeon said it was safe to operate, and Miss Myers really liked her old face.
And you don't have to be a psychiatrist to see, Perry, that if you used to be truly happy and now you're not, then you should go back to the way it was when you were happy.
Isn't that what you would do?
Yeah...
Jordan!
Will you... will you divorce me?
Ohh, I thought you'd never ask!
Listen, I probably shoulda put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
What co-chief stuff?
I haven't even been thinking about it.
Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me, everyone around here's been treating me like some kind of a victim.
It's like, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot going home alone. "
Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding a tandem bike by herself. "
That's not something I normally do,
I just really wanted ice cream the other night, my car was out of gas, and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me.
They do everything together...
Okay...
The point is it was nice being the one chief resident for a while, you know?
She's got fingers like biceps!
And so, by the power vested in me by the American Bar Association,
I pronounce you ex-husband and ex-wife.
You may now do whatever the hell you want!
- I've never been this happy.
- Me neither.
You have no chance of being normal.
Thirsty, huh?
Helps the tears taste less bitter.
Cheers.
So!
How you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?
By not inviting you!
Oh my God!
Dude!
I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?
Maybe I needed you to believe in me!
I believe in you, baby.
Yeah, but we're married...
that doesn't count.
What the?
Ow, ow, ow, what?
- Did you, uh...?
- Yeah, she's been graveled.
Nice work.
Look, man, it was one second of doubt, okay?
Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?
I don't.
I care what you think.
Since the day I met you, you've treated me like I was the man, like I could accomplish everything.
- This is gonna sound lame, but...
- I've got it!
your being like that's one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
"In the end, every relationship needs maintenance. "
Hey, Ted.
Get out the sun, man.
You owe me money!
"Whether it's the smallest gesture... "
Hey, Doctor.
Doctor!
Want to, uh, you wanna take a look at the guy in 302 and tell me whether or not you think he's really sick or just bonkers?
Are you actually asking my opinion?
Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...
yeah, knock yourself out.
"Or just picking up back where you left off. "
I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
Aw, you'll kick ass.
So are you guys gonna go out tonight?
No, we're gonna stay in.
Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
- Are your giblets warm?
- Like a Christmas ham!
Same!
"The bottom line is that if you care about someone,"
"it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice. "
Thanks, J.D.
And she's just been graveled!
Today I walk in here not as a resident, but as chief.
Chief resident.
Chief Resident Dorian.
Chiefy-chiefy-chief.
What's that, your new cool guy walk?
No.
I have rocks in my shoe.
Wow!
That's a lot of rocks!
I gotta stop taking that shortcut through the quarry.
Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect.
Chief resident in the house.
- Everybody say, "Hey!"
- Hey!
Though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed because he was flying high on crystal meth, his respect felt good.
It's the reason I keep voting for him.
Have a good day.
Try not to torture anyone so much
- that they take their own lives.
- I'll try.
You're not looking as processed and overly-medicated as usual.
- That is so sweet.
- Come here.
It was the same old Dr Cox and Jordan.
The weird thing was, there was something underneath it.
They were happy.
We have some very exciting news.
Don't tell me.
You and Sweaty Teddy here are gonna finally have that commitment ceremony?
Even if I went that way, and there were nights in the service when it didn't sound far-fetched,
- Ted is hardly my type.
- I beg to differ.
I've seen Enid.
- What?
- Nothing.
Dr Cox, remember a few years back, you asked me to look over your divorce papers to make sure "that slag would die a penniless whore"?
Sorry.
It's OK. "Slag" is kind of his pet name for me.
Anyway, I was also going through a divorce.
She's with my brother now.
He's nine inches shorter than me, but he wears a piece.
The point is, you and I signed the wrong papers, which technically means you two are still married and so am I.
Well, mazeltovs all around.
I'd never seen Dr Cox and Jordan speechless before.
It was neato.
Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches.
So from now on, I'm gonna be your britches-shrinker.
Is that supposed to intimidate me?
No.
I had to do it anyway.
What reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?
Thanks, bro.
Any other questions, smart guy?
Whassup, ladies?
What's up with these rocks?
- You've been gravelled!
- Gravelled?
It's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.
- I like it.
- Better than Play-Doh Pants?
Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
Wise.
It felt good cheering Turk up.
Now I'm Chief Studly, I was making a lot more money than him.
Needless to say, it was a time to be extra sensitive.
Remember I make more money than you?
Here's five bucks for remembering.
I was thinking about spending some extra ducats on one of those classy suits we wanted.
The leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in Raw?
- You know it.
- That's cold.
I gotta go.
I got a new attending and he hates it when we're late.
- Plus, he's a question talker.
- What's a question talker?
Do I want you to be on time, Dr Turk?
Yes, I do.
Am I going to remember this?
Of course I am.
Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages removed now.
You mean "dashboard face"?
Yeah, I think she prefers Miss Myers.
She shouldn't be checking her e-mail while driving 90 mph.
- Sorry I'm late.
- We weren't waiting for you.
Great, I'm on time.
As a psychiatrist I should be there when Miss Myers' bandages get removed,
Her accident was traumatic enough, but with reconstructive facial surgery on top of that?
In my professional opinion, "Yikes!"
If you are coming in, I just might go ahead and phone up my pool man and my architect so we can populate the room with useless people.
Great!
My mom's in town.
Should I call her?
That was good.
OK, I'm gonna get these bandages off and make sure the plastic surgeons have left your face as beautiful as it always was.
You're so nice.
Are you married?
He is as of this morning.
I thought he was divorced.
No, the papers didn't go through.
You know what?
I've got a son,
I don't fantasise about Jordan dying as much anymore, and even though it wasn't planned, I'm actually happy about the way this marriage thing has worked out, so please stop your chirping and step away from my personal life.
- So, what's his wife like?
- So scary.
You go ahead and have a look there.
Wow.
You look fantastic.
You do.
Doctor?
Really fantastic.
Thank God you were here.
Since Elliot and I are both chief residents,
I'm trying not to make it all about me.
John Dorian, chief resident.
You know, unless it's someone I could doink.
You need to move your car.
It's my day to have the parking spot.
You have a scooter.
Why do you need a parking spot?
It sends a message.
Just because I lured her away from her boyfriend and dumped her doesn't mean my scooter Sasha needs to suffer.
What are you doing?
Just making it official.
Chief.
Co-chief.
Try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.
That's Co-chief Resident Dorian over there.
Damn it!
You are quick.
Damn it, I got an appendectomy again?
Sweet!
I get the duwa... do-oh...
Duodenal jejunostomy.
What's wrong with you?
So I can't pronounce it.
Try and be a little more sensitive, OK?
New bra, Janice?
Cos it's working.
The only reason I'm getting all these great procedures is because nobody's died on me in three months.
Man, you never have to apologise for being on a hot streak.
I'm psyched for you, and I wouldn't take those procedures away if I could.
Sir, would you mind giving me the duodenal jejunostomy instead of the Todd?
Am I impressed by your moxie?
You betcha.
Am I going to reward it?
Not a chance.
This Todd thing is killing me.
Where's your lunch?
Thank you, Barry.
Hey!
That's for Barry, Jr.
What?
The little guy's in leg braces.
Hi.
I visited my safety deposit box today.
Guess what I found?
- My grandfather's Purple Heart?
- Please.
I sold that years ago to pay for these.
Our wedding rings.
- Holy cow.
- What do you think?
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life.
Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer.
So you're just going to fall asleep right after for the rest of my life?
So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox the rest of my life?
I'm not sure I want to watch you drink a beer while I'm holding the baby for the rest of my life.
Look, Attila, there's no way I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, got that?
Yeah, not listening.
Now that we're married again, we've got to make out new wills in case one of us dies.
Oh, God, I hope it's me.
Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise.
Would Co-chief Dorian please report to the ICU?
Co-chief Dorian.
The co-chief.
Well, Mrs Covello, your CAT scan showed a small rectal tumour, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection.
Don't worry.
We have an amazing surgical team here, OK?
That means a lot, coming from the co-chief resident.
How did she hear?
She's been in a coma for two weeks!
- Damn it.
- Buddy.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down now,
- he's busy so it'd have to be me.
- What's he doing?
You know the surveyors outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
Gentlemen, say hello to June!
How about a sneak peek at July?
I don't know.
It's a little early to start pulling strings.
I just got this co-chief job.
Damn it, now I'm saying it.
Come on, man, get me back in the game.
- OK.
- OK!
OK!
Here's ten bucks for letting me help you out.
Spend it wisely.
I think she's a little upset she doesn't look the way she used to.
Why?
How did she used to look?
Oh, dear ugly.
What do you know?
It's the paging of the shrew.
Why don't you talk to her?
- Why don't you?
- Mind my own business.
Your life is your life, it's not my job to fix it, unless you ask me.
When I get in there, because I'm a good shrink, and you, my friend, are a walking disaster.
Shall we?
So now, Miss Myers, how are you feeling?
I was wondering if it were possible to have surgery again.
Hi, sweetie.
I'm in a tunnel.
Your body's been through an enormous amount of trauma.
I can't recommend you go racing back into surgery.
If you just give it time, you'll be happy with the way you look.
Oh, my God.
What?
I just don't look like myself.
I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes, but they were my nose and my droopy eyes, you know?
Tell me more about yourself.
Around here, there's always one person that'll come through for you.
In Turk's case, that was me.
Hey, Elliot!
I want to talk to you about this chief resident thing.
- What about it?
- Well, as you may have heard from the loud speaker, some residents, the janitor, my mother, your mother and a coma patient,
I'm being referred to as the co-chief resident.
I think we should either both go with co-chief or chief, don't you co-agree?
Excuse me, we're working up this patient for a hyper-coagulable state with a prolonged PTT.
What's our next step?
That's easy.
What you want to do...
I'd like my answer from the chief resident.
We're both chief residents.
Isn't that right, Dr Reid?
With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do a one-to-one mixing study.
That's why she's the chief, you're the co-chief.
- Shut up, Lonnie!
- You shut up!
Obviously, for your ex-wife, just the illusion of hair is important.
Excuse me.
So you're saying it had nothing to do with my impotence?
I was wondering if we could talk about Miss Myers in my office.
I make it a point to never enter a shrink's office unless I'm planning on over-paying somebody for telling me something I already know.
You're distracted by your marriage.
I know.
What do I owe?
Will 10 bucks cover it?
- Yeah!
- Are you gonna hang onto that?
I forgot my lunch money.
It's kielbasa day in the cafeteria.
Love it.
Miss Myers values your opinion.
I don't think you're trying to understand how she feels.
Look, if I ever want your advice on one of my patients,
I'll ask, but do not hold your breath, unless, of course, you can hold it for a really long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
I can't.
I used to smoke.
Kielbasa.
Yes!
Let me buy you lunch.
I'm rich.
I'll buy you lunch and some gold teeth to eat it with.
You got one more black joke this month before I bust your ass.
Damn it!
I used them all up watching Barbershop 9.
That's it, and I'll get you later.
- How'd surgery go?
- I was on top of my game.
It can be scary to stick your neck out for a friend.
- It's huge when they come through.
- How's she doing?
Unfortunately, she didn't make it.
What?
- What do you mean she died?
- JD, I did everything I could.
My attending thought I did great.
He said, "Do I think you did great?
I do."
I couldn't help wonder if by taking that patient from Todd and giving her to Turk, I had toyed with fate.
I know that look.
You're wondering if you toyed with fate.
How could you know that?
It's a brand-new look!
What do you think Todd would have done that I didn't?
- Doctor, her heart stopped.
- No!
Here!
I'm gay!
I knew it.
Oh, my God!
That's your "the Todd would have pulled his own heart out" look!
OK, we have been spending way too much time together.
Guess what there, wifey.
You can't be a pain in the ass if I don't have a phone.
Hi, sweetie.
Save it.
I was calling to tell you
I'm taking Jack and staying at my mother's a few months.
Who's gonna look after him when you and your mother go marauding for flesh?
Thank you for making this so much easier.
Jordan...
Jordan.
Come on, Jordan!
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna go check on Miss Myers.
Molly sent her down to surgery.
Oh, wrong day, new chick!
In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life affect your professional life.
Forget about JD.
You're just as good as the Todd.
You got this.
All right, people, I believe we're done here.
Did you just sew your gown into the patient?
Yeah, you did.
Hey!
Hey, somebody!
Hey!
Randall was in the air conditioning vent and it collapsed on him.
Buddy!
Co-chief!
Co-chief!
Hey, you fixed him!
Come on, buddy.
That's it!
Dr Kelso, could you help me out?
People have been referring to me as the co-chief resident.
You should take it up with the chief resident.
But I'm the chief resident!
Dr Reid's check is made out to the chief resident, and mine's made out to the co-chief resident, but we both make the same amount.
Right.
Dr Reid, you should make $10 more a month, and Dr Dorian, you should be making $10 less.
It's not much, but it symbolises the difference in your levels.
- Coolio!
- Coolio indeed.
I could spend all day worrying about what happened, but I have more important things to do.
Hey, man, look what I confiscated from one of the kids in paediatrics.
- What, too hot?
- Yeah!
- Sorry.
- Not in the mood!
OK, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.
- Dream come true, right?
- Do you really think I want this suit?
Well, I do... but not from you!
Now I get it.
You're just mad cos I make more money than you.
No, I'm mad because of that surgery today.
You doubted me.
You are such a wuss!
Turk, come on!
These things chafe.
Now I know why Eddie called it Raw.
Carla, do you have any powder?
You went behind my back.
I gave you every opportunity to do the right thing.
I'll tell you what, Miss Manners, why don't you gulp down that bear-sized bite and then we'll talk.
Yummy.
That is great kielbasa, but you can't really screw up kielbasa, can you?
So, where were we?
Honest to God, I can't remember.
Right, Miss Myers.
The plastic surgeon said it was safe to operate, and Miss Myers really liked her old face.
You don't have to be a psychiatrist to see that if you used to be happy and now you're not, you should go back to the way it was when you were happy.
Isn't that what you would do?
Yeah.
Jordan.
Will you?
Will you divorce me?
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Thank God.
Listen, I probably should have put a stop to all this co-chief stuff.
What?
I haven't even been thinking about it.
Look, JD, ever since you dumped me, everyone has been treating me like some kind of victim.
It's like, "Look at poor Elliot going home alone."
Or "Look at poor Elliot, riding a tandem bike by herself."
That's not something I normally do.
I wanted ice cream, my car was out of gas and that's the bike the Gundersons loaned me.
- They do everything together.
- OK.
The point is, it was nice being the one chief resident for a while.
She's got fingers like biceps.
And so, by the power vested in me by the American Bar Association,
I pronounce you ex-husband and ex-wife.
You may now do whatever the hell you want!
- I've never been this happy.
- Me, neither.
You have no chance of being normal.
Thirsty, huh?
Helps the tears taste less bitter.
Cheers.
How are you guys gonna celebrate your divorce?
By not inviting you.
Oh, my God, dude, I doubted you for a second, why are you so mad?
Maybe I needed you to believe in me.
I believe in you, baby.
Yeah, but we're married, that doesn't count.
- What the?
- Did you?
- Yeah.
She's been gravelled.
- Nice work.
Look, man, it was one second of doubt, OK?
Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?
I don't.
I care what you think.
Since the day I met you, you've treated me like I was the man, like I could accomplish everything.
- This is gonna sound lame...
- I got it!
You being like that is one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
Wow.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
In the end, every relationship needs maintenance.
Hey, Ted, get out the sun, man.
You owe me money!
Whether it's the smallest gesture...
Hey, doctor!
Doc!
You want to take a look at the guy in 302 and tell me whether you think he's sick or just bonkers.
Are you actually asking my opinion?
I'm gonna ignore it, but yeah, knock yourself out.
... orjust picking up back where you left off.
I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
You'll kick ass, man.
So, are you guys gonna go out tonight?
No, we're gonna stay in.
Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
- Are your giblets warm?
- Like a Christmas ham.
Same.
The bottom line is that if you care about someone, it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice.
Wow.
Thanks, JD.
And she's just been gravelled.
"Today I walk in here not as a resident but as a chief."
"Chief resident!
Chief resident Dorian!
Chiefy chiefy chief!"
What's that, your new, uh cool guy walk?
No, I have rocks in my shoe.
"Wow, that's a lot of rocks."
"I gotta stop taking that short-cut through the quarry."
"Anyway, the best thing about my new job is that I command a lot more respect."
Chief resident in the house!
Everybody say hey-ay!
"Even though Councilman Donovan was handcuffed to that chair"
"because once again he was flying high on crystal meth,"
"his respect felt good."
"Honestly, it's the reason I keep voting for him."
Have a good day.
Try not to torture anyone so much that they take their own lives.
I'll try.
You know, you're not looking as processed and overly-medicated as usual.
That is so sweet!
Come here!
"It was the same old Dr. Cox and Jordan."
"The weird thing was, there was something underneath it... they were happy."
We have some very exciting news.
Don't tell me...
You and Sweaty Teddy here are gonna finally have that commitment ceremony you've been dreaming about?
Perry, even if I went that way...
and believe me, there were nights in the service when it didn't sound so far-fetched
Ted is hardly my type.
I beg to differ.
I've seen Enid.
- What?
- Nothing.
Dr. Cox, remember a few years back, you asked me to look over your divorce papers to make sure
"that slag would die a penniless whore"?
Sorry.
It's okay, "slag" is kind of his pet-name for me.
Anyway, I was also going through a divorce... she's with my brother now;
he's nine inches shorter than me but he wears a piece...
The point is, you and I signed the wrong papers, which technically means you two are still married and so am I.
Well, mazel tovs all around !
"I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan speechless before."
"It was neat-o!"
Just so you know, I think this chief resident thing has made you a little too big for your britches ?
Soo...from now on I'm gonna be your britches shrinker.
Oh, what, is that supposed to intimidate me or something?
No.
I had to do it anyway.
What possible reason could you have for breaking your broom in half?
Thanks, bro.
Any other questions?
Smart guy?
What's up, ladies.
What's up with these rocks!
?
HAH!
You've been graveled!
"Graveled"?
It's a new game I made up this morning when I had rocks in my shoes.
I like it.
Better than Play-Doh Pants?
Play-Doh Pants became all about the money.
Wise !
"It felt good cheering Turk up."
"See, now that I'm chief studly,"
"I was making a lot more money than him."
"Needless to say it was a time to be extra sensitive."
Hey, you remember how I make more money than you now?
Here's five bucks for remembering.
Anyway, I was thinking about spending some of my extra ducats on one of those classy suits we always wanted!
You mean the leather purple jumpsuit Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?
- You know it, dawg!
- That's cold!
Look, I gotta go.
I've got a new attending and he hates it when we're late.
- Plus he's a question-talker.
- What's a question-talker?
Do I want you to be on time, Dr. Turk?
Yes I do.
Am I going to remember this ?
Of course I am.
Miss Myers is ready to have her bandages removed now.
Who do you mean, dashboard-face?
Yeah, I think she prefers "Miss Myers."
Well then she probably shouldn't be checking her e-mail while she's driving ninety miles an hour.
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- We weren't waiting for you.
Great !
I'm on time !
See, I think as a psychiatrist that I should be there when Miss Myers' bandages get removed, because her accident was traumatic enough.
But with reconstructive facial surgery on top of that?
In my professional opinion:
Yikes!
Honey, if you are coming in,
I just might go ahead and phone up my pool-man and my architect so we can populate the room with just as many useless people as possible.
Great!
My mom's in town, should I call her?
That was good.
Okay, Miss Myers, I'm gonna go ahead and get these bandages off and make sure the plastic surgeons have left your face just as beautiful as it always was.
Oh, you're so nice.
Are you married ?
Oh!
He is as of this morning!
- Really ?
I thought he was divorced ?
- No, child, the papers didn't go through !
You know what?
I've got a son, I don't fantasize about Jordan dying as much anymore, and, even though it wasn't planned,
I'm actually pretty happy about the way this whole marriage thing has worked out.
Sooo, would you please stop your chirping and step away from my personal life?
- So what's his wife like ?
- So scary !
You go ahead and have a look there.
You look fantastic, you do.
Doctor ?
Really fantastic.
Thank God you were here!
"Since Elliot and I are both chief residents,"
"I'm trying not to make it all about me."
John Dorian, Chief Resident.
"You know, unless there's someone I could doink."
Hey, uh, you need to move your car...
it's my day to have the parking spot.
J.D., you have a scooter!
Why do you even need a parking spot?
Mmmm, it sends a message.
"Just because I lured her away from her perfect boyfriend"
"and then dumped her doesn't mean my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer."
What are you doing?
Just making it official.
Chief.
Co-Chief.
You can try as hard as you want, that is never gonna stick.
And that's Co-Chief Resident Dorian over there!
Dammit!
You are quick!
Dammit, I got an appendectomy again ?
Sweet !
I get the duah...d...
duoh...duo...duooh...
Duodenojejunostomy, man.
What's wrong with you?
So I can't pronounce it.
Try and be a little more sensitive, okay?
New bra, Janice?
'Cause it's working!
Besides, the only reason I'm getting all these great procedures is because nobody's died on me in like three months!
Listen, man, you never have to apologize for being on a hot-streak.
I'm psyched for you!
And I wouldn't take those procedures away even if I could.
Sir, would you mind giving me the duodenojejunostomy instead of the Todd?
Am I impressed by your moxie ?
You bet'cha.
Am I going to reward it ?
Not a chance.
This Todd thing is killing me.
Where's your lunch?
Thank you, Barry!
Hey!
That's for Barry Jr.!
What?
The little guy's in leg braces.
I visited my safety deposit box today.
Guess what I found?
My grandfather's purple heart!
Please, I sold that years ago to pay for these.
Our wedding rings.
- Holy cow!
- What do you think?
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life!
"Of course, marriage can make the rest of your life seem longer."
So you're just going to, uh, fall asleep right after for the rest of my life?
So I'm supposed to pay for your Botox the rest of my life?
I'm not sure I want to watch you drink a beer while I'm holding the baby for the rest of my life!
Look, Attila... there's no way in hell that I'm gonna listen to you complain about the rest of your life for the rest of my life, you got that?
Yeah, not listening.
By the way, now that we're married again, we've gotta make out new wills in case one of us dies.
Oh, God, I hope it's me.
"Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise."
Would Co-Chief Dorian please report to the I.C.U.?
Co-Chief Dorian?
Co-Chief?
Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan showed a small rectal tumor, so I want to schedule a low anterior resection.
But don't worry, we have an amazing surgical team here, okay?
That means a lot coming from the co-chief resident!
"How did she hear?
She's been in a coma for two weeks!"
Dammit !
- Hey, buddy!
Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I know the Todd's doing her resection, but if you send her down right now, he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.
What's the Todd doing?
Yeah, well, you know the city surveyor is outside taking pictures of the hospital for the zoning commission?
I told him they were shooting a Sacred Heart calendar.
Gentlemen!
Say hello to June!
How about a sneak-peek of July!
I don't know, Turk.
It's a little early for me to start pulling strings...
I just got this co-chief job.
Dammit, now I'm saying it!
Come on, man, get me back in the game!
You know what, here's ten bucks for letting me help you out.
Spend it wisely!
I think she's a little upset she doesn't look the way she used to.
Why?
How did she used to look?
Oh, dear ugly.
Oh, whatta you know, the paging of the shrew.
Look, why don't you just talk to her.
- Why don't you just...
- Mind my own business.
I know, your life is your life, and it's not my job to fix it, unless of course you ask me to.
And, man, would I get in there, 'cause I'm a good shrink and you my friend, are a walking disaster.
Shall we?
So, now, Miss Myers, um, how are you feeling?
I was wondering...if it were possible to have surgery again?
Hi, sweetie, I'm in a tunnel.

Thank you for making this so much easier, Perry.
Jordan.
Jordan, come on, Jordan.
Ahhh.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna go check on Miss Myers.
Molly sent her down to surgery.
Oh-ho-ho, wrong day, new chick!
"In a hospital, it's hard not to let your personal life
"affect your professional life."
"Forget about J.D."
"You're just as good as the Todd.

"but I have more important things to do."

Sorry.
Not in the mood!
Okay, well, look, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.
Ahhh?
Dream come true, right!
Do you really think I want this suit?
Well, I do.
But not from you!
Oh, now I get it.
You're just mad because I make more money than you.
No, I'm mad because of that surgery today.
You doubted me.
You are such a wuss!
Turk, come on.
Ah, these things chafe.
Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw".
Carla!
Do you have any powder?
You.
You went behind my back.
I gave you every opportunity to do the right thing.
I'll tell you what, there, Miss Manners:
Why don't you go ahead and gulp down that bear-sized bite, and then we'll talk.
Yummy!
Man, that is great kielbasa.
But you can't really screw up kielbasa, can you?
So, um, where were we?
Honest to God, I can't remember.
Oh, right, Miss Myers.

What the?
Ow, ow, ow, what?
- Did you, uh...?
- Yeah, she's been graveled.
Nice work.
Look, man, it was one second of doubt, okay?
Since when do you care what anybody else thinks?
I don't.
I care what you think.
Since the day I met you, you've treated me like I was the man, like I could accomplish everything.

- I've got it!
your being like that's one of the reasons I've gotten to where I am.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
"In the end, every relationship needs maintenance."
Hey, Ted.
Get out the sun, man.
You owe me money!
"Whether it's the smallest gesture..."
Hey, Doctor.
Doctor!
Want to, uh, you wanna take a look at the guy in 302 and tell me whether or not you think he's really sick or just bonkers?
Are you actually asking my opinion?
Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...
yeah, knock yourself out.
"Or just picking up back where you left off."
I'm a little nervous about surgery tomorrow.
Aw, you'll kick ass.
So are you guys gonna go out tonight?
No, we're gonna stay in.
Well, I'll be in the bedroom with all the straight people.
- Are your giblets warm?
- Like a Christmas ham!
Same !
"The bottom line is that if you care about someone,"
"it's pretty easy to make the sacrifice."
Thanks, J.D.
And she's just been graveled!
- Whoa, honey.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.
Oh, goodness.
What's left to wear on your feet?
I know.
It's a sickness.
Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw.
But, actually, it came over on the Mayflower.
- What a wonderful history lesson.
- Any time.
Pasqualie's feeling unappreciated again.
We had "Stars Hollow Loves Pasqualie Day" last week.
Didn't stick.
Listen, I want to invite you to my anniversary party.
- Absolutely.
Which husband?
- No husband.
I'm talking about a lover... that's been much more loyal and seductive than a husband.
I'm talking about that business we call show.
- Forty years.
- No.
Forty years ago today, I did my first play, off-Broadway.
- Off-Broadway?
- Cleveland.
- That is off-Broadway.
- Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party... food, booze, a little song, a little dance, a little salsa down your pants.
- Well, count me and my pants in.
- Wonderful.
I will even drag Luke there.
So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.
- Luke won't come.
- Sure he will.
I have very effective methods of persuasion.
They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.
No, honey.
The party's on Tuesday.
The thirtieth.
- So?
- So the thirtieth is the dark day.
What dark day?
Luke's dark day.
The day that he disappears.
- Disappears?
Where?
- Nobody knows.
Nobody knows where he goes or what he does.
All we know is not to try and find him.
- Why didn't I know about this?
- I don't know, honey.
Everyone else does.
Anyhow, you come yourself, okay?
8:00.
I'll be there.
See you Tuesday, Patty.
Oh, Pasqualie, the maestro.
My God, you look virile today.
- Are you sure your wife won't share you?
- She's good.
- I don't agree.
- You're living in a fantasy world.
- I have classes all day long.
- I hear you protesting.
I've got a double major of poli-sci and bio-chem, Terrence.
- I see you over-scheduling.
- Sorry, I'm just getting water here.
Paris, you're not yelling at me.
You're yelling at the world.
I'm not yelling at all.
This is the natural register of my voice.
It's the register of a timid little girl who is not putting herself out there.
- I am putting myself out there.
- Why are you arguing with Terrence?
Why?
Look, I know I haven't dated lately, but Asher was very important to me.
Hey, Paris, I can't find my notebook.
The black one with all my yellow notes in it.
You have not put yourself out there.
He just died.
Oh, for God's sake.
He was halfway dead when you met him.
Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?
- Out where?
- Out in the world.
Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?
You don't just meet people.
It doesn't happen.
I'll just go in my room now.
Look at your Dream Log.
You are months behind.
And your Pretty-Thoughts Journal.
Okay, fine.
I have neglected thinking pretty.
But I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost...
- while you were in court-ordered rehab.
- Hey, Paris, what's this?
I had a back problem.
The prescription was at home in my Filofax.
This is a message from Headmaster Charleston.
- When did Headmaster Charleston call?
- Earlier.
- And you didn't tell me?
- I'm in session.
Hello, Headmaster Charleston, this is Rory Gilmore.
I'm sorry it took so long to call you back.
I just got your message.
Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive.
- We should talk later.
- So, how are you?
- I'm very well.
How are you enjoying Yale?
- I love it.
Is it everything you thought it would be?
It's nothing like I thought it would be.
It's better, actually.
I have no doubt.
Now, I'm calling... because we often ask a former Chilton student... to host a prospective Yale student for a couple of days.
Show them around, let them observe classes, campus life.
That sort of thing.
- I was wondering if you'd be interested.
- Me?
Yes, this is a very special young lady.
Bright, focused, quietly determined.
- She reminds me a great deal of you.
- Thank you.
I assume you haven't changed.
I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit, but I'm basically still me.
Excellent.
Then I hope you'll consider accepting.
I know your workload must be substantial.
- That's okay.
I can handle it.
- So, I can take that as a "Yes"?
Yes, take it as a "Yes," and thank you.
- I'm honored.
- Her name is Anna Fairchild.
She's 16 years old, and she'll be arriving...
Monday morning at 9:00.
Does that work for you?
- That works perfectly.
- Very well.
It's a date.
I'm very glad to talk to you again, Ms. Gilmore.
Yale certainly sounds like it's agreeing with you.
I hope it will also agree with Miss Fairchild.
- Like Sabrina.
- I beg your pardon?
- Sabrina Fairchild.
That was her name.
- Did we segue into discussing a movie?
- And we can segue right out again.
- I'm very grateful for that.
All right, then.
My office will be contacting you with the particulars.
I hope you have a wonderful time.
I'm sure Miss Fairchild will.
Thank you, Headmaster Charleston.
I won't let you down.
What a nice thing to hear.
I'm sure we'll be talking soon.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- This is a very big honor, you know.
- Oh, I know.
Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale, they're asking you?
I know.
I know.
Well, have you thought about... what kinds of things you'd like to show her?
Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course.
And I thought maybe she'd go to the paper with me... and then I thought, maybe a trip... to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.
Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.
- Steve?
- Bible.
- Right.
- Then I was torn between... taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle... or the science center and gymnasium.
That is a conundrum.
Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then.
You'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.
Lorelai, these things are of great interest... to any young person considering attending Yale.
Oh, I am sure.
I personally would enjoy every single thing on my list.
Yes, I know, but it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in.
I'm not talking a kegger... but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling...
"Give me a location. " or something like that.
- You know, your mother may be right.
- Who heard that?
Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience.
It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun, too.
- Have her touch the toe.
- Yeah.
- Touch the toe?
- The toe.
The statue of Theodore Woolsey.
It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet.
And for that reason, he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.
Wow, that is fun.
Make sure you get a parent-consent form for that one.
Oh, it is so exciting watching you at Yale.
It was such a wonderful time for me.
The people that you meet there... will stay with you for the rest of your life.
Mark my words.
- Tell me, are you making good friends?
- Yeah, I have some good friends.
- And what about Mr. Huntzberger?
- Who is Mr. Huntzberger?
Logan Huntzberger's a boy I go to school with.
- A fine boy, from a fine family.
- You know him?
His parents are very good friends of ours.
- You know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai.
- No.
He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.
No.
His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.
- No.
- Well, Logan is their son.
And I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night.
- The other night?
- He's very nice, Grandpa.
Now, I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.
Was this Logan at the male Yale party you guys threw?
He's the one who gave me a ride home, Mom.
Oh, Limo-boy.
Swell.
He's also on the paper with me.
His father owns some of the finest newspapers in the country.
- I know.
- Not a bad connection, huh?
Nope, not a bad connection at all.
- Hey, so tell me about this Logan.
- It's 3 degrees out here.
As of tonight, my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do.
That's not right or fair.
He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do.
For him, the dish is always half-empty.
You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?
What is the deal with this guy?
Are you dating?
No, we're not dating.
He's just a friend.
How close?
For example, if we freeze to death... will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?
I know him from school.
He's just a casual friend.
That's it.
- Do you think he's cute?
- It doesn't matter if I think he's cute.
It matters to me.
I don't want ugly grandchildren.
Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone.
Since Dean, I'm taking a boy break, okay?
I'm just concentrating on school.
- Fine, but if that changes...
- You'll be the first to know.
Okay, thank you. 'Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father.
Info on you, and looking better in chiffon, that's about it.
Oh, and my pole dance is way hotter.
- I'm frozen now.
- Okay, let's go.
In my hand, ladies and gentlemen... sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner.
I am never more than 10 feet away from pie.
See, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.
Oh, it's heaven.
One quick trip downstairs, and I have all the treats I want.
- You're like Willy Wonka but hotter.
- I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.
Slap on a purple top hat, and you're close.
This is nice.
I think it's going very well, you and me.
You think it's going very well?
I have very few complaints.
I'm going right past the "very few complaints" comment... 'cause I know you're just trying to bait me.
What complaints?
Hey, so, Luke...
Miss Patty is celebrating her 40-year anniversary.
- Which husband?
- With the business we call show.
Oh, him.
And she's having a big party, and I told her we'd go.
Oh, man.
- It'll be fun.
- It will not be fun.
She'll be wearing tap shoes, and there'll be songs and punch... and at least one story about Milton Berle's penis.
- Only one?
- Come on, I have to have you there.
Otherwise, people will think I made you up.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Thank you.
Okay, so, it's Tuesday at 8:00.
I can't go Tuesday.
- Why not?
- I have to go out of town.
- Why?
- Business.
Business?
Now you're Willy Loman?
Banking business in Woodbury.
Standing appointment.
Sorry.
Hit the light, will you?
I have to get up early.
Night.
Okay, night.
Wait till you see all the stuff I got for Anna.
Yale T-shirt, Bulldog sweatshirt, Yale baseball cap, visor, coffee mug.
I told you to open a window when you're hot-gluing in here.
It's freezing outside.
Oh, wait.
This is new.
They just came out with these.
- The Yale soda cozy.
How cute is that?
- I can't believe you.
You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore... and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know?
I'm trying to make her feel welcome.
Oh, she'll feel welcome.
They all feel welcome.
- Who's they?
- The enemy.
- What enemy?
- Any girl under the age of 17 is the enemy.
- Okay, I'm opening a window now.
- They're coming for everything.
They're going to take our jobs, our thunder, our starter husbands.
- Don't you have a class to get to?
- They're coming, Rory.
They're coming, and they're going to keep on coming... like the locusts descending on Mankato.
We'll be beating them off for the rest of our lives.
Please, don't be here when she arrives.
I don't want you to scare her off.
Me?
Scare her off?
Please.
She's the one with the alabaster skin and the perky breasts.
Do not say "perky breasts" to her.
- Do you understand me?
- Eve Harrington has arrived.
- Hi, I'm looking for Rory Gilmore.
- I'm Rory.
You must be Anna.
- Yes.
- Great, come in.
- Did you find it okay?
- I got lost a couple of times... but people were really nice and got me here.
Yeah, it's a friendly world out there, isn't it?
Anna, this is my roommate, Paris, and I'm sorry.
- For what?
- Trust me.
Okay.
Okay, let me show you around the place.
- That is Paris' room.
- Don't go in.
That is my room.
And this is the common room, which is also your bedroom.
- The bathroom is literally outside the door.
- Okay.
And there's a fridge with water or soda or whatever you want.
Oh, and I got you some welcome-to-Yale gifts.
Oh, really?
Thank you.
I'm really glad you're here.
You are going to love Yale.
It's an amazing place.
I mean, I was excited when I first started here... but every day is different and better.
You have no idea how much there is to learn.
It's...
- Well, you'll see.
- Okay, I actually snagged us some caviar.
They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos... and achieve a very similar result.
Hey.
- This is Anna.
- Did Paris move?
- I'm right here, Marty.
- I know, Paris.
Anna is from Chilton, my alma mater.
I'm showing her around Yale for a few days.
Oh, cool.
I'll put this in the fridge.
In my room.
- Thanks.
Okay, you ready?
- I'm ready.
- You have boys bringing you food.
- Yale is a magical place, Anna.
A magical, magical place.
The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the Old Campus... and it houses most of the undergraduate freshman class.
It was begun by Theodore Dwight Woolsey...
President of Yale from 1846 to 1871.
Over here is the Elihu Yale bench.
Now, Eli Yale was an officer in the British East India Company.
He gave what was then called the Collegiate School... £562 and 417 books and a portrait of King George I.
And so it was renamed in his honor.
He actually gave an additional £500 to the school... but Yale College never received it because he mistakenly sent it... to the nonexistent Collegiate School... apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him.
Wait, this is the wrong bench.
So keep the story, but cross out the diagram.
Moving on...
There's actually an ongoing rumor... that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree... if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.
Imagine all the tables you could wait with those skills, huh?
Okay, you are about to get a firsthand feel... of what it's like to work on a real newspaper.
Now be prepared.
It is an extremely hectic, fast-paced environment.
Don't get intimidated, and don't get in the way.
Ready?
Here it is.
Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something... but you just wait.
It can heat up in a second.
And when it does, man, watch out.
- My desk is over here.
- I do not care.
Hey, I am your editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me.
I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.
You will if you want to stay on this newspaper.
Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalistic dilemmas... between reporter and editor:
the right to withhold and protect sources.
Damn it, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now.
- The pen fairy.
- That is one of my personal... fine-point gel-tip pens from my bottom right-hand drawer... and you went into that drawer, and you took that pen, and it's mine.
Okay, for "fine-point gel-tip"... substitute "confidential source deep within the administration. "
You get a little thrill, don't you?
Hang on a sec.
Hey.
Question: have you ever heard anything about Luke's dark day?
His what?
Well, one day a year, he apparently has a dark day.
No one knows where he goes or what he does.
He just disappears.
I've heard nothing about this.
Okay, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?
How am I supposed to know?
Because you keep all those crazy, anal Bob Graham kind of notebooks.
"8:00 a. m.: got up. 8:15: brushed teeth.
"8:25: had impure thoughts.
8:36: sent dwarves off to work. "
I do not have my diaries from last November... on me at the moment.
- But you do have them.
- Yes.
And they will contain where we ate breakfast that morning.
Yes.
- I love my little circus freak.
- I'll call you later.
- Did your Mini-Me show up?
- Yeah, her name's Anna.
She's right here.
- How's the tour going?
- It's going great.
How many boring bench lectures did you give?
Two, but they were about the same bench.
You know what?
I have someone standing abnormally close to me, right now.
- I'll call you later?
- Okay, say hi to Kirk for me.
Okay, bye.
Kirk, what can I do for you?
- I have a business proposition for you.
- Okay.
- How often do you slip in your tub?
- Never.
Okay, it doesn't work if you answer like that.
Constantly.
I never stop slipping, even when I get out.
I thought so.
Then my new line... of bath-and-shower adhesive decals are for you.
"Yesterday, today, and tomorrow. "
Yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors... with tomorrow's traction technology.
Well, Kirk, this looks very impressive and, wow, very expensive.
Well, it's yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors... with tomorrow's traction technology.
Well, why don't you leave the catalog with me... and I'll look it over?
Could you look at it now?
It's my only one.
Okay.
I like that one.
If you put the fishes' faces together, it looks like they're kissing.
Hey, Kirk, do you know anything about Luke's dark day?
- Everyone knows about Luke's dark day.
- Do you know what it is?
Not the details, just that he has it once a year.
- I think it goes back a long, long time.
- Yeah?
Sure, I mean, Luke's always had a touch of darkness in him.
I guess we all do, but...
Luke's a little more touched than some.
He's kind of grabbed, actually.
What do you think it's about?
When I was in seventh grade, Luke knocked the books out of my hands.
Because of his dark day?
No, everyone knocked my books out of my hands.
I was kind of a target.
I used to wear a cape to school.
Now, outside, we just passed the women's table... which was designed by Maya Lin.
She's also the one who designed the Vietnam War Memorial... which, by the way, originally was a class project... for which she received a B.
The teacher who gave her the B... also submitted a design for the war memorial... but hers was chosen.
His was not.
That's a life lesson to remember.
This is Sterling Memorial Library.
One of my favorite places on campus.
It was built in 1930, and it houses over one-third... of the university's 10 million volumes.
I love libraries.
I just spend I can't tell you how many hours just...
- You're not writing.
- Oh, sorry.
- So I come here sometimes, late at night-
- I just love how everybody's dressed.
- What?
- No uniforms.
I love that there's no uniforms.
- College to me means no more uniforms.
- Oh, right.
However, wait till you're late for class... and it takes you 20 minutes to put together an outfit.
Suddenly you'll miss those uniforms.
How many guys have you dated since you've been here?
Oh, well, none from Yale.
Anyhow, the books.
Are you seeing the books?
Everything you'd want to read is right here.
Feel it.
Feels good, right?
Now smell it.
Nothing, nothing, smells like that.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Did I just see you smell that book?
- Hey, Logan.
- Hey, Ace.
Who's your friend?
Oh, Anna, this is Logan.
Logan, this is Anna.
She's from my high school.
- I'm showing her around campus.
- Hi.
Well, high school?
Nah, I would've sworn you're a college girl.
- So, is she showing you a good time?
- I'm showing her everything important.
Good.
Make sure she takes you by the pub.
Local place.
Everyone goes there.
- I'm not taking her to the pub.
- Oh, please?
The pub sounds fun.
You don't have to drink.
They do have coffee.
It's a cool scene.
Make her take you.
Bring a book to sniff.
What are you doing in a library anyhow?
Got lost.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
Ruin my rep.
Anna, it's been a pleasure.
See you, Ace.
- He's cute.
- Yes, he is, but not as cute as Pushkin.
Right this way, missy.
- Fine.
Do whatever you want.
- Well, I'm sorry you're so upset.
You're giving me a week's notice.
What am I supposed to do with a week's notice?
Well, my son just called me from Florida to tell me the condo moved.
Okay, fine, go.
Enjoy Florida.
I hear they have great weather there.
Terrific hurricanes.
Make sure you bring plenty of plywood and bottled water.
- Hey, hi, hello.
- What are you doing here?
I was just driving down the street, and I saw you.
I thought I'd stop by and say "hey, hi, hello. "
- Hello, Mrs. Thompson.
- Hello, dear.
- So what's going on?
- Nothing.
Nothing's going on.
Luke, please understand.
There's nothing I can do.
I've already found someone to rent the house.
And they have cars.
- And you just agreed to that?
- Well, it seemed rather reasonable to me.
Oh, come on.
- Luke's very upset with me.
- Why?
Well, his father rented the garage.
He was building a boat, and he didn't have room at his place... so he paid me to do it here.
And then when he died, Luke continued to pay for the garage.
And now I'm moving to a nursing home, and I need him to move his boat.
You're mad because this little old lady is moving to a nursing home... and you have to move your boat?
Is this really the story you want to stick to?
She called me out of the blue, and I paid for an entire month.
I can give you a partial refund if you like.
Where am I supposed to find a space to store a boat... on a moment's notice?
Did you think about that for even a second?
Could we sit down?
The doctor says the screw in my hip is loose.
Yes, yes, let's sit.
Let's sit and calmly try to figure this out.
No, no.
I've got it figured out.
Just haul it off.
Trash it.
- Haul what off?
- The boat?
Yes, the boat.
Scrap it.
Find somebody to drag it away...
- and cut it up for firewood.
- Oh, now, Luke.
Who's gonna haul it off?
Anyone.
Just find a guy with a truck and a hook.
And strap it on and drive it away and send me the bill.
- I'm done.
- Luke.
We'll be right back.
Luke, stop.
What, what, and what?
I have been paying that woman every month for 15 years.
Luke, she's moving to a nursing home.
And my dad was paying her every month 20 years before that.
- Nursing home, Luke.
- I know where she's going.
- She's not trying to hurt you.
- Whatever.
- Where are you going?
- Back to the diner.
- Let me drive you.
- No.
I can drive you back to the diner.
I promise if we pass any senior citizens, I'll let you jump out and pants them.
Fine.
And over here we have the world-famous Luke's Diner... home of the best coffee on the East Coast... and the most delightful and chatty proprietor... since Mel kissed Flo's grits.
Okay, well, I should get back to the inn.
I hope you've enjoyed your tour... and don't forget to buy yourself a souvenir plastic monkey on the way out.
Tomorrow's the anniversary of my dad's death.
Oh, hon...
And every year on that anniversary...
I disappear.
I don't work.
I don't talk to anyone.
I get into kind of a funk.
It's like...
You have a dark day.
Yeah, I have a dark day.
I thought I should tell you this because we're in a relationship.
I thought you might wonder... why I suddenly don't answer the phone or I'm not around.
Why you can't flip your hair... and con me into going to Miss Patty's crazy anniversary party.
- The hair flip is that effective?
- You combine that with your black dress... you could probably get me to be your backup dancer.
I'll remember that.
I've never told anyone this before.
I don't really like to talk about it.
I guess that explains the thing with Mrs. Thompson.
Yeah.
Some timing, her springing this boat thing on me now.
I'll apologize to her.
You know, he never finished that boat.
It's been sitting there half-done for 15 years.
Hey, Luke, don't you think you might have been... a little too hasty about the boat decision?
I mean, you're upset... and I bet someday you're gonna be really sorry... you don't have that boat anymore.
No, it's better she gets rid of the thing now.
- But-
- I haven't even looked at that boat... since my dad got sick.
It's...
- Not a glance, nothing.
- Even more reason.
If it's gone, then I don't have to deal with it.
It's time to move on, you know?
- But-
- I'm fine, really.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Anytime.
- I love it here.
- You love it here?
We just walked in.
I know, but it feels so collegiate.
Actually, you know what is great about this place?
- Eli Yale drank here?
- No, they make amazing cappuccinos.
- You want one?
- Yeah.
- Okay, you go sit, and I'll get the coffees.
- Okay.
- Two cappuccinos, please.
- Sure thing.
Hey.
- Hi, you just get here?
- Yeah.
- You want a...
- Yes, please.
I'm sorry.
Could you make that three cappuccinos?
So, how's it going?
I think I may have overwhelmed Anna.
Her hand cramped up about an hour ago.
And it's been spasming ever since.
- Where is she?
- She's right...
- Really?
- You wanna go to a party tonight?
I turn around for one minute.
Excuse me.
Oh, Rory, Mark and Matthew were just telling me... about a great party tonight.
Really?
That was very nice of them.
Thank you, Matthew and Mark, was it?
- That's right.
- Well, how biblical.
Okay, well, our schedule is completely full at the moment... but if that changes, if things lighten up... or if she suddenly ages two years in the next three hours... then we'll know where to find you, okay?
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
We'll be over here, just in case.
- Rory.
- Anna.
Oh, this is so not fair.
You get to talk to boys.
What?
Well, you were over there talking to Marty.
That's different.
Marty's just a friend, which is another great thing about college.
You learn to have guy friends.
Nothing romantic, just a good pal.
Those boys are not interested in your friendship... unless the word "friendship" is tattooed on your butt.
Now, drink your coffee.
It's good, huh?
Can I sleep with the TV on?
Yeah, as long as you don't wake Paris up.
And that advice is for your own good.
- And if I can't go to sleep?
- Then you don't go to sleep.
I love that.
I love not having someone tell me when to go to sleep.
- Yes, it's great.
- I love sleeping with the TV on... and I love having no parents around, and I love cappuccino... and I love apple muffins, and I love college.
What's she on?
Four cappuccinos and the three Red Bulls from the fridge.
- Enjoy your night.
How do I look?
- Where are you going?
I'm putting myself out there, Rory.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
It's 11:00 at night.
Who are you hoping to hook up with now, Spike and Drusilla?
- Just tell me if my lipstick is too whorish.
- No, just whorish enough.
Going out at 11:00 at night?
I love college.
I may suffocate her when I get back.
- Hey, if you can catch her.
- Bye.
Good luck.
- Good night, Anna.
- Night.
Which brings us to this question:
Does Campbell's work successfully resolve the disparate stances of Jung and Freud... when it comes to the collective unconscious?
Hey, pay attention.
Professor Bell is one of the foremost philosophy professors in the country.
- Sorry.
- ... bordered on being metaphysical?
All right, let's call that close enough.
But now, Campbell can point to the repetition of the hero myth... in culture after culture and say:
"Hey, Sigmund, like it or not...
"here are the same basic characters over and over"-
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm right in the middle of a class, young man.
I know.
I'm sorry, I just...
Rory, you can't just walk out like that.
Not after everything we've been through.
You just left.
I was still in bed.
I mean, what is that all about?
Okay, you need to do this later.
I can't do this later.
Rory, I love you.
I love you, damn it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
God, just talk to me.
- Okay, out.
Right now.
Just get-
- Colin.
What are you doing, man?
Get the hell out of here.
She's with me now.
I told you.
Let it go.
- I will not let it go.
- She doesn't love you.
Rory, tell him you don't love him.
Everything was fine until you came along.
Don't blame me 'cause you couldn't keep her.
- I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh, I'd love to see you try.
Stop it.
Stop it right now.
Anthony, get security.
Break it up.
What are you...
Gentlemen, you are losing control.
You're in a classroom with students...
All right, that's enough.
Break it up, you two.
Rory Gilmore, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Toying with these boys like this.
They used to have pride.
They used to have dignity.
They used to have balls.
Damn it, Gilmore, give them back their balls.
- God, this is a lot of junk.
- I know.
Who has three Thighmasters besides Suzanne Somers?
Well, Mrs. Thompson, apparently.
You'd think if you had three Thighmasters, you'd wear some slacks once in a while.
I'm sorry, but why exactly did you have to take all this crap?
It was the only way I could get her to give me the boat.
Some guy wanted it, and she got him to buy all her other crap.
So if I wanted the boat, I had to take everything... and that's what I did.
I just have to hide it for a few days, then I'll move it.
- Where?
- I don't know.
Somewhere.
The inn.
I'll put it in the old stable out back.
- Are you ever gonna tell Luke?
- Yes.
- When?
- A week, a year.
I haven't thought that far in advance.
I just couldn't let her get rid of his dad's boat.
What if we hang the Thighmasters on it?
- Or get more trees.
- Yeah, or get more trees.
- Jackson's got some trees at home.
- Think I could borrow them?
Sure, we'll just wait till he lies down for his nap and sneak them out.
Great, then I'll hop a fence... and get Richard Widmark to sign my grapefruit.
I'd like to welcome you all to today's speed-dating session.
Many of you have been with us before.
Many of you are first-timers.
For the latter group, here are the rules.
Each couple will have one minute to talk... and get a sense of the person across from them.
When the bell rings, the women will get up and switch tables.
Men, stay where you are.
This will continue until every woman has met every man... and after that, it's up to you.
Are we all ready?
Then let the dating begin.
- I'm Jack.
- Paris.
Did your parents travel a lot?
- Why?
- Your name is Paris.
No.
Did your parents change flat tires a lot?
What?
- Or plug the phone into the wall a lot?
- No.
Great, so we've cleared up that mystery.
What's next on your fascinating list of talking points?
- What's your major?
- Seriously?
You've got one minute to make an impression... and that's all you can come up with?
You want to know my sign, too, Jack?
Or how about my favorite color?
Or if I'm a Britney or a Christina?
Here, I'll ask you a question.
Was the last time you had an interesting thought... when you considered flinging yourself off a building?
Bye, Jack.
I'll write Mother immediately.
Paris, and no, my parents didn't travel.
Billy, and I have no idea what that means.
- Never mind.
So, what's your story, Billy?
- Well, I'm a drama major.
- Doyle.
- Paris.
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I could say the same for you.
So, you find any good prospects?
- Yes, one girl wants to have 11 children.
- Good God.
The second one was cut off quickly.
Thank you, by the way.
The words "Latter-Day Saints" were about to come out of her mouth.
- I can't believe I came here.
- It's my third time.
You ever meet anyone you actually wanted to date?
My bar is so not that high.
I don't see one person in this room that shouldn't be sterilized immediately.
Right there with you.
So, you've been reading about those skeletons... they've been finding on the island of Flores, right?
Oh, yeah.
They're only 13,000 years old.
That's nothing in geological time.
They made tools and probably had a language and-
Keep moving, sister.
Hey, you know they were supposed to be master hunters.
Even though they were diminutive in size.
And then, when that other guy came in in that outfit... how great was that?
We also studied Dylan Thomas today.
Why don't we talk about that for a while?
Yeah, that was cool.
But when Logan and Colin started to fight, that was so amazing.
The teacher had nothing to say, nothing.
He just stood there.
- Think they'll get in trouble for that?
- Oh, probably not.
God, that's great.
The freedom.
I mean, you can do anything in college.
No rules, no consequences.
Anna, there are always consequences.
You're getting the wrong idea.
College is not just a crazy, wild, sleep-deprived hedonistic society.
- Oh.
It wasn't the TV.
- No, it wasn't the TV.
- This isn't what it looks like.
- I hope not.
- I told you it wasn't the TV.
- Hi, Paris.
- All right, fine.
Doyle and I had sex.
- Okay, Anna, get your coat.
We met at speed-dating, and we considered having dinner first... but we both knew where it was going to end up, so we figured... we'd just cut to the chase and save the calories.
- Hurry up, Anna.
- Where are we going?
- Dinner.
- It's only 5:00.
You've no right to be repulsed by my sex life.
This is an exceptionally comfortable robe.
Dinner whenever you want, random sex whenever you want.
I can't wait to go to college.
- Ice cream and cereal for dinner.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
College rocks.
- Ladies.
- Hi, Logan.
- How are we doing this fine evening?
- We're doing great.
You want to join us?
Sure.
- So, dull day, huh?
- Not for me.
- Someone's quiet.
- Got nothing to say.
Do you get the sense that she's mad at me?
Yup.
Hey, Anna, why don't you head on over to the fro-yo social?
You remember where it is, right?
Yeah, but I just had three scoops of ice cream.
Kid, you're in college now, okay?
Now, go get yourself some yogurt.
Are you going to come, Logan?
I'm not sure how well I'll be walking, here, in a minute, Anna.
Oh, okay.
Bye.
That's not a good look.
- I have no words.
- It was just a joke.
Oh, no, wait.
I thought of some:
jerk, ass, arrogant, inconsiderate... mindless, frat-boy, lowlife, butt-faced miscreant.
"Butt-faced miscreant"?
- Why would you do something like that?
- I'm sorry, "butt-faced miscreant"?
Here I am, trying to show Anna what college life is really like-
- That is what college life is really like.
- Maybe your college life, not mine.
That was my class, Logan.
That was my professor who decides my grades... and you made me look ridiculous to him.
No, I made me look ridiculous to him.
Oh, you don't think he thinks I was a part of it?
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him you were an innocent bystander.
The whole class was in a frenzy the entire time.
We never got back to what we were talking about.
There's another class next week.
I know that classes and the paper and Yale in general... mean nothing to you, but it means something to me.
Professor Bell's course is only six weeks long... and you blew one of those weeks for me.
I won't get that week back.
Look, you want a close and personal time with Bell, my dad knows him.
- He'll arrange-
- Please stop talking.
I'm sorry you're so bent out of shape.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke.
If Anna thinks Yale is just a big joke after spending five minutes with you... then she was always gonna think Yale was just a big joke.
Relax.
You and me, very different people.
I have to go.
To the fro-yo social?
Yes, I have to go to the fro-yo social.
And yes, I do realize how incredibly stupid that just sounded.
Excuse me.
All I'm saying is I just want a little information.
Is this a relationship?
A one-night stand?
The beginning of a series of late-night booty calls?
I think I have the right to know.
I hear you.
Doyle, do you hear her?
I do hear her.
I just don't understand... why we can't decide this amongst ourselves.
Because you can't, Doyle.
Now, please tell Paris how you feel.
Well, I feel that-
Speak into the phone, Doyle.
I can't hear you.
- Is Anna here?
- No, why?
She didn't show up at the fro-yo social.
- Jeez, do you blame her.
- I have to find her.
Why?
Did you loan her money or something?
Just go back to what you were doing, please.
Hey, Marty, I lost Anna.
I don't know where.
Just...
Thanks.
If she comes back here, call me.
Go ahead, Doyle.
Tell him.
- Any idea where she'd go?
- No, she was supposed to meet me.
- I can't believe I let her go off by herself.
- Well, we'll find her.
- Mom.
- Hi.
Where would a 16-year-old girl go for a good time?
Oh, how sad that you had to come to me for this conversation.
- Mom.
- You were 16 a lot more recently than me.
- I lost Anna.
- How did you lose Anna?
She never showed at the fro-yo social.
Okay, relax. 16-year-old girl at college.
You have to check parties.
Bars and Chinese restaurants rarely card.
- No Chinese restaurants around.
- The pub.
Did you check the pub?
No.
The pub.
We have to check the pub.
Parties and the pub.
Okay, call me when you...
I have to go, hon.
Call me when you find her.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
- I smashed my leg on a Thighmaster.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, and then I tripped and smashed my other leg...
- on another Thighmaster.
- I'm sorry.
Why the hell do you have so many Thighmasters?
I have a really bad thigh complex.
Are you bleeding?
You want to come in?
No, I'm fine.
I just...
You left your glasses at my house.
- I thought you might need them.
- Thank you.
I didn't think you'd be here.
- I thought you were going to Patty's thing.
- I was just leaving.
- I don't have to go if you want to come in.
- No, it's okay.
I'm still going through my dark day.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Sorry about your foot.
- What's going on with your garage?
- What?
- Your garage door looks all weird.
- Oh, no, it's fine.
It's jammed.
Just leave it.
You can't leave it open like that.
You could ruin all your stuff.
That's okay.
Too much stuff anyhow.
If a little bit gets ruined... serves me right for being so darn materialistic.
- What are all these trees doing here?
- No, just stop.
Go back to your dark day.
No, no, don't, don't.
There's clowns in there and puppies wearing costumes... and they'll cheer you up, and then your dark day will be ruined.
What is this?
- It's your boat.
- I thought I told her to get rid of this boat.
She did.
She sold it to me with all of her other crap.
She made a killing, actually.
I just couldn't stand the idea... that you might regret someday giving this boat away.
- Even though I said I wanted it gone?
- Yes, I know, but you were upset.
- No, I was cranky.
Now I'm upset.
- I'm sorry.
I just thought-
You thought about you.
You thought about you and how you'd feel.
You didn't think about me or the fact that I said...
I wanted to get rid of this damn boat.
- I said it, you heard it, and you ignored it.
- Because I didn't want you-
You have no respect for what I wanted.
This was my dad.
This was his boat, and this decision was mine.
- This was not yours.
- I know.
This is who I am.
I don't want to hang on to things or stare at things.
Except my horoscope... which is absolutely the wrong thing to bring up right now.
I'm sorry.
- I'm getting out of here.
- No, I'm sorry.
Please, just stay and yell at me.
Why?
What's the point?
You don't listen to anything I say, anyhow.
- She's nowhere.
- She's not nowhere.
This is all my fault.
- There's more bars.
We'll find her.
- God, I'm so stupid.
If I didn't have to confront Logan like that...
I wouldn't have had to send her off on her own and we wouldn't be looking for her.
We'll find her.
He's so frustrating, that guy.
I mean, I don't know what I did to get on his bad side... or why he just has to come after me like-
- Oh, stop it.
- What?
He's not coming after you.
He likes you.
- He does not.
- Oh, please, Rory.
Marty, he does not like me.
I mean, look at what he did.
Look at that stunt that he pulled.
He totally humiliated me.
Attention like that from people like Logan is like being tapped.
- You've been anointed.
You're in.
- In what?
In with him, with his group.
He likes you.
- Stop being so naive.
It's annoying.
- Marty-
Hello?
Ms. Gilmore, Headmaster Charleston here.
Oh, hi, Headmaster Charleston.
What's going on?
Well, not much.
Thank you for asking.
I was just wondering how things are going with Miss Fairchild.
- Oh, fine.
- Yes?
Everything's great.
Wonderful.
Then I can inform Anna's parents... that the underage girl the Yale campus police found... when they broke up a rather raucous party is, in fact, not their daughter.
- I'm sorry, Headmaster Charleston.
- And what a help that is.
I tried.
I just...
I turned around for a moment.
Did she tell you about the bench?
'Cause I spent a lot of time-
I'm sorry, Ms. Gilmore.
I have to go.
Some angry parents will be here in a moment to talk to me.
I appreciate the attempt.
Good luck at Yale.
Bye, Headmaster Charleston.
The campus police got her.
She came, she spent one day with me, and she got sent home by the police.
And I think I'm going to retroactively flunk high school.
- At least she's safe, right?
- Right.
Crappy, crappy day.
You want to take a cab?
My treat.
Thanks.
I think I'm gonna walk.
- Marty...
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- What are you doing?
- I smell like trees.
You do?
Hey, me, too.
Now we're the crazy pine-scented ladies.
- How's your punch?
- It's good.
You okay?
Yeah, fine, just fine.
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.
I'm honored that you came here... to help me celebrate 40 wonderful years on the stage.
It feels so good to be here in front of an audience... and so close to a piano.
So close to a piano.
Kirk.
Sorry.
Hey, Patty, why don't you do a little something for us?
Well, if you insist.
Hit it.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
See, there's a reason...
I stay away from people on this particular day.
It's 'cause I kind of suck.
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.
I should have listened to you.
I should have stayed out of it.
You were right.
I didn't think.
I mean, I didn't think like you would think.
I thought like I would think... and my thinking is sometimes very, very wrong if you're not me.
And, occasionally, if you are me.
You just keep thinking like you'd think.
I can do that.
Do you want to come in?
You can get drunk... just standing next to the punch bowl.
- Nah, I'm still kind of...
- I get it.
- I just didn't want us to-
- We're not.
- Yeah.
You go have a good time.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah, you'll see me tomorrow.
- Okay.
Logan.
Richard?
Wow, this is a pleasant surprise.
- Finn, Colin, you know Richard, don't you?
- Well, hello, boys.
Nice to see you.
Logan, I wanted to talk to you.
I just heard about the incident.
- The...
- I heard that you professed your feelings...
- for Rory.
- What?
Mr. Bell is a very dear friend of mine.
As is the Dean of Admissions.
- You know this place.
News travels fast.
- Yeah, look-
I have to tell you that, while I understand what could have driven you... to such a public display of affection... there is a proper time and place for that sort of thing.
And a classroom in the middle of class is not one of them.
- No, I know.
I-
- However, what's done is done.
It's out.
So I dropped by to tell you that I've spoken to your father.
- My father.
- We pounded out a few things... property agreements, prenups, that sort of thing.
- Okay, I think there's been-
- We came to a very fair agreement.
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
Now, we're setting up a dinner for next week... to finalize the engagement and start talking about the ceremony.
Emily is handling all the newspaper announcements.
- So not to worry.
That's all taken care of.
- But-
She's a fine young lady, Logan.
I want her to be happy.
You'll take care of that, I assume.
All right, I'll let you get back to your coffee break.
Nice seeing all of you again.
And, Logan, welcome to the family, son.
I do hope one of his dopey-looking friends knows CPR... or he just might not make it.
You're the best, Grandpa.
All right, who's next?
Paris giving you any trouble?
Not any more than usual.
However, there is a girl in my modern poetry class... who keeps kicking my chair.
- I do love this place.
- Right back at you, Grandpa.
English
Whoa, honey!
Oh, I'm sorry Patty, I didn't see you there!
- Goodness, what's left to wear on your feet?
- I know, it's a sickness.
Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw but actually it came over on the Mayflower.
Oh, well, what a wonderful history lesson.
Any time.
Oh!
What the...
Pasquale's feeling unappreciated again.
We had "Star's Hollow Loves Pasquale Day" last week!
Didn't stick.
Oh, listen, I want to invite you to my anniversary party!
Absolutely!
Which husband?
Oh, no husband, honey, I'm talking about a lover that's been far more loyal and seductive than a husband.
I'm talking about that business we call show!
- Forty years!
- No!
Forty years ago today, I did my first play, off Broadway.
- Off Broadway?
- Cleveland.
That is off Broadway.
Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party.
Food, booze, a little song, a little dance, a little salsa down your pants.
- Well, count me and my pants in.
- Oh!
Wonderful!
I will even drag Luke there.
So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.
Oh, Luke won't come.
Sure he will, I have very effective methods of persuasion.
They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.
No, honey, the party's on Tuesday, the 30th.
- So?
- So, the 30th is the "dark day".
- What dark day?
- Luke's "dark day".
The day that he disappears.
Disappears?
Where?
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows where he goes or what he does, all we know is not to try and find him.
Why didn't I know about this?
I don't know, honey, everyone else does.
Anyhow, you come yourself, okay?
Eight o'clock!
I'll be there.
See you Tuesday, Patty.
Ah!
Pasquale, the Maestro!
My God, you look virile today.
Are you sure your wife won't share you?
Oh, she's good.
I don't agree.
You're living in a fantasy world.
I have classes all day long.
I hear you protesting.
I've got a double major of poli-sci and bio-chem, Terrence!
I see you over-scheduling.
Sorry, I'm just getting a water here.
Paris, you're not yelling at me, you're yelling at the world.
I'm not yelling at all.
This is the natural register of my voice.
It's the register of a timid little girl who is not putting herself out there.
I am putting myself out there!
Why are you arguing with Terrence?
Why?
Look.
I know I haven't dated lately, but Asher was very important to me.
Hey Paris, I can't find my notebook?
The black one with all the yellow notes in it.
You have not put yourself out there.
He just died.
Oh, for God's sake, he was halfway dead when you met him.
Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?
Out where?
Out in the world.
Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?
You don't just meet people!
It doesn't happen.
Um, I'll just go in my room now.
Look at your dream log, you are months behind.
And your pretty thoughts journal.
Okay, fine.
I have neglected thinking pretty.
But I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost while you were in court ordered rehab!
Hey Paris, what's this?
I had a back problem.
The prescription was at home in my File-o-fax.
This is a message from Headmaster Charleston.
When did Headmaster Charleston call?
- Earlier.
- And you didn't tell me?
I'm in session.
Hello, Headmaster Charleston, this is Rory Gilmore.
I'm sorry it took so long to call you back, I just got your message.
Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive.
We should talk later.
So, um, how are you?
I'm very well.
How are you enjoying Yale?
I love it!
Is it everything you thought it would be?
It's nothing like I thought it would be, it's better actually.
I have no doubt.
Now, I'm calling because we often ask a former Chilton student to host a prospective Yale student for a couple of days.
Show them around, let them observe classes, campus life, that sort of thing.
I was wondering if you'd be interested.
- Me?
- Yes, this is a very special young lady.
Bright, focused, quietly determined.
She reminds me a great deal of you.
- Thank you.
- I assume you haven't changed.
Well, I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit, but I'm basically still me.
Excellent.
Then I hope you'll consider accepting.
I know your workload must be substantial.
- That's okay.
I can handle it.
- So I can take that as a yes?
Yes.
Take it as a yes.
And thank you, I'm honored.
Her name is Anna Fairchild.
She's sixteen years old and she'll be arriving Monday morning at nine o'clock.
- Does that work for you?
- That works perfectly.
Very well, it's a date.
I'm very glad to talk to you again, Miss Gilmore.
Yale certainly sounds like it's agreeing with you.
I hope it will also agree with Miss Fairchild.
- Like Sabrina!
- I beg your pardon?
Sabrina Fairchild, that was her name.
Have we segued into discussing a movie?
And we can segue right out again.
I'm very grateful for that.
All right then, my office will be contacting you with the particulars.
I hope you have a wonderful time.
I'm sure Miss Fairchild will.
Thank you, Headmaster Charleston, I won't let you down.
What I nice thing to hear.
I'm sure we'll be talking soon.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Well this is a very big honor, you know.
- Oh, I know.
Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale, they're asking you.
I know!
I know.
Well, have you thought about what kinds of things you'd like to show her?
Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course.
And then I thought she'd got to the paper with me and then I thought maybe a trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library.
Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.
- Steve?
- Bible.
Right.
Then I was torn between taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle or the Science Center and gymnasium.
Huh.
That is a conundrum.
Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then, you'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.
Lorelai, these things are of great interest to any young person considering attending Yale.
Oh, I am sure.
I, personally, would enjoy every single thing on my list.
Yes, I know.
But it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in.
I'm not talking a kegger, but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling "Give me a location" or something like that.
- You know, your mother may be right.
- Who heard that?
Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience.
It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun, too.
Oh, have her touch the toe!
- Yeah!
- Touch the toe?
The toe!
The statue of Theodore Woolsey.
It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet.
And for that reason he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.
Wow, that is fun!
Make sure you get a parent consent form for that one.
Oh, it is so exciting watching you at Yale.
Such a wonderful time for me.
The people that you meet there will stay with you for the rest of your life, mark my words.
Tell me, are you making good friends?
Yeah, I have some good friends.
And what about Mr. Huntzberger?
Who's Mr. Huntzberger?
Um, Logan Huntzberger's a boy I go to school with.
A fine boy, from a fine family.
- You know him?
- His parents are very good friends of ours.
Oh, you know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai!
No.
He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.
No.
His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.
Oh!
...
No.
Well, Logan is their son.
And I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night?
The other night?
He's very nice, Grandpa.
I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.
Uh, was this Logan at the "Male Yale" party you threw?
He's the one who gave me a ride home, Mom.
Oh, Limo boy.
Swell.
He's also on the paper with me.
You know, his father owns some of the finest papers in the country.
- I know.
- Not a bad connection, huh?
Nope, not a bad connection at all.
- Hey!
So tell me about this Logan.
- It's three degrees out here.
Uh, as of tonight my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do.
That's not right or fair.
He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do.
For him the dish is always half empty.
You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?
What is the deal with this guy?
Are you dating?
No, we're not dating!
He's just a friend.
How close?
For example, if we freeze to death will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?
I know him from school, he's just a casual friend, that's it.
- Do you think he's cute?
- What does it matter if I think he's cute?
Uh, it matters to me.
I don't want ugly grandchildren.
Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone.
Since Dean, I'm taking a boy break, okay?
- I'm just concentrating on school, that's it.
- Fine.
If that changes?
- You'll be the first to know.
- 'Kay.
Thank you.
- 'Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father.
- I know.
Info on you and looking better in chiffon, that's about it.
Oh, and my pole-dance is way hotter.
- I'm frozen now.
- Okay.
Let's go.
In my hand, ladies and gentlemen, sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner.
I am never more than ten feet away from pie.
Ah, see, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.
Oh, it's heaven!
One quick trip downstairs and I have all the treats I want.
- You're like Willy Wonka but hotter.
- I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.
Slap on a purple top hat and you're close.
This is nice.
I think it's going very well, you and me.
You think it's going very well?
I have very few complaints.
Hmm.
I'm going right past the very few complaints comment, 'cause I know you're just trying to bait me.
What complaints?
Hey, so Luke?
Miss Patty is celebrating her forty year anniversary.
Which husband?
With the business we call show.
Oh, him.
And she's having a big party and I told her we'd go.
Oh, man.
It'll be fun.
It will not be fun.
She'll be wearing tap shoes, and there'll be songs and punch and at least one story about Milton Berle's penis.
- Only one?
- Come on!
I have to have you there.
- Otherwise people will think I made you up.
- Fine.
I'll go.
Thank you.
Okay, so it's Tuesday at eight o'clock.
I can't go Tuesday.
- Why not?
- I have to go out of town.
- Why?
- Business.
Business?
Now you're Willy Loman?
Banking business in Woodbury, standing appointment.
Sorry.
Hit the light, will you?
I have to get up early. 'Night.
Okay. 'Night.
Wait till you see all the stuff I got for Anna.
Yale tee-shirt.
Bulldogs sweatshirt.
Yale baseball cap.
Visor.
Coffee mug.
I told you to open a window when you're hot gluing in here.
It's freezing outside.
Oh, wait.
This is new, they just came out with this.
The Yale soda cozy.
How cute is that?
I can't believe you.
You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore, and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know?
I'm trying to make her feel welcome.
Oh, she'll feel welcome.
They all feel welcome.
- Who's "they"?
- The enemy.
Who's the enemy?
Any girl under the age of seventeen is the enemy.
- Okay, I'm opening a window now.
- They're coming for everything.
They're going to take our jobs, our thunder, our starter husbands.
- Don't you have a class to get to?
- They're coming, Rory.
They're coming, and they are going to keep on coming.
Like the locusts descending on Mankato.
We'll be beating them off for the rest of our lives.
Please don't be here when she arrives, I don't want you to scare her off.
Me?
Scare her off?
Please.
She's the one with the alabaster skin and the perky breasts.
Do not say "perky breasts" to her, do you understand me?
Eve Harrington has arrived.
Hi.
I'm looking for Rory Gilmore?
- I'm Rory, you must be Anna.
- Yes.
Great, come in.
You find it okay?
I got lost a couple of times, but people were really nice and got me here.
Yeah, it's a friendly world out there, isn't it?
Anna, this is my roommate Paris, and I'm sorry.
For what?
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Okay, let me show you around the place.
That is Paris' room.
Don't go in.
That is my room, and this is the common room which is also your bedroom.
Bathroom is literally outside the door.
And there's a fridge, with water or soda or whatever you want - oh!
And I got you some welcome to Yale gifts!
Oh!
Really?
Thank you.
I'm really glad you're here.
You are going to love Yale, it's an amazing place.
I mean, I was excited when I first started here, but every day is different and better.
You have no idea how much there is to learn.
It's - oh, well, you'll see.
Okay.
I actually snagged us some caviar.
They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos and achieve a very similar result.
Hey.
- This is Anna.
- Did Paris move?
- I'm right here, Marty.
- I know, Paris.
Anna is from Chilton, my alma mater, and I'm showing her around Yale for a couple days.
Oh, cool.
I'll put this in the fridge.
In my room.
Thanks!
Okay, you ready?
I'm ready.
You have boys bringing you food?
Yale is a magical place, Anna.
A magical, magical place.
The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the old campus, and it houses most of the undergraduate freshman class.
It was begun be Theodore Dwight Woolsey, president of Yale from 1846 to 1871.
Over here is the Elihu Yale bench.
Now, Eli Yale was an officer in the British East Indian Company.
He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds and 417 books and a portrait of King George the first.
And so it was renamed in his honor.
He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school but Yale College never recieved it because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existing Collegiate School, apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him.
Oh, wait.
This is the wrong bench.
So keep the story, but cross out the diagram.
Moving on.
There's actually an ongoing rumor that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
Imagine all the tables you could wait with those skills, huh?
Okay.
You are about to get a first-hand feel of what it's like to work on a real newspaper.
Now be prepared.
It is an extremely hectic, fast-paced environment.
Don't get intimidated and don't get in the way.
Ready?
Here it is.
Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something.
But you just wait.
It can heat up in a second, and when it does, man, watch out.
My desk is over here.
I do not care!
Hey!
I am your editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me!
I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.
You will if you want to stay on this newspaper!
Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalistic dilemmas between reporter and editor - the right to protect sources.
Damn it, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now!
The pen fairy.
That is one of my personal fine point gel tipped pens from my bottom right hand drawer.
And you went into that drawer and you took that pen and it's mine!
Okay.
For "fine point gel tips" substitute "confidential source deep within the administration".
Huh?
You get a little thrill, don't you?
Hang on a sec.
Hey.
Question.
Have you ever heard anything about Luke's "dark day"?
His what?
Well, one day a year he apparently has a "dark day".
No one knows where he goes or what he does, he just disappears.
I've heard nothing about this.
Okay, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?
How am I supposed to know?
Because, you keep all those crazy anal Bob Graham kind of notebooks.
"Eight a.m., got up.
Eight fifteen, brushed teeth.
Eight twenty-five, had impure thoughts.
Eight thirty-six, sent dwarves off to work."
I do not have my diaries from last November on me at the moment.
- But you do have them.
- Yes.
And they will contain where we ate breakfast that morning.
- Yes.
- I love my little circus freak.
- I call you later.
- Hey, did your Mini-Me show up?
Yeah, her name's Anna.
She's right here.
- Oh, how's the tour going?
- It's going great.
How many boring bench lectures did you give?
Two.
But they were about the same bench.
Oh, you know what?
I have someone standing abnormally close to me right now.
I'll call you later?
Okay, say hi to Kirk for me.
'Kay, bye.
Kirk!
What can I do for you?
- I have a business proposition for you.
- Okay.
- How often do you slip in your tub?
- Never.
- Okay, it doesn't work if you answer like that, so...
- Constantly.
I never stop slipping even when I get out.
I thought so.
Then my new line of bath and shower adhesive decals are for you.
Huh. "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
Yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
Well, Kirk this looks very impressive.
And wow, very expensive.
Well, it's yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
Hmm.
Well, why don't you leave the catalogue with me and I'll look it over?
- Could you look at it now?
It's the only one I have.
- Okay.
I like that one.
If you put the fishes' faces together it looks like they're kissing.
Oh, hey, Kirk.
Do you know anything about Luke's dark day?
Everyone knows about Luke's dark day.
Do you know what it is?
Not the details, just that he has it once a year.
I think it goes back a long, long time.
Yeah?
Sure, I mean, Luke's always had a touch of darkness in him.
I guess we all do, but Luke's a little more touched than some.
He's kind of grabbed, actually.
What do you think it's about?
When I was in seventh grade, Luke knocked the books out of my hands.
Because of his dark day?
No, everyone knocked my books out of my hands.
I was kind of a target.
I used to wear a cape to school.
Now, outside, we just passed the women's table, which was designed by Maya Lin.
She's also the one who designed the Vietnam War memorial, which, by the way, originally was a class project for which she received a 'B'.
The teacher who gave the 'B' also submitted a design for the war memorial, but hers was chosen.
His was not.
That's a life lesson to remember.
This is Sterling Memorial Library.
One of my favorite places on campus.
It was built in 1930 and it houses over one third of the University's ten million volumes.
I love libraries.
I just spend I can't tell you how many hours just - you're not writing.
Oh.
Sorry.
- I come here sometimes late at night...
- I just love how everybody's dressed.
- What?
- No uniforms.
I love that there's no uniforms.
College, to me, means no more uniforms.
Oh, right.
However, wait till you're late for class and it takes you twenty minutes to put together an outfit.
Suddenly you'll miss those uniforms.
How many guys have you dated since you've been here?
Oh, well, none from Yale.
Anyhow, the books - are you seeing the books?
Everything you'd want to read is right here.
Feel it.
Feels good, right?
Now smell it.
Nothing, nothing smells like that.
I'm sorry, excuse me - did I just see you smell that book?
- Hey, Logan.
- Hey, Ace.
Who's your friend?
Oh, Anna, this is Logan.
Logan, this is Anna, she's from my high school.
- I'm showing her around campus.
- Hi.
High school?
Naw, I woulda sworn you were a college girl.
- So is she showing you a good time?
- I'm showing her everything important.
Mmm.
Good.
Make sure she takes you by the pub.
Local place, everyone goes there.
- I'm not taking her to the pub.
- Oh, please?
The pub sounds fun.
You don't have to drink, they do have coffee.
It's a cool scene, make her take you.
Bring a book to sniff!
- What are you doing in a library anyhow?
- Got lost.
Don't tell anyone I was here, ruin my rep.
Anna, it's been a pleasure.
See you, Ace.
He's cute.
Yes, he is.
But not as cute as Pushkin.
Right this way, missy.
I'm not being mean, I'm just
- Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Well I'm sorry you're so upset!
Well, you're giving me a week's notice!
What am I supposed to do with a week's notice?
Well my son just called me from Florida, telling me about the condo, Luke!
Okay fine, go!
And enjoy Florida, I hear they have great weather there.
Terrific hurricanes!
Make sure you bring plenty of plywood and bottled water!
- Hey, hi, hello!
- What are you doing here?
I was just driving down the street and I saw you guys, thought I'd stop by and say hey, hi, hello.
- Hello Mrs. Thompson.
- Hello, dear.
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing.
Nothing's going on.
Luke, please understand there's nothing I can do!
I've already found someone else to rent the house and they have cars!
- And you just agreed to that!
- Well, it seemed rather reasonable to me!
- Oh, come on!
- Um...
- Luke's very upset with me.
- Why?
Well, his father rented the garage, he was building a boat and he didn't have room at his place, so he paid me to do it here.
And then when he died, Luke continued to pay me for the garage, and now I'm moving to a nursing home and I need him to move his boat!
You're mad because this little old lady is moving to a nursing home and you have to move your boat.
Is this really the story you want to stick to?
She called me out of the blue, and I've paid for an entire month.
I can give you a partial refund if you like.
Where am I supposed to find a space to store a boat on a moment's notice?
Huh?
Did you think about that for even a second?
Could we sit down?
The doctor says the screw in my hip is loose.
Yes, yes, let's sit and calmly try to figure this out.
No, no, I've got it figured out.
Just haul it off!
Trash it!
- Haul what off?
- The boat?
Yes, the boat.
Scrap it.
Find somebody to drag it away and cut it up for firewood!
- Oh, now Luke...
- Who's going to haul it off?
Anyone.
Just find a guy with a truck and a hook.
Strap it on and drive it away and send me the bill.
I'm done!
Luke - we'll be right back.
Luke, stop!
What, what and what?
I have paid that woman every month for fifteen years!
Luke, she's moving to a nursing home!
And my dad was paying her every month for twenty years before that!
- Nursing home, Luke!
- I know where she's going!
- She's not trying to hurt you.
- Whatever.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back to the diner.
- Let me drive you.
- No.
Look, I can drive you back to the diner.
I promise if we pass any senior citizens I'll let you jump out and pants them.
Fine.
And here we have the world famous Luke's diner, home of the best coffee on the east coast and the most delightful and chatty proprietor since Mel kissed Flo's grits.
Okay, well, I should get back to the Inn.
I hope you've enjoyed your tour and don't forget to buy yourself a souvenir plastic monkey on the way out.
Tomorrow's the anniversary of my dad's death.
Oh - oh, hon...
And every year on that anniversary...
I disappear.
I don't work.
I don't talk to anyone.
I get in kind of a funk - it's like... um...
- You have a "dark day".
- Yeah.
I have a dark day.
I thought I should tell you this because we're in a relationship, and I thought you might wonder why I suddenly don't answer the phone, or I'm not around.
Why you can't flip your hair and con me into going to Miss Patty's crazy anniversary party.
The hair flip is that effective, huh?
Combine that with your black dress, you could probably get me to be your backup dancer.
I'll remember that.
I've never told anyone this before.
I don't really like to talk about it.
I guess that explains the thing with Mrs. Thompson.
Yeah.
Some timing, her springing this boat thing on me now.
I'll apologize to her.
You know, I never finished that boat.
It's been sitting there half done for fifteen years.
Hey, Luke, don't you think you might have been a little hasty about the boat decision?
I mean, you were upset, and I bet some day you're going to be really sorry you don't have that boat anymore.
No, it's better she gets rid of the thing now.
But...
I haven't even looked at that boat since my dad got sick.
Not a glance, nothing.
Even more reason.
If it's gone, then I don't have to deal with it.
It's time to move on, you know?
- But...
- I'm fine.
Really.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Any time.
- I love it here!
- You love it here?
We just walked in!
I know, but it feels so collegiate!
Actually, you know what is great about this place?
Eli Yale drank here?
No, they make amazing cappuccinos.
You want one?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You go sit and I'll get the coffees.
- Two cappuccinos, please.
- Sure thing.
- Hey.
- Hi, you just get here?
Yep.
- You want a...
- Yes, please.
I'm sorry, could you make that three cappuccinos?
- So how's it going?
- I think I may have overwhelmed Anna.
Her hand cramped up about an hour ago, and it's been smasming ever since.
- Really?
Where is she?
- She's right there...
I turn around for one minute.
Excuse me.
Rory, Mark and Matthew were just telling me about a great party tonight.
Really, well that was very nice of them.
Thank you, Matthew and Mark, was it?
- That's right.
- Well, how biblical.
Okay, well, our schedule is completely full at the moment, but if that changes - if things lighten up, or if she suddenly ages two years in the next three hours, then we'll know where to find you.
Okay?
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
We'll be over here, just in case.
- Rory!
- Anna!
Well this is so not fair.
You get to talk to boys.
- What?
- Well, you were over there talking to Marty.
That's different.
Marty's just a friend.
Which is another great thing about college.
You learn to have guy friends.
Nothing romantic, just a good pal.
Those boys are not interested in your friendship, unless the word "friendship" is tattooed on your butt.
Now drink your coffee.
It's good, huh?
Can I sleep with the TV on?
Um, yeah, as long as you don't wake Paris up, and that advice is for your own good.
- And if I can't go to sleep?
- Then you don't go to sleep.
I love that!
I love not having someone to tell me when to go to sleep.
Yes, it's great.
I love sleeping with the TV on, and I love having no parents around, and I love cappuccino, and I love apple muffins, and I love college!
What's she on?
Four cappuccinos and three Red Bulls from the fridge.
Enjoy your night.
How do I look?
- Where are you going?
- I'm putting myself out there, Rory.
- Now?
- Yes now.
It's eleven o'clock at night, who are you hoping to hook up with now, Spike and Drusilla?
Just tell me if my lipstick is too whorish.
Nope, just whorish enough.
Going out at eleven o'clock at night?
I love college!
I may suffocate her when I get back.
Hey, if you can catch her.
- Bye.
- Good luck.
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.
Which brings us to this question.
Does Campbell's work successfully resolve the disparate stances of Jung and Freud when it comes to the collective unconscious?
...
Hey, pay attention.
Professor Bell is one of the foremost philosophy professors in the country.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- ... archetypes bordering on metaphysical?
All right.
Let's call that close enough.
But now, Camel can point to the repetition of the hero myth in culture after culture and say, "Hey Sigmund!
Like it or not, here are the same basic characters over and over"...
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I'm right in the middle of a class, young man.
I know, I'm sorry.
Rory, you can't just walk out like that.
Not after everything we've been through.
You just left.
I was still in bed, I mean, what is that all about?
- Okay, you need to do this later.
- I can't do this later.
Rory, I love you.
I love you, damn it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
God, just talk to me!
- Okay, out!
Right now, just get...
- Colin!
What are you doing, man?
- Get the hell out of here!
- She's with me now, I told you that.
Let it go.
I will not let it go!
She doesn't love you, Rory, tell him you don't love him!
- Everything was fine until you came along!
- Don't blame me 'cause you couldn't keep her!
- I swear to God, I'm going to kill you.
- Oh, I'd love to see you try.
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
Anthony, get security!
Stop - break it up!
What are you - gentlemen!
You are losing control!
You are in a classroom, stop it!
All right, that's enough, break it up, you two!
Rory Gilmore, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Toying with these boys like this.
They used to have pride.
They used to have dignity.
They used to have balls.
Damn it Gilmore, give 'em back their balls!
- God, this is a lot of junk.
- I know.
I mean, who has three Thigh Masters, besides Suzanne Somers.
Well, Mrs. Thompson, apparently.
You'd think if she had three Thigh Masters she'd wear some slacks once in a while.
And, I'm sorry, why exactly did you have to take all this crap?
It was the only way I could get her to give me the boat.
Some guy wanted it, and she got him to buy all her other crap, so if I wanted the boat I had to take everything, and that's what I did.
I just have to hide it for a few days, then I'll move it.
Where?
I don't know.
Somewhere.
The Inn!
I'll put it in the old stable out back.
- Are you ever going to tell Luke?
- Yes!
- Oh, when?
- A week, a year
- I haven't thought that far in advance.
I just couldn't let her get rid of his dad's boat!
What if we hang the Thigh Masters on it?
- Or get more trees!
- Yeah, or get more trees!
- Jackson's got some trees at home.
- Think I could borrow them?
Sure!
We'll just wait 'till he lies down for his nap and sneak them right out of there.
Great.
Then I'll hop a fence and get Richard Widmark to sign my grapefruit.
I'd like to welcome you all to today's speed dating session.
Many of you have been with us before, many of you are first timers.
So, for the latter group, here are the rules.
Each couple will have one minute to talk and get a sense of the person across from them.
When the bell rings, the women will get up and switch tables.
Men, stay where you are.
This will continue until every woman has met every man and after that, it's up to you.
Are we all ready?
Then let the dating begin.
- I'm Jack.
- Paris.
- Parents travel a lot?
- Why?
- Your name is Paris.
- No.
- Did your parents change flat tires a lot?
- What?
- Or plug the phone into the wall a lot?
- No.
Great.
So we've cleared up that mystery.
What's next on your fascinating list of talking points?
- Uh - what's your major?
- Seriously?
You've got one minute to make an impression and that's all you can come up with?
You want to know my sign, too, Jack?
Or how about my favorite color or if I'm a "Britney" or a "Christina"?
Here, I'll ask you a question.
Was the last time you had an interesting thought when you considered flinging yourself off a building?
Bye, Jack.
I'll write mother immediately.
Paris, and no, my parents didn't travel.
Billy, and I have no idea what that means.
Never mind.
So, what's your story, Billy?
- Well, I'm a drama major...
- Ding, ding, ding!
- Doyle!
- Paris.
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I can say the same for you.
So, you find any good prospects?
- Oh, yes, one girl wants to have eleven children.
- Good God!
The second one was cut off quickly - thank you, by the way -
I believe the words "Latter-Day Saints" were about to come out of her mouth.
I can't believe I came here.
It's my third time.
You ever meet anyone you actually wanted to date?
My bar is so not that high.
I don't see one person in this room that shouldn't be sterilized immediately.
Right there with ya.
So, you've been reading about those skeletons they've been finding on the island of Flores, right?
Oh yeah.
I mean, they're only 13,000 years old.
That's nothing, in geological time.
They made tools, and probably had a language, and...
Keep moving, sister.
You know, they were supposed to be master hunters.
Even though they were diminutive in size.
And then, when that other guy came in in that outfit - how great was that!
We also studied Dylan Thomas today.
Why don't we talk about that for a while?
Yeah.
That was cool, but when Logan and Colin started to fight, that was so amazing.
The teacher had nothing to say, nothing.
He just stood there.
Do you think they'll get in trouble for that?
- Probably not.
- God, that's great!
I mean, you can do anything in college.
No rules, no consequences...
Well, Anna, there are always consequences.
You're getting the wrong idea.
College is not just a crazy, wild, sleep-deprived, hedonistic society.
Oh.
It wasn't the TV.
No.
It wasn't the TV.
This isn't what it looks like.
I hope not.
- I told you it wasn't the TV.
- Hi, Paris.
All right, fine.
Doyle and I had sex.
Okay, Anna, get your coat.
We met at speed dating, and we considered having dinner first, but we both knew where it was going to end up, so we figured we'd just cut to the chase and save the calories.
- Hurry up, Anna.
- Where are we going?
Dinner.
It's only five.
You have no right to be repulsed by my sex life.
This is an exceptionally comfortable robe.
Dinner whenever you want, random sex whenever you want, I can't wait to go to college!
Ice cream and cereal for dinner!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, college rocks.
Ladies!
- Hi, Logan!
- How we doing this fine evening?
- We're doing great, you want to join us?
- Sure.
- So, dull day, uh?
- Not for me.
- Someone's quiet.
- Got nothing to say.
- Do you get the sense that she's mad at me?
- Yep.
Hey, Anna, why don't you head on over to the Fro-Yo social.
You remember where it is, right?
Yeah, but I just had three scoops of ice cream.
Kid, you're in college now, okay?
Now go get yourself some yogurt!
Are you going to come, Logan?
Aw, I'm not sure how well I'll be walking here in a minute, Anna.
Oh!
Okay.
Bye.
That's not a good look.
- I have no words...
- It was just a joke!
Oh, no, wait.
I thought of some.
Jerk!
Ass, arrogant, inconsiderate, mindless, frat-boy, low-life, butt-faced miscreant!
"Butt-faced miscreant"!
Why would you do something like that?
I'm sorry, "butt-faced miscreant"?
Here I am, trying to show Anna what college life is really like, and...
- That is what college life is really like!
- Maybe your college life.
Not mine.
That was my class, Logan.
That was my professor who decides my grades.
- And you made me look ridiculous to him.
- No, I made me look ridiculous to him.
Oh, you don't think he thinks I was a part of it?
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him you were an innocent bystander.
The whole class was in a frenzy the entire time.
We never got back to what we were talking about.
There's another class next week!
Ugh.
I know that classes and the paper and Yale in general mean nothing to you, but it means something to me.
Professor Bell's course is only six weeks long, and you blew one of those weeks for me.
I won't get that week back.
Look, you want up close and personal time with Bell?
My dad knows him.
- He'll arrange...
- Please stop talking.
I'm sorry you're so bent out of shape.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke.
If Anna thinks that Yale is a big joke after spending five minutes with you, then she was always going to think that Yale's just a big joke.
Relax.
You and me?
Very different people.
I have to go.
To the Fro-Yo social.
Yes.
I have to go to the Fro-Yo social.
And yes, I do realize how incredibly stupid that just sounded.
Excuse me.
All I'm saying is, I just want a little information.
Is this a relationship?
A one-night stand?
The beginning of a series of late-night booty calls?
I think I have the right to know.
I hear you.
Doyle, do you hear her?
I do hear her, I just don't understand why we can't decide this amongst ourselves.
Because you can't, Doyle.
Now, please tell Paris how you feel.
- Well, I feel that...
- Speak into the phone, Doyle, I can't hear you.
- Is Anna here?
- No, why?
- She didn't show up at the Fro-Yo social!
- Geez, do you blame her?
- I have to find her.
- Why, did you loan her money or something?
Just go back to what you were doing, please.
Hey, Marty?
Um
- I lost Anna.
I don't know where.
Um - just....
Thanks.
- If she comes back here, call me.
- Go ahead, Doyle.
Tell him.
Any idea where she'd go?
No!
She was supposed to meet me, I can't believe I let her go off by herself.
Well, we'll find her.
- Mom?
- Hi!
Where would a sixteen-year-old girl go for a good time?
Oh, how sad you had to come to me for this conversation.
- Mom...
- You were sixteen a lot more recently than I was.
- I lost Anna.
- How did you lose Anna?
She never showed at the Fro-Yo social!
Okay.
Relax.
Sixteen-year-old girl at college.
You have to check parties.
- Bars and Chinese restaurants rarely card.
- There's no Chinese restaurants around!
- The pub, did you check the pub?
- No.
The pub, we have to check the pub.
Parties and the pub.
- Okay.
Call me when you...
- Ow!
- Uh, I have to go, hon, call me when you find her.
- Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh my God, are you okay?
I smashed my leg on a Thigh Master.
I'm so sorry.
And then I tripped and smashed my other leg on another Thigh Master.
I'm sorry.
Why the hell do you have so many Thigh Masters?
I have a really bad thigh complex.
Are you bleeding?
Do you want to come in?
No, I'm fine, I just...
You left your glasses at my house.
I thought you might need them.
Thank you.
I didn't think you'd be here, I thought you were going to Patty's.
I am.
I was just leaving.
But I don't have to go if you want to come in.
Naw, it's okay.
I'm still going through my, uh, dark day.
I'm going to go.
Okay.
Sorry about your foot.
- What's going on with your garage?
- What?
Your garage door looks all weird.
Oh, no, it's fine, its - jammed.
Leave it.
No, you can't leave it open like that, you could ruin all your stuff.
No, no, no, that's okay
- I have too much stuff anyhow, so if some of it gets ruined, serves me right for being so darn materialistic!
- What are all these trees doing here?
- No, no, no, just stop.
Go back to your dark day.
No, no, don't.
There's clowns in there, and puppies wearing costumes and they'll cheer you up and then your dark day will be ruined...
What is this?
- It's your boat.
- I thought I told her to get rid of this boat.
She did.
She sold it to me, along with all her other crap.
She made quite a killing, actually.
I just couldn't stand the idea that you might regret - someday - giving this boat away.
- Even though I said I wanted it gone.
- Yes, I know, but you were upset.
Oh, I was cranky.
Now I'm upset.
- Sorry.
I just thought...
- You thought about you.
You thought about you and how you'd feel.
You didn't think about me, or the fact that I said I wanted to get rid of this damn boat.
I mean, I said it, Lorelai.
I said it, you heard it, and you ignored it.
- Because I didn't want you...
- You had no respect for what I wanted.
This was my dad.
This was his boat and this decision was mine.
This was not yours.
I know.
This is who I am.
I don't want to hang on to things, or stare at things.
Except my horoscope.
Which was absolutely the wrong thing to bring up right now.
I'm sorry.
I'm getting out of here.
No, I'm sorry.
Please.
Stay and yell at me.
Why, what's the point?
You don't listen to anything I say anyhow.
- She's nowhere.
- She's not nowhere.
This is all my fault.
There's more bars, we'll find her.
God, I'm so stupid.
If I didn't have to confront Logan like that I wouldn't have had to send her off on her own
- and we wouldn't be looking for her right now.
- We'll find her!
He's so frustrating, that guy.
I mean, I don't know what I did to get on his bad side, or why he just has to come after me.
Oh, stop it!
- What?
- He's not coming after you.
He likes you.
- He does not.
- Oh, please, Rory.
Marty, he does not like me.
I mean, look at what he did.
Look at that stunt he pulled.
He totally humiliated me.
Attention like that from people like Logan is like being tapped.
You've been anointed.
You're in.
- In what?
- In with him.
With his group.
He likes you.
Stop being so naive, it's annoying.
Marty...
- Hello?
- Miss Gilmore, Headmaster Charleston here.
Oh.
Hi, Headmaster Charleston.
What's going on?
Well, not much, thank you for asking.
I was just wondering how things are going with Miss Fairchild.
- Oh, Fine.
- Yes?
- Everything's great.
- Wonderful!
Then I can inform Anna's parents that the under-aged girl the Yale campus police found when they broke up a rather raucous Yale party is, in fact, not their daughter.
I'm sorry, Headmaster Charleston.
And what a help that is.
I tried.
I just
- I turned around for a moment.
Did she tell you about the bench?
'Cause I spent a lot of time...
I'm sorry, Miss Gilmore, I have to go.
Some angry parents will be here in a moment to talk to me.
I appreciate the attempt.
Good luck at Yale.
Bye, Headmaster Charleston.
The campus police got her.
She came, she spent one day with me and she got sent home by the police.
I think I'm going to retroactively flunk high school.
At least she's safe, right?
Right.
Crappy, crappy day.
You want to take a cab?
My treat.
Thanks.
I think I'm going to walk.
- Marty...
- I'll
- I'll see you tomorrow.
What are you doing?
I smell like trees.
You do?
Hey!
Me too!
Now we're the crazy pine scented ladies.
How's your punch?
It's good.
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
Just fine.
Thank you!
Thank you, everyone!
I'm honored that you came here to help me celebrate forty wonderful years on the stage.
It feels so good to be here in front of an audience, and so close to a piano!
So close to a piano!
Kirk!
Sorry.
Hey, Patty, why don't you do a little something for us?
Well, if you insist.
Hit it.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
See, there's a reason why I stay away from people on this particular day.
It's 'cause I kind of suck.
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.
I should have listened to you.
I should have stayed out of it.
You were right, I didn't think.
I mean, I didn't think like you would think.
I thought like I would think.
And my thinking is sometimes very, very wrong if you're not me, and occasionally if you are me...
You just keep thinking like you'd think.
I can do that.
Do you want to come in?
You get drunk just standing next to the punch bowl.
No, I'm still kinda...
I get it.
- I just didn't want us to...
- We're not.
- You go have a good time.
- See you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Logan!
Huh?
Richard!
Wow, this is a pleasant surprise!
Finn, Colin, you know Richard, don't you?
Well, hello, boys.
Nice to see you.
Logan, I wanted to talk to you.
I just heard about the incident.
The...?
I heard that you professed your feelings for Rory.
Wha...?
Mr. Bell is a very dear friend of mine, as is the Dean of admissions.
- Well, you know in this place, news travels fast...
- Yeah, look...
I have to tell you that, while I understand what could have driven you to such a public display of affection, there is an appropriate time and place for that sort of thing.
And a classroom in the middle of class is not one of them.
- No, I know, I...
- However, what's done is done.
It's out.
So I dropped by to tell you that I have spoken to your father.
- My father?
- We pounded out a few things.
- Property agreements, pre-nups, that sort of thing.
- Okay, I think that there's been...
Oh, we came to a very fair agreement.
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
Now, we're setting up a dinner for next week to finalize the engagement and start talking about the ceremony.
Emily is handling all the newspaper announcements, so, not to worry.
That's all taken care of.
- But...
- She is a fine young lady, Logan.
I want her to be happy.
You'll take care of that, I assume.
All right, I'll let you get back to your coffee break.
Nice seeing all of you again.
And Logan... welcome to the family, son.
I do hope one of his dopey looking friends knows CPR, or he just might not make it.
You're the best, Grandpa!
All right, who's next?
Paris giving you any trouble?
Not anymore than usual.
However, there is a girl in my modern poetry class who keeps kicking my chair.
Ah, I do love this place.
Right back at you, Grandpa.
Whoa, honey!
Oh, I'm sorry Patty, I didn't see you there!
- Goodness, what's left to wear on your feet?
- I know, it's a sickness.
Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw but actually it came over on the Mayflower.
Oh, well, what a wonderful history lesson.
Any time.
Oh!
What the...
Pasquale's feeling unappreciated again.
We had "Star's Hollow Loves Pasquale Day" last week!
Didn't stick.
Oh, listen, I want to invite you to my anniversary party!
Absolutely!
Which husband?
Oh, no husband, honey, I'm talking about a lover that's been far more loyal and seductive than a husband.
I'm talking about that business we call show!
- Forty years!
- No!
Forty years ago today, I did my first play, off Broadway.
- Off Broadway?
- Cleveland.
That is off Broadway.
Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party.
Food, booze, a little song, a little dance, a little salsa down your pants.
- Well, count me and my pants in.
- Oh!
Wonderful!
I will even drag Luke there.
So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.
Oh, Luke won't come.
Sure he will, I have very effective methods of persuasion.
They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.
No, honey, the party's on Tuesday, the 30th.
- So?
- So, the 30th is the "dark day".
- What dark day?
- Luke's "dark day".
The day that he disappears.
Disappears?
Where?
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows where he goes or what he does, all we know is not to try and find him.
Why didn't I know about this?
I don't know, honey, everyone else does.
Anyhow, you come yourself, okay?
Eight o'clock!
I'll be there.
See you Tuesday, Patty.
Ah!
Pasquale, the Maestro!
My God, you look virile today.
Are you sure your wife won't share you?
Oh, she's good.
I don't agree.
You're living in a fantasy world.
I have classes all day long.
I hear you protesting.
I've got a double major of poli-sci and bio-chem, Terrence!
I see you over-scheduling.
Sorry, I'm just getting a water here.
Paris, you're not yelling at me, you're yelling at the world.
I'm not yelling at all.
This is the natural register of my voice.
It's the register of a timid little girl who is not putting herself out there.
I am putting myself out there!
Why are you arguing with Terrence?
Why?
Look.
I know I haven't dated lately, but Asher was very important to me.
Hey Paris, I can't find my notebook?
The black one with all the yellow notes in it.
You have not put yourself out there.
He just died.
Oh, for God's sake, he was halfway dead when you met him.
Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?
Out where?
Out in the world.
Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?
You don't just meet people!
It doesn't happen.
Um, I'll just go in my room now.
Look at your dream log, you are months behind.
And your pretty thoughts journal.
Okay, fine.
I have neglected thinking pretty.
But I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost while you were in court ordered rehab!
Hey Paris, what's this?
I had a back problem.
The prescription was at home in my File-o-fax.
This is a message from Headmaster Charleston.
When did Headmaster Charleston call?
- Earlier.
- And you didn't tell me?
I'm in session.
Hello, Headmaster Charleston, this is Rory Gilmore.
I'm sorry it took so long to call you back, I just got your message.
Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive.
We should talk later.
So, um, how are you?
I'm very well.
How are you enjoying Yale?
I love it!
Is it everything you thought it would be?
It's nothing like I thought it would be, it's better actually.
I have no doubt.
Now, I'm calling because we often ask a former Chilton student to host a prospective Yale student for a couple of days.
Show them around, let them observe classes, campus life, that sort of thing.
I was wondering if you'd be interested.
- Me?
- Yes, this is a very special young lady.
Bright, focused, quietly determined.
She reminds me a great deal of you.
- Thank you.
- I assume you haven't changed.
Well, I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit, but I'm basically still me.
Excellent.
Then I hope you'll consider accepting.
I know your workload must be substantial.
- That's okay.
I can handle it.
- So I can take that as a yes?
Yes.
Take it as a yes.
And thank you, I'm honored.
Her name is Anna Fairchild.
She's sixteen years old and she'll be arriving Monday morning at nine o'clock.
- Does that work for you?
- That works perfectly.
Very well, it's a date.
I'm very glad to talk to you again, Miss Gilmore.
Yale certainly sounds like it's agreeing with you.
I hope it will also agree with Miss Fairchild.
- Like Sabrina!
- I beg your pardon?
Sabrina Fairchild, that was her name.
Have we segued into discussing a movie?
And we can segue right out again.
I'm very grateful for that.
All right then, my office will be contacting you with the particulars.
I hope you have a wonderful time.
I'm sure Miss Fairchild will.
Thank you, Headmaster Charleston, I won't let you down.
What I nice thing to hear.
I'm sure we'll be talking soon.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Well this is a very big honor, you know.
- Oh, I know.
Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale, they're asking you.
I know!
I know.
Well, have you thought about what kinds of things you'd like to show her?
Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course.
And then I thought she'd got to the paper with me and then I thought maybe a trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library.
Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.
- Steve?
- Bible.
R ight.
Then I was torn between taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle or the Science Center and gymnasium.
Huh.
That is a conundrum.
Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then, you'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.
Lorelai, these things are of great interest to any young person considering attending Yale.
Oh, I am sure.
I, personally, would enjoy every single thing on my list.
Yes, I know.
But it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in.
I'm not talking a kegger, but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling "Give me a location" or something like that.
- You know, your mother may be right.
- Who heard that?
Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience.
It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun, too.
Oh, have her touch the toe!
- Yeah!
- Touch the toe?
The toe!
The statue of Theodore Woolsey.
It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet.
And for that reason he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.
Wow, that is fun!
Make sure you get a parent consent form for that one.
Oh, it is so exciting watching you at Yale.
Such a wonderful time for me.
The people that you meet there will stay with you for the rest of your life, mark my words.
Tell me, are you making good friends?
Yeah, I have some good friends.
And what about Mr. Huntzberger?
Who's Mr. Huntzberger?
Um, Logan Huntzberger's a boy I go to school with.
A fine boy, from a fine family.
- You know him?
- His parents are very good friends of ours.
Oh, you know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai!
No.
He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.
No.
His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.
Oh!
...
No.
Well, Logan is their son.
And I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night?
The other night?
He's very nice, Grandpa.
I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.
Uh, was this Logan at the "Male Yale" party you threw?
He's the one who gave me a ride home, Mom.
Oh, Limo boy.
Swell.
He's also on the paper with me.
You know, his father owns some of the finest papers in the country.
- I know.
- Not a bad connection, huh?
Nope, not a bad connection at all.
- Hey!
So tell me about this Logan.
- It's three degrees out here.
Uh, as of tonight my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do.
That's not right or fair.
He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do.
For him the dish is always half empty.
You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?
What is the deal with this guy?
Are you dating?
No, we're not dating!
He's just a friend.
How close?
For example, if we freeze to death will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?
I know him from school, he's just a casual friend, that's it.
- Do you think he's cute?
- What does it matter if I think he's cute?
Uh, it matters to me.
I don't want ugly grandchildren.
Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone.
Since Dean, I'm taking a boy break, okay?
- I'm just concentrating on school, that's it.
- Fine.
If that changes?
- You'll be the first to know.
- 'Kay.
Thank you.
- 'Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father.
- I know.
Info on you and looking better in chiffon, that's about it.
Oh, and my pole-dance is way hotter.
- I'm frozen now.
- Okay.
Let's go.
In my hand, ladies and gentlemen, sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner.
I am never more than ten feet away from pie.
Ah, see, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.
Oh, it's heaven!
One quick trip downstairs and I have all the treats I want.
- You're like Willy Wonka but hotter.
- I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.
Slap on a purple top hat and you're close.
This is nice.
I think it's going very well, you and me.
You think it's going very well?
I have very few complaints.
Hmm.
I'm going right past the very few complaints comment, 'cause I know you're just trying to bait me.
What complaints?
Hey, so Luke?
Miss Patty is celebrating her forty year anniversary.
Which husband?
With the business we call show.
Oh, him.
And she's having a big party and I told her we'd go.
Oh, man.
It'll be fun.
It will not be fun.
She'll be wearing tap shoes, and there'll be songs and punch and at least one story about Milton Berle's penis.
- Only one?
- Come on!
I have to have you there.
- Otherwise people will think I made you up.
- Fine.
I'll go.
Thank you.
Okay, so it's Tuesday at eight o'clock.
I can't go Tuesday.
- Why not?
- I have to go out of town.
- Why?
- Business.
Business?
Now you're Willy Loman?
Banking business in Woodbury, standing appointment.
Sorry.
Hit the light, will you?
I have to get up early. 'Night.
Okay. 'Night.
Wait till you see all the stuff I got for Anna.
Yale tee-shirt.
Bulldogs sweatshirt.
Yale baseball cap.
Visor.
Coffee mug.
I told you to open a window when you're hot gluing in here.
It's freezing outside.
Oh, wait.
This is new, they just came out with this.
The Yale soda cozy.
How cute is that?
I can't believe you.
You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore, and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know?
I'm trying to make her feel welcome.
Oh, she'll feel welcome.
They all feel welcome.
- Who's "they"?
- The enemy.
Who's the enemy?
Any girl under the age of seventeen is the enemy.
- Okay, I'm opening a window now.
- They're coming for everything.
They're going to take our jobs, our thunder, our starter husbands.
- Don't you have a class to get to?
- They're coming, Rory.
They're coming, and they are going to keep on coming.
Like the locusts descending on Mankato.
We'll be beating them off for the rest of our lives.
Please don't be here when she arrives, I don't want you to scare her off.
Me?
Scare her off?
Please.
She's the one with the alabaster skin and the perky breasts.
Do not say "perky breasts" to her, do you understand me?
Eve Harrington has arrived.
Hi.
I'm looking for Rory Gilmore?
- I'm Rory, you must be Anna.
- Yes.
Great, come in.
You find it okay?
I got lost a couple of times, but people were really nice and got me here.
Yeah, it's a friendly world out there, isn't it?
Anna, this is my roommate Paris, and I'm sorry.
For what?
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Okay, let me show you around the place.
That is Paris' room.
Don't go in.
That is my room, and this is the common room which is also your bedroom.
Bathroom is literally outside the door.
And there's a fridge, with water or soda or whatever you want - oh!
And I got you some welcome to Yale gifts!
Oh!
Really?
Thank you.
I'm really glad you're here.
You are going to love Yale, it's an amazing place.
I mean, I was excited when I first started here, but every day is different and better.
You have no idea how much there is to learn.
It's - oh, well, you'll see.
Okay.
I actually snagged us some caviar.
They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos and achieve a very similar result.
Hey.
- This is Anna.
- Did Paris move?
- I'm right here, Marty.
- I know, Paris.
Anna is from Chilton, my alma mater, and I'm showing her around Yale for a couple days.
Oh, cool.
I'll put this in the fridge.
In my room.
Thanks!
Okay, you ready?
I'm ready.
You have boys bringing you food?
Yale is a magical place, Anna.
A magical, magical place.
The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the old campus, and it houses most of the undergraduate freshman class.
It was begun be Theodore Dwight Woolsey, president of Yale from 1846 to 1871.
Over here is the Elihu Yale bench.
Now, Eli Yale was an officer in the British East Indian Company.
He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds and 417 books and a portrait of King George the first.
And so it was renamed in his honor.
He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school but Yale College never recieved it because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existing Collegiate School, apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him.
Oh, wait.
This is the wrong bench.
So keep the story, but cross out the diagram.
Moving on.
There's actually an ongoing rumor that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
Imagine all the tables you could wait with those skills, huh?
Okay.
You are about to get a first-hand feel of what it's like to work on a real newspaper.
Now be prepared.
It is an extremely hectic, fast-paced environment.
Don't get intimidated and don't get in the way.
Ready?
Here it is.
Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something.
But you just wait.
It can heat up in a second, and when it does, man, watch out.
My desk is over here.
I do not care!
Hey!
I am your editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me!
I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.
You will if you want to stay on this newspaper!
Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalistic dilemmas between reporter and editor - the right to protect sources.
Damn it, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now!
The pen fairy.
That is one of my personal fine point gel tipped pens from my bottom right hand drawer.
And you went into that drawer and you took that pen and it's mine!
Okay.
For "fine point gel tips" substitute "confidential source deep within the administration".
Huh?
You get a little thrill, don't you?
Hang on a sec.
Hey.
Question.
Have you ever heard anything about Luke's "dark day"?
His what?
Well, one day a year he apparently has a "dark day".
No one knows where he goes or what he does, he just disappears.
I've heard nothing about this.
Okay, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?
How am I supposed to know?
Because, you keep all those crazy anal Bob Graham kind of notebooks.
"Eight a.m., got up.
Eight fifteen, brushed teeth.
Eight twenty-five, had impure thoughts.
Eight thirty-six, sent dwarves off to work."
I do not have my diaries from last November on me at the moment.
- But you do have them.
- Yes.
And they will contain where we ate breakfast that morning.
- Yes.
- I love my little circus freak.
- I call you later.
- Hey, did your Mini-Me show up?
Yeah, her name's Anna.
She's right here.
- Oh, how's the tour going?
- It's going great.
How many boring bench lectures did you give?
Two.
But they were about the same bench.
Oh, you know what?
I have someone standing abnormally close to me right now.
I'll call you later?
Okay, say hi to Kirk for me.
'Kay, bye.
Kirk!
What can I do for you?
- I have a business proposition for you.
- Okay.
- How often do you slip in your tub?
- Never.
- Okay, it doesn't work if you answer like that, so...
- Constantly.
I never stop slipping even when I get out.
I thought so.
Then my new line of bath and shower adhesive decals are for you.
Huh. "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
Yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
Well, Kirk this looks very impressive.
And wow, very expensive.
Well, it's yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
Hmm.
Well, why don't you leave the catalogue with me and I'll look it over?
- Could you look at it now?
It's the only one I have.
- Okay.
I like that one.
If you put the fishes' faces together it looks like they're kissing.
Oh, hey, Kirk.
Do you know anything about Luke's dark day?
Everyone knows about Luke's dark day.
Do you know what it is?
Not the details, just that he has it once a year.
I think it goes back a long, long time.
Yeah?
Sure, I mean, Luke's always had a touch of darkness in him.
I guess we all do, but Luke's a little more touched than some.
He's kind of grabbed, actually.
What do you think it's about?
When I was in seventh grade, Luke knocked the books out of my hands.
Because of his dark day?
No, everyone knocked my books out of my hands.
I was kind of a target.
I used to wear a cape to school.
Now, outside, we just passed the women's table, which was designed by Maya Lin.
She's also the one who designed the Vietnam War memorial, which, by the way, originally was a class project for which she received a 'B'.
The teacher who gave the 'B' also submitted a design for the war memorial, but hers was chosen.
His was not.
That's a life lesson to remember.
This is Sterling Memorial Library.
One of my favorite places on campus.
It was built in 1930 and it houses over one third of the University's ten million volumes.
I love libraries.
I just spend I can't tell you how many hours just - you're not writing.
Oh.
Sorry.
- I come here sometimes late at night...
- I just love how everybody's dressed.
- What?
- No uniforms.
I love that there's no uniforms.
College, to me, means no more uniforms.
Oh, right.
However, wait till you're late for class and it takes you twenty minutes to put together an outfit.
Suddenly you'll miss those uniforms.
How many guys have you dated since you've been here?
Oh, well, none from Yale.
Anyhow, the books - are you seeing the books?
Everything you'd want to read is right here.
Feel it.
Feels good, right?
Now smell it.
Nothing, nothing smells like that.
I'm sorry, excuse me - did I just see you smell that book?
- Hey, Logan.
- Hey, Ace.
Who's your friend?
Oh, Anna, this is Logan.
Logan, this is Anna, she's from my high school.
- I'm showing her around campus.
- Hi.
High school?
Naw, I woulda sworn you were a college girl.
- So is she showing you a good time?
- I'm showing her everything important.
Mmm.
Good.
Make sure she takes you by the pub.
Local place, everyone goes there.
- I'm not taking her to the pub.
- Oh, please?
The pub sounds fun.
You don't have to drink, they do have coffee.
It's a cool scene, make her take you.
Bring a book to sniff!
- What are you doing in a library anyhow?
- Got lost.
Don't tell anyone I was here, ruin my rep.
Anna, it's been a pleasure.
See you, Ace.
He's cute.
Yes, he is.
But not as cute as Pushkin.
Right this way, missy.
I'm not being mean, I'm just
- Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Well I'm sorry you're so upset!
Well, you're giving me a week's notice!
What am I supposed to do with a week's notice?
Well my son just called me from Florida, telling me about the condo, Luke!
Okay fine, go!
And enjoy Florida, I hear they have great weather there.
Terrific hurricanes!
Make sure you bring plenty of plywood and bottled water!
- Hey, hi, hello!
- What are you doing here?
I was just driving down the street and I saw you guys, thought I'd stop by and say hey, hi, hello.
- Hello Mrs. Thompson.
- Hello, dear.
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing.
Nothing's going on.
Luke, please understand there's nothing I can do!
I've already found someone else to rent the house and they have cars!
- And you just agreed to that!
- Well, it seemed rather reasonable to me!
- Oh, come on!
- Um...
- Luke's very upset with me.
- Why?
Well, his father rented the garage, he was building a boat and he didn't have room at his place, so he paid me to do it here.
And then when he died, Luke continued to pay me for the garage, and now I'm moving to a nursing home and I need him to move his boat!
You're mad because this little old lady is moving to a nursing home and you have to move your boat.
Is this really the story you want to stick to?
She called me out of the blue, and I've paid for an entire month.
I can give you a partial refund if you like.
Where am I supposed to find a space to store a boat on a moment's notice?
Huh?
Did you think about that for even a second?
Could we sit down?
The doctor says the screw in my hip is loose.
Yes, yes, let's sit and calmly try to figure this out.
No, no, I've got it figured out.
Just haul it off!
Trash it!
- Haul what off?
- The boat?
Yes, the boat.
Scrap it.
Find somebody to drag it away and cut it up for firewood!
- Oh, now Luke...
- Who's going to haul it off?
Anyone.
Just find a guy with a truck and a hook.
Strap it on and drive it away and send me the bill.
I'm done!
Luke - we'll be right back.
Luke, stop!
What, what and what?
I have paid that woman every month for fifteen years!
Luke, she's moving to a nursing home!
And my dad was paying her every month for twenty years before that!
- Nursing home, Luke!
- I know where she's going!
- She's not trying to hurt you.
- Whatever.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back to the diner.
- Let me drive you.
- No.
Look, I can drive you back to the diner.
I promise if we pass any senior citizens I'll let you jump out and pants them.
Fine.
And here we have the world famous Luke's diner, home of the best coffee on the east coast and the most delightful and chatty proprietor since Mel kissed Flo's grits.
Okay, well, I should get back to the Inn.
I hope you've enjoyed your tour and don't forget to buy yourself a souvenir plastic monkey on the way out.
Tomorrow's the anniversary of my dad's death.
Oh - oh, hon...
And every year on that anniversary...
I disappear.
I don't work.
I don't talk to anyone.
I get in kind of a funk - it's like... um...
- You have a "dark day".
- Yeah.
I have a dark day.
I thought I should tell you this because we're in a relationship, and I thought you might wonder why I suddenly don't answer the phone, or I'm not around.
Why you can't flip your hair and con me into going to Miss Patty's crazy anniversary party.
The hair flip is that effective, huh?
Combine that with your black dress, you could probably get me to be your backup dancer.
I'll remember that.
I've never told anyone this before.
I don't really like to talk about it.
I guess that explains the thing with Mrs. Thompson.
Yeah.
Some timing, her springing this boat thing on me now.
I'll apologize to her.
You know, I never finished that boat.
It's been sitting there half done for fifteen years.
Hey, Luke, don't you think you might have been a little hasty about the boat decision?
I mean, you were upset, and I bet some day you're going to be really sorry you don't have that boat anymore.
No, it's better she gets rid of the thing now.
But...
I haven't even looked at that boat since my dad got sick.
Not a glance, nothing.
Even more reason.
If it's gone, then I don't have to deal with it.
It's time to move on, you know?
- But...
- I'm fine.
Really.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Any time.
- I love it here!
- You love it here?
We just walked in!
I know, but it feels so collegiate!
Actually, you know what is great about this place?
Eli Yale drank here?
No, they make amazing cappuccinos.
You want one?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You go sit and I'll get the coffees.
- Two cappuccinos, please.
- Sure thing.
- Hey.
- Hi, you just get here?
Yep.
- You want a...
- Yes, please.
I'm sorry, could you make that three cappuccinos?
- So how's it going?
- I think I may have overwhelmed Anna.
Her hand cramped up about an hour ago, and it's been smasming ever since.
- Really?
Where is she?
- She's right there...
I turn around for one minute.
Excuse me.
Rory, Mark and Matthew were just telling me about a great party tonight.
Really, well that was very nice of them.
Thank you, Matthew and Mark, was it?
- That's right.
- Well, how biblical.
Okay, well, our schedule is completely full at the moment, but if that changes - if things lighten up, or if she suddenly ages two years in the next three hours, then we'll know where to find you.
Okay?
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
We'll be over here, just in case.
- Rory!
- Anna!
Well this is so not fair.
You get to talk to boys.
- What?
- Well, you were over there talking to Marty.
That's different.
Marty's just a friend.
Which is another great thing about college.
You learn to have guy friends.
Nothing romantic, just a good pal.
Those boys are not interested in your friendship, unless the word "friendship" is tattooed on your butt.
Now drink your coffee.
It's good, huh?
Can I sleep with the TV on?
Um, yeah, as long as you don't wake Paris up, and that advice is for your own good.
- And if I can't go to sleep?
- Then you don't go to sleep.
I love that!
I love not having someone to tell me when to go to sleep.
Yes, it's great.
I love sleeping with the TV on, and I love having no parents around, and I love cappuccino, and I love apple muffins, and I love college!
What's she on?
Four cappuccinos and three Red Bulls from the fridge.
Enjoy your night.
How do I look?
- Where are you going?
- I'm putting myself out there, Rory.
- Now?
- Yes now.
It's eleven o'clock at night, who are you hoping to hook up with now, Spike and Drusilla?
Just tell me if my lipstick is too whorish.
Nope, just whorish enough.
Going out at eleven o'clock at night?
I love college!
I may suffocate her when I get back.
Hey, if you can catch her.
- Bye.
- Good luck.
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.
Which brings us to this question.
Does Campbell's work successfully resolve the disparate stances of Jung and Freud when it comes to the collective unconscious?
...
Hey, pay attention.
Professor Bell is one of the foremost philosophy professors in the country.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- ... archetypes bordering on metaphysical?
All right.
Let's call that close enough.
But now, Camel can point to the repetition of the hero myth in culture after culture and say, "Hey Sigmund!
Like it or not, here are the same basic characters over and over"...
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I'm right in the middle of a class, young man.
I know, I'm sorry.
Rory, you can't just walk out like that.
Not after everything we've been through.
You just left.
I was still in bed, I mean, what is that all about?
- Okay, you need to do this later.
- I can't do this later.
Rory, I love you.
I love you, damn it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
God, just talk to me!
- Okay, out!
Right now, just get...
- Colin!
What are you doing, man?
- Get the hell out of here!
- She's with me now, I told you that.
Let it go.
I will not let it go!
She doesn't love you, Rory, tell him you don't love him!
- Everything was fine until you came along!
- Don't blame me 'cause you couldn't keep her!
- I swear to God, I'm going to kill you.
- Oh, I'd love to see you try.
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
Anthony, get security!
Stop - break it up!
What are you - gentlemen!
You are losing control!
You are in a classroom, stop it!
All right, that's enough, break it up, you two!
Rory Gilmore, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Toying with these boys like this.
They used to have pride.
They used to have dignity.
They used to have balls.
Damn it Gilmore, give 'em back their balls!
- God, this is a lot of junk.
- I know.
I mean, who has three Thigh Masters, besides Suzanne Somers.
Well, Mrs. Thompson, apparently.
You'd think if she had three Thigh Masters she'd wear some slacks once in a while.
And, I'm sorry, why exactly did you have to take all this crap?
It was the only way I could get her to give me the boat.
Some guy wanted it, and she got him to buy all her other crap, so if I wanted the boat I had to take everything, and that's what I did.
I just have to hide it for a few days, then I'll move it.
Where?
I don't know.
Somewhere.
The Inn!
I'll put it in the old stable out back.
- Are you ever going to tell Luke?
- Yes!
- Oh, when?
- A week, a year
- I haven't thought that far in advance.
I just couldn't let her get rid of his dad's boat!
What if we hang the Thigh Masters on it?
- Or get more trees!
- Yeah, or get more trees!
- Jackson's got some trees at home.
- Think I could borrow them?
Sure!
We'll just wait 'till he lies down for his nap and sneak them right out of there.
Great.
Then I'll hop a fence and get Richard Widmark to sign my grapefruit.
I'd like to welcome you all to today's speed dating session.
Many of you have been with us before, many of you are first timers.
So, for the latter group, here are the rules.
Each couple will have one minute to talk and get a sense of the person across from them.
When the bell rings, the women will get up and switch tables.
Men, stay where you are.
This will continue until every woman has met every man and after that, it's up to you.
Are we all ready?
Then let the dating begin.
- I'm Jack.
- Paris.
- Parents travel a lot?
- Why?
- Your name is Paris.
- No.
- Did your parents change flat tires a lot?
- What?
- Or plug the phone into the wall a lot?
- No.
Great.
So we've cleared up that mystery.
What's next on your fascinating list of talking points?
- Uh - what's your major?
- Seriously?
You've got one minute to make an impression and that's all you can come up with?
You want to know my sign, too, Jack?
Or how about my favorite color or if I'm a "Britney" or a "Christina"?
Here, I'll ask you a question.
Was the last time you had an interesting thought when you considered flinging yourself off a building?
Bye, Jack.
I'll write mother immediately.
Paris, and no, my parents didn't travel.
Billy, and I have no idea what that means.
Never mind.
So, what's your story, Billy?
- Well, I'm a drama major...
- Ding, ding, ding!
- Doyle!
- Paris.
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I can say the same for you.
So, you find any good prospects?
- Oh, yes, one girl wants to have eleven children.
- Good God!
The second one was cut off quickly - thank you, by the way -
I believe the words "Latter-Day Saints" were about to come out of her mouth.
I can't believe I came here.
It's my third time.
You ever meet anyone you actually wanted to date?
My bar is so not that high.
I don't see one person in this room that shouldn't be sterilized immediately.
Right there with ya.
So, you've been reading about those skeletons they've been finding on the island of Flores, right?
Oh yeah.
I mean, they're only 13,000 years old.
That's nothing, in geological time.
They made tools, and probably had a language, and...
Keep moving, sister.
You know, they were supposed to be master hunters.
Even though they were diminutive in size.
And then, when that other guy came in in that outfit - how great was that!
We also studied Dylan Thomas today.
Why don't we talk about that for a while?
Yeah.
That was cool, but when Logan and Colin started to fight, that was so amazing.
The teacher had nothing to say, nothing.
He just stood there.
Do you think they'll get in trouble for that?
- Probably not.
- God, that's great!
I mean, you can do anything in college.
No rules, no consequences...
Well, Anna, there are always consequences.
You're getting the wrong idea.
College is not just a crazy, wild, sleep-deprived, hedonistic society.
Oh.
It wasn't the TV.
No.
It wasn't the TV.
This isn't what it looks like.
I hope not.
- I told you it wasn't the TV.
- Hi, Paris.
All right, fine.
Doyle and I had sex.
Okay, Anna, get your coat.
We met at speed dating, and we considered having dinner first, but we both knew where it was going to end up, so we figured we'd just cut to the chase and save the calories.
- Hurry up, Anna.
- Where are we going?
Dinner.
It's only five.
You have no right to be repulsed by my sex life.
This is an exceptionally comfortable robe.
Dinner whenever you want, random sex whenever you want, I can't wait to go to college!
Ice cream and cereal for dinner!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, college rocks.
Ladies!
- Hi, Logan!
- How we doing this fine evening?
- We're doing great, you want to join us?
- Sure.
- So, dull day, uh?
- Not for me.
- Someone's quiet.
- Got nothing to say.
- Do you get the sense that she's mad at me?
- Yep.
Hey, Anna, why don't you head on over to the Fro-Yo social.
You remember where it is, right?
Yeah, but I just had three scoops of ice cream.
Kid, you're in college now, okay?
Now go get yourself some yogurt!
Are you going to come, Logan?
Aw, I'm not sure how well I'll be walking here in a minute, Anna.
Oh!
Okay.
Bye.
That's not a good look.
- I have no words...
- It was just a joke!
Oh, no, wait.
I thought of some.
Jerk!
Ass, arrogant, inconsiderate, mindless, frat-boy, low-life, butt-faced miscreant!
"Butt-faced miscreant"!
Why would you do something like that?
I'm sorry, "butt-faced miscreant"?
Here I am, trying to show Anna what college life is really like, and...
- That is what college life is really like!
- Maybe your college life.
Not mine.
That was my class, Logan.
That was my professor who decides my grades.
- And you made me look ridiculous to him.
- No, I made me look ridiculous to him.
Oh, you don't think he thinks I was a part of it?
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him you were an innocent bystander.
The whole class was in a frenzy the entire time.
We never got back to what we were talking about.
There's another class next week!
Ugh.
I know that classes and the paper and Yale in general mean nothing to you, but it means something to me.
Professor Bell's course is only six weeks long, and you blew one of those weeks for me.
I won't get that week back.
Look, you want up close and personal time with Bell?
My dad knows him.
- He'll arrange...
- Please stop talking.
I'm sorry you're so bent out of shape.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke.
If Anna thinks that Yale is a big joke after spending five minutes with you, then she was always going to think that Yale's just a big joke.
Relax.
You and me?
Very different people.
I have to go.
To the Fro-Yo social.
Yes.
I have to go to the Fro-Yo social.
And yes, I do realize how incredibly stupid that just sounded.
Excuse me.
All I'm saying is, I just want a little information.
Is this a relationship?
A one-night stand?
The beginning of a series of late-night booty calls?
I think I have the right to know.
I hear you.
Doyle, do you hear her?
I do hear her, I just don't understand why we can't decide this amongst ourselves.
Because you can't, Doyle.
Now, please tell Paris how you feel.
- Well, I feel that...
- Speak into the phone, Doyle, I can't hear you.
- Is Anna here?
- No, why?
- She didn't show up at the Fro-Yo social!
- Geez, do you blame her?
- I have to find her.
- Why, did you loan her money or something?
Just go back to what you were doing, please.
Hey, Marty?
Um
- I lost Anna.
I don't know where.
Um - just....
Thanks.
- If she comes back here, call me.
- Go ahead, Doyle.
Tell him.
Any idea where she'd go?
No!
She was supposed to meet me, I can't believe I let her go off by herself.
Well, we'll find her.
- Mom?
- Hi!
Where would a sixteen-year-old girl go for a good time?
Oh, how sad you had to come to me for this conversation.
- Mom...
- You were sixteen a lot more recently than I was.
- I lost Anna.
- How did you lose Anna?
She never showed at the Fro-Yo social!
Okay.
Relax.
Sixteen-year-old girl at college.
You have to check parties.
- Bars and Chinese restaurants rarely card.
- There's no Chinese restaurants around!
- The pub, did you check the pub?
- No.
The pub, we have to check the pub.
Parties and the pub.
- Okay.
Call me when you...
- Ow!
- Uh, I have to go, hon, call me when you find her.
- Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh my God, are you okay?
I smashed my leg on a Thigh Master.
I'm so sorry.
And then I tripped and smashed my other leg on another Thigh Master.
I'm sorry.
Why the hell do you have so many Thigh Masters?
I have a really bad thigh complex.
Are you bleeding?
Do you want to come in?
No, I'm fine, I just...
You left your glasses at my house.
I thought you might need them.
Thank you.
I didn't think you'd be here, I thought you were going to Patty's.
I am.
I was just leaving.
But I don't have to go if you want to come in.
Naw, it's okay.
I'm still going through my, uh, dark day.
I'm going to go.
Okay.
Sorry about your foot.
- What's going on with your garage?
- What?
Your garage door looks all weird.
Oh, no, it's fine, its - jammed.
Leave it.
No, you can't leave it open like that, you could ruin all your stuff.
No, no, no, that's okay
- I have too much stuff anyhow, so if some of it gets ruined, serves me right for being so darn materialistic!
- What are all these trees doing here?
- No, no, no, just stop.
Go back to your dark day.
No, no, don't.
There's clowns in there, and puppies wearing costumes and they'll cheer you up and then your dark day will be ruined...
What is this?
- It's your boat.
- I thought I told her to get rid of this boat.
She did.
She sold it to me, along with all her other crap.
She made quite a killing, actually.
I just couldn't stand the idea that you might regret - someday - giving this boat away.
- Even though I said I wanted it gone.
- Yes, I know, but you were upset.
Oh, I was cranky.
Now I'm upset.
- Sorry.
I just thought...
- You thought about you.
You thought about you and how you'd feel.
You didn't think about me, or the fact that I said I wanted to get rid of this damn boat.
I mean, I said it, Lorelai.
I said it, you heard it, and you ignored it.
- Because I didn't want you...
- You had no respect for what I wanted.
This was my dad.
This was his boat and this decision was mine.
This was not yours.
I know.
This is who I am.
I don't want to hang on to things, or stare at things.
Except my horoscope.
Which was absolutely the wrong thing to bring up right now.
I'm sorry.
I'm getting out of here.
No, I'm sorry.
Please.
Stay and yell at me.
Why, what's the point?
You don't listen to anything I say anyhow.
- She's nowhere.
- She's not nowhere.
This is all my fault.
There's more bars, we'll find her.
God, I'm so stupid.
If I didn't have to confront Logan like that I wouldn't have had to send her off on her own
- and we wouldn't be looking for her right now.
- We'll find her!
He's so frustrating, that guy.
I mean, I don't know what I did to get on his bad side, or why he just has to come after me.
Oh, stop it!
- What?
- He's not coming after you.
He likes you.
- He does not.
- Oh, please, Rory.
Marty, he does not like me.
I mean, look at what he did.
Look at that stunt he pulled.
He totally humiliated me.
Attention like that from people like Logan is like being tapped.
You've been anointed.
You're in.
- In what?
- In with him.
With his group.
He likes you.
Stop being so naive, it's annoying.
Marty...
- Hello?
- Miss Gilmore, Headmaster Charleston here.
Oh.
Hi, Headmaster Charleston.
What's going on?
Well, not much, thank you for asking.
I was just wondering how things are going with Miss Fairchild.
- Oh, Fine.
- Yes?
- Everything's great.
- Wonderful!
Then I can inform Anna's parents that the under-aged girl the Yale campus police found when they broke up a rather raucous Yale party is, in fact, not their daughter.
I'm sorry, Headmaster Charleston.
And what a help that is.
I tried.
I just
- I turned around for a moment.
Did she tell you about the bench?
'Cause I spent a lot of time...
I'm sorry, Miss Gilmore, I have to go.
Some angry parents will be here in a moment to talk to me.
I appreciate the attempt.
Good luck at Yale.
Bye, Headmaster Charleston.
The campus police got her.
She came, she spent one day with me and she got sent home by the police.
I think I'm going to retroactively flunk high school.
At least she's safe, right?
Right.
Crappy, crappy day.
You want to take a cab?
My treat.
Thanks.
I think I'm going to walk.
- Marty...
- I'll
- I'll see you tomorrow.
What are you doing?
I smell like trees.
You do?
Hey!
Me too!
Now we're the crazy pine scented ladies.
How's your punch?
It's good.
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
Just fine.
Thank you!
Thank you, everyone!
I'm honored that you came here to help me celebrate forty wonderful years on the stage.
It feels so good to be here in front of an audience, and so close to a piano!
So close to a piano!
Kirk!
Sorry.
Hey, Patty, why don't you do a little something for us?
Well, if you insist.
Hit it.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
See, there's a reason why I stay away from people on this particular day.
It's 'cause I kind of suck.
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.
I should have listened to you.
I should have stayed out of it.
You were right, I didn't think.
I mean, I didn't think like you would think.
I thought like I would think.
And my thinking is sometimes very, very wrong if you're not me, and occasionally if you are me...
You just keep thinking like you'd think.
I can do that.
Do you want to come in?
You get drunk just standing next to the punch bowl.
No, I'm still kinda...
I get it.
- I just didn't want us to...
- We're not.
- You go have a good time.
- See you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Logan!
Huh?
Richard!
Wow, this is a pleasant surprise!
Finn, Colin, you know Richard, don't you?
Well, hello, boys.
Nice to see you.
Logan, I wanted to talk to you.
I just heard about the incident.
The...?
I heard that you professed your feelings for Rory.
Wha...?
Mr. Bell is a very dear friend of mine, as is the Dean of admissions.
- Well, you know in this place, news travels fast...
- Yeah, look...
I have to tell you that, while I understand what could have driven you to such a public display of affection, there is an appropriate time and place for that sort of thing.
And a classroom in the middle of class is not one of them.
- No, I know, I...
- However, what's done is done.
It's out.
So I dropped by to tell you that I have spoken to your father.
- My father?
- We pounded out a few things.
- Property agreements, pre-nups, that sort of thing.
- Okay, I think that there's been...
Oh, we came to a very fair agreement.
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
Now, we're setting up a dinner for next week to finalize the engagement and start talking about the ceremony.
Emily is handling all the newspaper announcements, so, not to worry.
That's all taken care of.
- But...
- She is a fine young lady, Logan.
I want her to be happy.
You'll take care of that, I assume.
All right, I'll let you get back to your coffee break.
Nice seeing all of you again.
And Logan... welcome to the family, son.
I do hope one of his dopey looking friends knows CPR, or he just might not make it.
You're the best, Grandpa!
All right, who's next?
Paris giving you any trouble?
Not anymore than usual.
However, there is a girl in my modern poetry class who keeps kicking my chair.
Ah, I do love this place.
Right back at you, Grandpa.
Whoa, honey!
Oh, I'm sorry Patty, I didn't see you there!
- Goodness, what's left to wear on your feet?
- I know, it's a sickness.
Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw but actually it came over on the Mayflower.
Oh, well, what a wonderful history lesson.
Any time.
Oh!
What the...
Pasquale's feeling unappreciated again.
We had "Star's Hollow Loves Pasquale Day" last week!
Didn't stick.
Oh, listen, I want to invite you to my anniversary party!
Absolutely!
Which husband?
Oh, no husband, honey, I'm talking about a lover that's been far more loyal and seductive than a husband.
I'm talking about that business we call show!
- Forty years!
- No!
Forty years ago today, I did my first play, off Broadway.
- Off Broadway?
- Cleveland.
That is off Broadway.
Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party.
Food, booze, a little song, a little dance, a little salsa down your pants.
- Well, count me and my pants in.
- Oh!
Wonderful!
I will even drag Luke there.
So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.
Oh, Luke won't come.
Sure he will, I have very effective methods of persuasion.
They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.
No, honey, the party's on Tuesday, the 30th.
- So?
- So, the 30th is the "dark day".
- What dark day?
- Luke's "dark day".
The day that he disappears.
Disappears?
Where?
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows where he goes or what he does, all we know is not to try and find him.
Why didn't I know about this?
I don't know, honey, everyone else does.
Anyhow, you come yourself, okay?
Eight o'clock!
I'll be there.
See you Tuesday, Patty.
Ah!
Pasquale, the Maestro!
My God, you look virile today.
Are you sure your wife won't share you?
Oh, she's good.
I don't agree.
You're living in a fantasy world.
I have classes all day long.
I hear you protesting.
I've got a double major of poli-sci and bio-chem, Terrence!
I see you over-scheduling.
Sorry, I'm just getting a water here.
Paris, you're not yelling at me, you're yelling at the world.
I'm not yelling at all.
This is the natural register of my voice.
It's the register of a timid little girl who is not putting herself out there.
I am putting myself out there!
Why are you arguing with Terrence?
Why?
Look.
I know I haven't dated lately, but Asher was very important to me.
Hey Paris, I can't find my notebook?
The black one with all the yellow notes in it.
You have not put yourself out there.
He just died.
Oh, for God's sake, he was halfway dead when you met him.
Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?
Out where?
Out in the world.
Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?
You don't just meet people!
It doesn't happen.
Um, I'll just go in my room now.
Look at your dream log, you are months behind.
And your pretty thoughts journal.
Okay, fine.
I have neglected thinking pretty.
But I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost while you were in court ordered rehab!
Hey Paris, what's this?
I had a back problem.
The prescription was at home in my File-o-fax.
This is a message from Headmaster Charleston.
When did Headmaster Charleston call?
- Earlier.
- And you didn't tell me?
I'm in session.
Hello, Headmaster Charleston, this is Rory Gilmore.
I'm sorry it took so long to call you back, I just got your message.
Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive.
We should talk later.
So, um, how are you?
I'm very well.
How are you enjoying Yale?
I love it!
Is it everything you thought it would be?
It's nothing like I thought it would be, it's better actually.
I have no doubt.
Now, I'm calling because we often ask a former Chilton student to host a prospective Yale student for a couple of days.
Show them around, let them observe classes, campus life, that sort of thing.
I was wondering if you'd be interested.
- Me?
- Yes, this is a very special young lady.
Bright, focused, quietly determined.
She reminds me a great deal of you.
- Thank you.
- I assume you haven't changed.
Well, I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit, but I'm basically still me.
Excellent.
Then I hope you'll consider accepting.
I know your workload must be substantial.
- That's okay.
I can handle it.
- So I can take that as a yes?
Yes.
Take it as a yes.
And thank you, I'm honored.
Her name is Anna Fairchild.
She's sixteen years old and she'll be arriving Monday morning at nine o'clock.
- Does that work for you?
- That works perfectly.
Very well, it's a date.
I'm very glad to talk to you again, Miss Gilmore.
Yale certainly sounds like it's agreeing with you.
I hope it will also agree with Miss Fairchild.
- Like Sabrina!
- I beg your pardon?
Sabrina Fairchild, that was her name.
Have we segued into discussing a movie?
And we can segue right out again.
I'm very grateful for that.
All right then, my office will be contacting you with the particulars.
I hope you have a wonderful time.
I'm sure Miss Fairchild will.
Thank you, Headmaster Charleston, I won't let you down.
What I nice thing to hear.
I'm sure we'll be talking soon.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Well this is a very big honor, you know.
- Oh, I know.
Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale, they're asking you.
I know!
I know.
Well, have you thought about what kinds of things you'd like to show her?
Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course.
And then I thought she'd got to the paper with me and then I thought maybe a trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library.
Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.
- Steve?
- Bible.
R ight.
Then I was torn between taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle or the Science Center and gymnasium.
Huh.
That is a conundrum.
Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then, you'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.
Lorelai, these things are of great interest to any young person considering attending Yale.
Oh, I am sure.
I, personally, would enjoy every single thing on my list.
Yes, I know.
But it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in.
I'm not talking a kegger, but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling "Give me a location" or something like that.
- You know, your mother may be right.
- Who heard that?
Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience.
It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun, too.
Oh, have her touch the toe!
- Yeah!
- Touch the toe?
The toe!
The statue of Theodore Woolsey.
It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet.
And for that reason he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.
Wow, that is fun!
Make sure you get a parent consent form for that one.
Oh, it is so exciting watching you at Yale.
Such a wonderful time for me.
The people that you meet there will stay with you for the rest of your life, mark my words.
Tell me, are you making good friends?
Yeah, I have some good friends.
And what about Mr. Huntzberger?
Who's Mr. Huntzberger?
Um, Logan Huntzberger's a boy I go to school with.
A fine boy, from a fine family.
- You know him?
- His parents are very good friends of ours.
Oh, you know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai!
No.
He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.
No.
His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.
Oh!
...
No.
Well, Logan is their son.
And I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night?
The other night?
He's very nice, Grandpa.
I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.
Uh, was this Logan at the "Male Yale" party you threw?
He's the one who gave me a ride home, Mom.
Oh, Limo boy.
Swell.
He's also on the paper with me.
You know, his father owns some of the finest papers in the country.
- I know.
- Not a bad connection, huh?
Nope, not a bad connection at all.
- Hey!
So tell me about this Logan.
- It's three degrees out here.
Uh, as of tonight my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do.
That's not right or fair.
He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do.
For him the dish is always half empty.
You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?
What is the deal with this guy?
Are you dating?
No, we're not dating!
He's just a friend.
How close?
For example, if we freeze to death will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?
I know him from school, he's just a casual friend, that's it.
- Do you think he's cute?
- What does it matter if I think he's cute?
Uh, it matters to me.
I don't want ugly grandchildren.
Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone.
Since Dean, I'm taking a boy break, okay?
- I'm just concentrating on school, that's it.
- Fine.
If that changes?
- You'll be the first to know.
- 'Kay.
Thank you.
- 'Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father.
- I know.
Info on you and looking better in chiffon, that's about it.
Oh, and my pole-dance is way hotter.
- I'm frozen now.
- Okay.
Let's go.
In my hand, ladies and gentlemen, sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner.
I am never more than ten feet away from pie.
Ah, see, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.
Oh, it's heaven!
One quick trip downstairs and I have all the treats I want.
- You're like Willy Wonka but hotter.
- I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.
Slap on a purple top hat and you're close.
This is nice.
I think it's going very well, you and me.
You think it's going very well?
I have very few complaints.
Hmm.
I'm going right past the very few complaints comment, 'cause I know you're just trying to bait me.
What complaints?
Hey, so Luke?
Miss Patty is celebrating her forty year anniversary.
Which husband?
With the business we call show.
Oh, him.
And she's having a big party and I told her we'd go.
Oh, man.
It'll be fun.
It will not be fun.
She'll be wearing tap shoes, and there'll be songs and punch and at least one story about Milton Berle's penis.
- Only one?
- Come on!
I have to have you there.
- Otherwise people will think I made you up.
- Fine.
I'll go.
Thank you.
Okay, so it's Tuesday at eight o'clock.
I can't go Tuesday.
- Why not?
- I have to go out of town.
- Why?
- Business.
Business?
Now you're Willy Loman?
Banking business in Woodbury, standing appointment.
Sorry.
Hit the light, will you?
I have to get up early. 'Night.
Okay. 'Night.
Wait till you see all the stuff I got for Anna.
Yale tee-shirt.
Bulldogs sweatshirt.
Yale baseball cap.
Visor.
Coffee mug.
I told you to open a window when you're hot gluing in here.
It's freezing outside.
Oh, wait.
This is new, they just came out with this.
The Yale soda cozy.
How cute is that?
I can't believe you.
You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore, and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know?
I'm trying to make her feel welcome.
Oh, she'll feel welcome.
They all feel welcome.
- Who's "they"?
- The enemy.
Who's the enemy?
Any girl under the age of seventeen is the enemy.
- Okay, I'm opening a window now.
- They're coming for everything.
They're going to take our jobs, our thunder, our starter husbands.
- Don't you have a class to get to?
- They're coming, Rory.
They're coming, and they are going to keep on coming.
Like the locusts descending on Mankato.
We'll be beating them off for the rest of our lives.
Please don't be here when she arrives, I don't want you to scare her off.
Me?
Scare her off?
Please.
She's the one with the alabaster skin and the perky breasts.
Do not say "perky breasts" to her, do you understand me?
Eve Harrington has arrived.
Hi.
I'm looking for Rory Gilmore?
- I'm Rory, you must be Anna.
- Yes.
Great, come in.
You find it okay?
I got lost a couple of times, but people were really nice and got me here.
Yeah, it's a friendly world out there, isn't it?
Anna, this is my roommate Paris, and I'm sorry.
For what?
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Okay, let me show you around the place.
That is Paris' room.
Don't go in.
That is my room, and this is the common room which is also your bedroom.
Bathroom is literally outside the door.
And there's a fridge, with water or soda or whatever you want - oh!
And I got you some welcome to Yale gifts!
Oh!
Really?
Thank you.
I'm really glad you're here.
You are going to love Yale, it's an amazing place.
I mean, I was excited when I first started here, but every day is different and better.
You have no idea how much there is to learn.
It's - oh, well, you'll see.
Okay.
I actually snagged us some caviar.
They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos and achieve a very similar result.
Hey.
- This is Anna.
- Did Paris move?
- I'm right here, Marty.
- I know, Paris.
Anna is from Chilton, my alma mater, and I'm showing her around Yale for a couple days.
Oh, cool.
I'll put this in the fridge.
In my room.
Thanks!
Okay, you ready?
I'm ready.
You have boys bringing you food?
Yale is a magical place, Anna.
A magical, magical place.
The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the old campus, and it houses most of the undergraduate freshman class.
It was begun be Theodore Dwight Woolsey, president of Yale from 1846 to 1871.
Over here is the Elihu Yale bench.
Now, Eli Yale was an officer in the British East Indian Company.
He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds and 417 books and a portrait of King George the first.
And so it was renamed in his honor.
He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school but Yale College never recieved it because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existing Collegiate School, apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him.
Oh, wait.
This is the wrong bench.
So keep the story, but cross out the diagram.
Moving on.
There's actually an ongoing rumor that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
Imagine all the tables you could wait with those skills, huh?
Okay.
You are about to get a first-hand feel of what it's like to work on a real newspaper.
Now be prepared.
It is an extremely hectic, fast-paced environment.
Don't get intimidated and don't get in the way.
Ready?
Here it is.
Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something.
But you just wait.
It can heat up in a second, and when it does, man, watch out.
My desk is over here.
I do not care!
Hey!
I am your editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me!
I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.
You will if you want to stay on this newspaper!
Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalistic dilemmas between reporter and editor - the right to protect sources.
Damn it, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now!
The pen fairy.
That is one of my personal fine point gel tipped pens from my bottom right hand drawer.
And you went into that drawer and you took that pen and it's mine!
Okay.
For "fine point gel tips" substitute "confidential source deep within the administration".
Huh?
You get a little thrill, don't you?
Hang on a sec.
Hey.
Question.
Have you ever heard anything about Luke's "dark day"?
His what?
Well, one day a year he apparently has a "dark day".
No one knows where he goes or what he does, he just disappears.
I've heard nothing about this.
Okay, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?
How am I supposed to know?
Because, you keep all those crazy anal Bob Graham kind of notebooks.
"Eight a. m., got up.
Eight fifteen, brushed teeth.
Eight twenty-five, had impure thoughts.
Eight thirty-six, sent dwarves off to work. "
I do not have my diaries from last November on me at the moment.
- But you do have them.
- Yes.
And they will contain where we ate breakfast that morning.
- Yes.
- I love my little circus freak.
- I call you later.
- Hey, did your Mini-Me show up?
Yeah, her name's Anna.
She's right here.
- Oh, how's the tour going?
- It's going great.
How many boring bench lectures did you give?
Two.
But they were about the same bench.
Oh, you know what?
I have someone standing abnormally close to me right now.
I'll call you later?
Okay, say hi to Kirk for me.
'Kay, bye.
Kirk!
What can I do for you?
- I have a business proposition for you.
- Okay.
- How often do you slip in your tub?
- Never.
- Okay, it doesn't work if you answer like that, so...
- Constantly.
I never stop slipping even when I get out.
I thought so.
Then my new line of bath and shower adhesive decals are for you.
Huh. "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow. "
Yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
Well, Kirk this looks very impressive.
And wow, very expensive.
Well, it's yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
Hmm.
Well, why don't you leave the catalogue with me and I'll look it over?
- Could you look at it now?
It's the only one I have.
- Okay.
I like that one.
If you put the fishes' faces together it looks like they're kissing.
Oh, hey, Kirk.
Do you know anything about Luke's dark day?
Everyone knows about Luke's dark day.
Do you know what it is?
Not the details, just that he has it once a year.
I think it goes back a long, long time.
Yeah?
Sure, I mean, Luke's always had a touch of darkness in him.
I guess we all do, but Luke's a little more touched than some.
He's kind of grabbed, actually.
What do you think it's about?
When I was in seventh grade, Luke knocked the books out of my hands.
Because of his dark day?
No, everyone knocked my books out of my hands.
I was kind of a target.
I used to wear a cape to school.
Now, outside, we just passed the women's table, which was designed by Maya Lin.
She's also the one who designed the Vietnam War memorial, which, by the way, originally was a class project for which she received a 'B'.
The teacher who gave the 'B' also submitted a design for the war memorial, but hers was chosen.
His was not.
That's a life lesson to remember.
This is Sterling Memorial Library.
One of my favorite places on campus.
It was built in 1930 and it houses over one third of the University's ten million volumes.
I love libraries.
I just spend I can't tell you how many hours just - you're not writing.
Oh.
Sorry.
- I come here sometimes late at night...
- I just love how everybody's dressed.
- What?
- No uniforms.
I love that there's no uniforms.
College, to me, means no more uniforms.
Oh, right.
However, wait till you're late for class and it takes you twenty minutes to put together an outfit.
Suddenly you'll miss those uniforms.
How many guys have you dated since you've been here?
Oh, well, none from Yale.
Anyhow, the books - are you seeing the books?
Everything you'd want to read is right here.
Feel it.
Feels good, right?
Now smell it.
Nothing, nothing smells like that.
I'm sorry, excuse me - did I just see you smell that book?
- Hey, Logan.
- Hey, Ace.
Who's your friend?
Oh, Anna, this is Logan.
Logan, this is Anna, she's from my high school.
- I'm showing her around campus.
- Hi.
High school?
Naw, I woulda sworn you were a college girl.
- So is she showing you a good time?
- I'm showing her everything important.
Mmm.
Good.
Make sure she takes you by the pub.
Local place, everyone goes there.
- I'm not taking her to the pub.
- Oh, please?
The pub sounds fun.
You don't have to drink, they do have coffee.
It's a cool scene, make her take you.
Bring a book to sniff!
- What are you doing in a library anyhow?
- Got lost.
Don't tell anyone I was here, ruin my rep.
Anna, it's been a pleasure.
See you, Ace.
He's cute.
Yes, he is.
But not as cute as Pushkin.
Right this way, missy.
I'm not being mean, I'm just
- Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Well I'm sorry you're so upset!
Well, you're giving me a week's notice!
What am I supposed to do with a week's notice?
Well my son just called me from Florida, telling me about the condo, Luke!
Okay fine, go!
And enjoy Florida, I hear they have great weather there.
Terrific hurricanes!
Make sure you bring plenty of plywood and bottled water!
- Hey, hi, hello!
- What are you doing here?
I was just driving down the street and I saw you guys, thought I'd stop by and say hey, hi, hello.
- Hello Mrs. Thompson.
- Hello, dear.
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing.
Nothing's going on.
Luke, please understand there's nothing I can do!
I've already found someone else to rent the house and they have cars!
- And you just agreed to that!
- Well, it seemed rather reasonable to me!
- Oh, come on!
- Um...
- Luke's very upset with me.
- Why?
Well, his father rented the garage, he was building a boat and he didn't have room at his place, so he paid me to do it here.
And then when he died, Luke continued to pay me for the garage, and now I'm moving to a nursing home and I need him to move his boat!
You're mad because this little old lady is moving to a nursing home and you have to move your boat.
Is this really the story you want to stick to?
She called me out of the blue, and I've paid for an entire month.
I can give you a partial refund if you like.
Where am I supposed to find a space to store a boat on a moment's notice?
Huh?
Did you think about that for even a second?
Could we sit down?
The doctor says the screw in my hip is loose.
Yes, yes, let's sit and calmly try to figure this out.
No, no, I've got it figured out.
Just haul it off!
Trash it!
- Haul what off?
- The boat?
Yes, the boat.
Scrap it.
Find somebody to drag it away and cut it up for firewood!
- Oh, now Luke...
- Who's going to haul it off?
Anyone.
Just find a guy with a truck and a hook.
Strap it on and drive it away and send me the bill.
I'm done!
Luke - we'll be right back.
Luke, stop!
What, what and what?
I have paid that woman every month for fifteen years!
Luke, she's moving to a nursing home!
And my dad was paying her every month for twenty years before that!
- Nursing home, Luke!
- I know where she's going!
- She's not trying to hurt you.
- Whatever.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Back to the diner.
- Let me drive you.
- No.
Look, I can drive you back to the diner.
I promise if we pass any senior citizens I'll let you jump out and pants them.
Fine.
And here we have the world famous Luke's diner, home of the best coffee on the east coast and the most delightful and chatty proprietor since Mel kissed Flo's grits.
Okay, well, I should get back to the Inn.
I hope you've enjoyed your tour and don't forget to buy yourself a souvenir plastic monkey on the way out.
Tomorrow's the anniversary of my dad's death.
Oh - oh, hon...
And every year on that anniversary...
I disappear.
I don't work.
I don't talk to anyone.
I get in kind of a funk - it's like... um...
- You have a "dark day".
- Yeah.
I have a dark day.
I thought I should tell you this because we're in a relationship, and I thought you might wonder why I suddenly don't answer the phone, or I'm not around.
Why you can't flip your hair and con me into going to Miss Patty's crazy anniversary party.
The hair flip is that effective, huh?
Combine that with your black dress, you could probably get me to be your backup dancer.
I'll remember that.
I've never told anyone this before.
I don't really like to talk about it.
I guess that explains the thing with Mrs. Thompson.
Yeah.
Some timing, her springing this boat thing on me now.
I'll apologize to her.
You know, I never finished that boat.
It's been sitting there half done for fifteen years.
Hey, Luke, don't you think you might have been a little hasty about the boat decision?
I mean, you were upset, and I bet some day you're going to be really sorry you don't have that boat anymore.
No, it's better she gets rid of the thing now.
But...
I haven't even looked at that boat since my dad got sick.
Not a glance, nothing.
Even more reason.
If it's gone, then I don't have to deal with it.
It's time to move on, you know?
- But...
- I'm fine.
Really.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Any time.
- I love it here!
- You love it here?
We just walked in!
I know, but it feels so collegiate!
Actually, you know what is great about this place?
Eli Yale drank here?
No, they make amazing cappuccinos.
You want one?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You go sit and I'll get the coffees.
- Two cappuccinos, please.
- Sure thing.
- Hey.
- Hi, you just get here?
Yep.
- You want a...
- Yes, please.
I'm sorry, could you make that three cappuccinos?
- So how's it going?
- I think I may have overwhelmed Anna.
Her hand cramped up about an hour ago, and it's been smasming ever since.
- Really?
Where is she?
- She's right there...
I turn around for one minute.
Excuse me.
Rory, Mark and Matthew were just telling me about a great party tonight.
Really, well that was very nice of them.
Thank you, Matthew and Mark, was it?
- That's right.
- Well, how biblical.
Okay, well, our schedule is completely full at the moment, but if that changes - if things lighten up, or if she suddenly ages two years in the next three hours, then we'll know where to find you.
Okay?
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
We'll be over here, just in case.
- Rory!
- Anna!
Well this is so not fair.
You get to talk to boys.
- What?
- Well, you were over there talking to Marty.
That's different.
Marty's just a friend.
Which is another great thing about college.
You learn to have guy friends.
Nothing romantic, just a good pal.
Those boys are not interested in your friendship, unless the word "friendship" is tattooed on your butt.
Now drink your coffee.
It's good, huh?
Can I sleep with the TV on?
Um, yeah, as long as you don't wake Paris up, and that advice is for your own good.
- And if I can't go to sleep?
- Then you don't go to sleep.
I love that!
I love not having someone to tell me when to go to sleep.
Yes, it's great.
I love sleeping with the TV on, and I love having no parents around, and I love cappuccino, and I love apple muffins, and I love college!
What's she on?
Four cappuccinos and three Red Bulls from the fridge.
Enjoy your night.
How do I look?
- Where are you going?
- I'm putting myself out there, Rory.
- Now?
- Yes now.
It's eleven o'clock at night, who are you hoping to hook up with now, Spike and Drusilla?
Just tell me if my lipstick is too whorish.
Nope, just whorish enough.
Going out at eleven o'clock at night?
I love college!
I may suffocate her when I get back.
Hey, if you can catch her.
- Bye.
- Good luck.
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.
Which brings us to this question.
Does Campbell's work successfully resolve the disparate stances of Jung and Freud when it comes to the collective unconscious?
...
Hey, pay attention.
Professor Bell is one of the foremost philosophy professors in the country.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- ... archetypes bordering on metaphysical?
All right.
Let's call that close enough.
But now, Camel can point to the repetition of the hero myth in culture after culture and say, "Hey Sigmund!
Like it or not, here are the same basic characters over and over"...
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I'm right in the middle of a class, young man.
I know, I'm sorry.
Rory, you can't just walk out like that.
Not after everything we've been through.
You just left.
I was still in bed, I mean, what is that all about?
- Okay, you need to do this later.
- I can't do this later.
Rory, I love you.
I love you, damn it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
God, just talk to me!
- Okay, out!
Right now, just get...
- Colin!
What are you doing, man?
- Get the hell out of here!
- She's with me now, I told you that.
Let it go.
I will not let it go!
She doesn't love you, Rory, tell him you don't love him!
- Everything was fine until you came along!
- Don't blame me 'cause you couldn't keep her!
- I swear to God, I'm going to kill you.
- Oh, I'd love to see you try.
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
Anthony, get security!
Stop - break it up!
What are you - gentlemen!
You are losing control!
You are in a classroom, stop it!
All right, that's enough, break it up, you two!
Rory Gilmore, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Toying with these boys like this.
They used to have pride.
They used to have dignity.
They used to have balls.
Damn it Gilmore, give 'em back their balls!
- God, this is a lot of junk.
- I know.
I mean, who has three Thigh Masters, besides Suzanne Somers.
Well, Mrs. Thompson, apparently.
You'd think if she had three Thigh Masters she'd wear some slacks once in a while.
And, I'm sorry, why exactly did you have to take all this crap?
It was the only way I could get her to give me the boat.
Some guy wanted it, and she got him to buy all her other crap, so if I wanted the boat I had to take everything, and that's what I did.
I just have to hide it for a few days, then I'll move it.
Where?
I don't know.
Somewhere.
The Inn!
I'll put it in the old stable out back.
- Are you ever going to tell Luke?
- Yes!
- Oh, when?
- A week, a year
- I haven't thought that far in advance.
I just couldn't let her get rid of his dad's boat!
What if we hang the Thigh Masters on it?
- Or get more trees!
- Yeah, or get more trees!
- Jackson's got some trees at home.
- Think I could borrow them?
Sure!
We'll just wait 'till he lies down for his nap and sneak them right out of there.
Great.
Then I'll hop a fence and get Richard Widmark to sign my grapefruit.
I'd like to welcome you all to today's speed dating session.
Many of you have been with us before, many of you are first timers.
So, for the latter group, here are the rules.
Each couple will have one minute to talk and get a sense of the person across from them.
When the bell rings, the women will get up and switch tables.
Men, stay where you are.
This will continue until every woman has met every man and after that, it's up to you.
Are we all ready?
Then let the dating begin.
- I'm Jack.
- Paris.
- Parents travel a lot?
- Why?
- Your name is Paris.
- No.
- Did your parents change flat tires a lot?
- What?
- Or plug the phone into the wall a lot?
- No.
Great.
So we've cleared up that mystery.
What's next on your fascinating list of talking points?
- Uh - what's your major?
- Seriously?
You've got one minute to make an impression and that's all you can come up with?
You want to know my sign, too, Jack?
Or how about my favorite color or if I'm a "Britney" or a "Christina"?
Here, I'll ask you a question.
Was the last time you had an interesting thought when you considered flinging yourself off a building?
Bye, Jack.
I'll write mother immediately.
Paris, and no, my parents didn't travel.
Billy, and I have no idea what that means.
Never mind.
So, what's your story, Billy?
- Well, I'm a drama major...
- Ding, ding, ding!
- Doyle!
- Paris.
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I can say the same for you.
So, you find any good prospects?
- Oh, yes, one girl wants to have eleven children.
- Good God!
The second one was cut off quickly - thank you, by the way -
I believe the words "Latter-Day Saints" were about to come out of her mouth.
I can't believe I came here.
It's my third time.
You ever meet anyone you actually wanted to date?
My bar is so not that high.
I don't see one person in this room that shouldn't be sterilized immediately.
Right there with ya.
So, you've been reading about those skeletons they've been finding on the island of Flores, right?
Oh yeah.
I mean, they're only 13,000 years old.
That's nothing, in geological time.
They made tools, and probably had a language, and...
Keep moving, sister.
You know, they were supposed to be master hunters.
Even though they were diminutive in size.
And then, when that other guy came in in that outfit - how great was that!
We also studied Dylan Thomas today.
Why don't we talk about that for a while?
Yeah.
That was cool, but when Logan and Colin started to fight, that was so amazing.
The teacher had nothing to say, nothing.
He just stood there.
Do you think they'll get in trouble for that?
- Probably not.
- God, that's great!
I mean, you can do anything in college.
No rules, no consequences...
Well, Anna, there are always consequences.
You're getting the wrong idea.
College is not just a crazy, wild, sleep-deprived, hedonistic society.
Oh.
It wasn't the TV.
No.
It wasn't the TV.
This isn't what it looks like.
I hope not.
- I told you it wasn't the TV.
- Hi, Paris.
All right, fine.
Doyle and I had sex.
Okay, Anna, get your coat.
We met at speed dating, and we considered having dinner first, but we both knew where it was going to end up, so we figured we'd just cut to the chase and save the calories.
- Hurry up, Anna.
- Where are we going?
Dinner.
It's only five.
You have no right to be repulsed by my sex life.
This is an exceptionally comfortable robe.
Dinner whenever you want, random sex whenever you want, I can't wait to go to college!
Ice cream and cereal for dinner!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, college rocks.
Ladies!
- Hi, Logan!
- How we doing this fine evening?
- We're doing great, you want to join us?
- Sure.
- So, dull day, uh?
- Not for me.
- Someone's quiet.
- Got nothing to say.
- Do you get the sense that she's mad at me?
- Yep.
Hey, Anna, why don't you head on over to the Fro-Yo social.
You remember where it is, right?
Yeah, but I just had three scoops of ice cream.
Kid, you're in college now, okay?
Now go get yourself some yogurt!
Are you going to come, Logan?
Aw, I'm not sure how well I'll be walking here in a minute, Anna.
Oh!
Okay.
Bye.
That's not a good look.
- I have no words...
- It was just a joke!
Oh, no, wait.
I thought of some.
Jerk!
Ass, arrogant, inconsiderate, mindless, frat-boy, low-life, butt-faced miscreant!
Butt-faced miscreant"!
Why would you do something like that?
I'm sorry, butt-faced miscreant"?
Here I am, trying to show Anna what college life is really like, and...
- That is what college life is really like!
- Maybe your college life.
Not mine.
That was my class, Logan.
That was my professor who decides my grades.
- And you made me look ridiculous to him.
- No, I made me look ridiculous to him.
Oh, you don't think he thinks I was a part of it?
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him you were an innocent bystander.
The whole class was in a frenzy the entire time.
We never got back to what we were talking about.
There's another class next week!
Ugh.
I know that classes and the paper and Yale in general mean nothing to you, but it means something to me.
Professor Bell's course is only six weeks long, and you blew one of those weeks for me.
I won't get that week back.
Look, you want up close and personal time with Bell?
My dad knows him.
- He'll arrange...
- Please stop talking.
I'm sorry you're so bent out of shape.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke.
If Anna thinks that Yale is a big joke after spending five minutes with you, then she was always going to think that Yale's just a big joke.
Relax.
You and me?
Very different people.
I have to go.
To the Fro-Yo social.
Yes.
I have to go to the Fro-Yo social.
And yes, I do realize how incredibly stupid that just sounded.
Excuse me.
All I'm saying is, I just want a little information.
Is this a relationship?
A one-night stand?
The beginning of a series of late-night booty calls?
I think I have the right to know.
I hear you.
Doyle, do you hear her?
I do hear her, I just don't understand why we can't decide this amongst ourselves.
Because you can't, Doyle.
Now, please tell Paris how you feel.
- Well, I feel that...
- Speak into the phone, Doyle, I can't hear you.
- Is Anna here?
- No, why?
- She didn't show up at the Fro-Yo social!
- Geez, do you blame her?
- I have to find her.
- Why, did you loan her money or something?
Just go back to what you were doing, please.
Hey, Marty?
Um
- I lost Anna.
I don't know where.
Um - just...
Thanks.
- If she comes back here, call me.
- Go ahead, Doyle.
Tell him.
Any idea where she'd go?
No!
She was supposed to meet me, I can't believe I let her go off by herself.
Well, we'll find her.
- Mom?
- Hi!
Where would a sixteen-year-old girl go for a good time?
Oh, how sad you had to come to me for this conversation.
- Mom...
- You were sixteen a lot more recently than I was.
- I lost Anna.
- How did you lose Anna?
She never showed at the Fro-Yo social!
Okay.
Relax.
Sixteen-year-old girl at college.
You have to check parties.
- Bars and Chinese restaurants rarely card.
- There's no Chinese restaurants around!
- The pub, did you check the pub?
- No.
The pub, we have to check the pub.
Parties and the pub.
- Okay.
Call me when you...
- Ow!
- Uh, I have to go, hon, call me when you find her.
- Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh my God, are you okay?
I smashed my leg on a Thigh Master.
I'm so sorry.
And then I tripped and smashed my other leg on another Thigh Master.
I'm sorry.
Why the hell do you have so many Thigh Masters?
I have a really bad thigh complex.
Are you bleeding?
Do you want to come in?
No, I'm fine, I just...
You left your glasses at my house.
I thought you might need them.
Thank you.
I didn't think you'd be here, I thought you were going to Patty's.
I am.
I was just leaving.
But I don't have to go if you want to come in.
Naw, it's okay.
I'm still going through my, uh, dark day.
I'm going to go.
Okay.
Sorry about your foot.
- What's going on with your garage?
- What?
Your garage door looks all weird.
Oh, no, it's fine, its - jammed.
Leave it.
No, you can't leave it open like that, you could ruin all your stuff.
No, no, no, that's okay
- I have too much stuff anyhow, so if some of it gets ruined, serves me right for being so darn materialistic!
- What are all these trees doing here?
- No, no, no, just stop.
Go back to your dark day.
No, no, don't.
There's clowns in there, and puppies wearing costumes and they'll cheer you up and then your dark day will be ruined...
What is this?
- It's your boat.
- I thought I told her to get rid of this boat.
She did.
She sold it to me, along with all her other crap.
She made quite a killing, actually.
I just couldn't stand the idea that you might regret - someday - giving this boat away.
- Even though I said I wanted it gone.
- Yes, I know, but you were upset.
Oh, I was cranky.
Now I'm upset.
- Sorry.
I just thought...
- You thought about you.
You thought about you and how you'd feel.
You didn't think about me, or the fact that I said I wanted to get rid of this damn boat.
I mean, I said it, Lorelai.
I said it, you heard it, and you ignored it.
- Because I didn't want you...
- You had no respect for what I wanted.
This was my dad.
This was his boat and this decision was mine.
This was not yours.
I know.
This is who I am.
I don't want to hang on to things, or stare at things.
Except my horoscope.
Which was absolutely the wrong thing to bring up right now.
I'm sorry.
I'm getting out of here.
No, I'm sorry.
Please.
Stay and yell at me.
Why, what's the point?
You don't listen to anything I say anyhow.
- She's nowhere.
- She's not nowhere.
This is all my fault.
There's more bars, we'll find her.
God, I'm so stupid.
If I didn't have to confront Logan like that I wouldn't have had to send her off on her own
- and we wouldn't be looking for her right now.
- We'll find her!
He's so frustrating, that guy.
I mean, I don't know what I did to get on his bad side, or why he just has to come after me.
Oh, stop it!
- What?
- He's not coming after you.
He likes you.
- He does not.
- Oh, please, Rory.
Marty, he does not like me.
I mean, look at what he did.
Look at that stunt he pulled.
He totally humiliated me.
Attention like that from people like Logan is like being tapped.
You've been anointed.
You're in.
- In what?
- In with him.
With his group.
He likes you.
Stop being so naive, it's annoying.
Marty...
- Hello?
- Miss Gilmore, Headmaster Charleston here.
Oh.
Hi, Headmaster Charleston.
What's going on?
Well, not much, thank you for asking.
I was just wondering how things are going with Miss Fairchild.
- Oh, Fine.
- Yes?
- Everything's great.
- Wonderful!
Then I can inform Anna's parents that the under-aged girl the Yale campus police found when they broke up a rather raucous Yale party is, in fact, not their daughter.
I'm sorry, Headmaster Charleston.
And what a help that is.
I tried.
I just
- I turned around for a moment.
Did she tell you about the bench?
'Cause I spent a lot of time...
I'm sorry, Miss Gilmore, I have to go.
Some angry parents will be here in a moment to talk to me.
I appreciate the attempt.
Good luck at Yale.
Bye, Headmaster Charleston.
The campus police got her.
She came, she spent one day with me and she got sent home by the police.
I think I'm going to retroactively flunk high school.
At least she's safe, right?
Right.
Crappy, crappy day.
You want to take a cab?
My treat.
Thanks.
I think I'm going to walk.
- Marty...
- I'll
- I'll see you tomorrow.
What are you doing?
I smell like trees.
You do?
Hey!
Me too!
Now we're the crazy pine scented ladies.
How's your punch?
It's good.
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
Just fine.
Thank you!
Thank you, everyone!
I'm honored that you came here to help me celebrate forty wonderful years on the stage.
It feels so good to be here in front of an audience, and so close to a piano!
So close to a piano!
Kirk!
Sorry.
Hey, Patty, why don't you do a little something for us?
Well, if you insist.
Hit it.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
See, there's a reason why I stay away from people on this particular day.
It's 'cause I kind of suck.
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.
I should have listened to you.
I should have stayed out of it.
You were right, I didn't think.
I mean, I didn't think like you would think.
I thought like I would think.
And my thinking is sometimes very, very wrong if you're not me, and occasionally if you are me...
You just keep thinking like you'd think.
I can do that.
Do you want to come in?
You get drunk just standing next to the punch bowl.
No, I'm still kinda...
I get it.
- I just didn't want us to...
- We're not.
- You go have a good time.
- See you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Logan!
Huh?
Richard!
Wow, this is a pleasant surprise!
Finn, Colin, you know Richard, don't you?
Well, hello, boys.
Nice to see you.
Logan, I wanted to talk to you.
I just heard about the incident.
The...?
I heard that you professed your feelings for Rory.
Wha...?
Mr. Bell is a very dear friend of mine, as is the Dean of admissions.
- Well, you know in this place, news travels fast...
- Yeah, look...
I have to tell you that, while I understand what could have driven you to such a public display of affection, there is an appropriate time and place for that sort of thing.
And a classroom in the middle of class is not one of them.
- No, I know, I...
- However, what's done is done.
It's out.
So I dropped by to tell you that I have spoken to your father.
- My father?
- We pounded out a few things.
- Property agreements, pre-nups, that sort of thing.
- Okay, I think that there's been...
Oh, we came to a very fair agreement.
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
Now, we're setting up a dinner for next week to finalize the engagement and start talking about the ceremony.
Emily is handling all the newspaper announcements, so, not to worry.
That's all taken care of.
- But...
- She is a fine young lady, Logan.
I want her to be happy.
You'll take care of that, I assume.
All right, I'll let you get back to your coffee break.
Nice seeing all of you again.
And Logan... welcome to the family, son.
I do hope one of his dopey looking friends knows CPR, or he just might not make it.
You're the best, Grandpa!
All right, who's next?
Paris giving you any trouble?
Not anymore than usual.
However, there is a girl in my modern poetry class who keeps kicking my chair.
Ah, I do love this place.
Right back at you, Grandpa.
(♪)
What you want?
The usual?
The usual, Ahmad.
Here you go, sir.
All right.
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
WOMAN:
Hi, Vada.
Vada, I'll take those.
No, Millie.
He owes me from last week.
You can settle that some other time.
Thank you.
You look cute.
Coffee's here, Mr. Armstrong.
Millie, how many times do I have to tell you?
Coffee is a drink.
A latte is an experience.
So's a month in Tahiti.
Take that down to Margo for me, please.
There's one left.
Oh, that's for you, sweetie, to sip as you sail to, uh, Tahiti.
Dr. Schiller?
Dr. Schiller?
(GERMAN ACCENT) Oh, John, sorry.
Are you all right?
Just thinking about Prexelin.
What's this?
Raspberry latte.
That's your favorite, right?
So it is.
Thank you.
To Prexelin.
Tell me, John, are you married?
You know I'm not.
That's right.
You're the one with the self-imposed bachelor term limits.
I believe 31 was the magic number.
A man should be married by the age of 31, thus ensuring himself to be young enough to enjoy playing with his kids, yet old enough, at the same time, and, we presume mature enough,
to provide for said family a modicum of luxuries, as well as boundless emotional support.
Well said.
Somewhat clinical, but well said, nonetheless.
There's only one problem, though.
What's that?
Well, I'm 30 years old, the youngest VP at Progeia.
I make great money, but I'm not sure I'd like to be married.
And I'm not sure if I'd like to be married with kids.
I worked hard for my career...
Get married, John.
Have kids.
Lots of them.
As many as you can afford.
Careers aren't real, especially ones like ours.
You put your whole life into your work, your company, then one day... it's all for naught.
(IN GERMAN) All for nothing.
(IN ENGLISH) Would you excuse me, please?
I have several things to attend to.
Sure thing.
I apologize, Dr. Schiller.
John... not to know is bad.
Not to wish to know is worse.
That's a non-sequitur, isn't it?
African proverb, I believe.
I've never heard that one before, sir.
Find a wonderful lady, wed her, and have lots of kids.
Will do.
Thank you.
Auf Wiedersehen!
Help!
Help!

Margo, what the hell is going on?
Dr. Schiller just flew out of his office window.
Maybe he's the smart one.
They fucked us, Jack.
Who are they?
They hung us out to dry, and they fucked us where it hurts.
Margo, please, listen.
Look, Dr. Schiller is dead.
I don't know what happened.
He slipped, jumped, something.
Do you think I give a fuck about that Kraut?
I'm talking about Prexelin!
Now, we just got word.
The FDA is rejecting it.
The RTF letter is in the mail.
RTF?
Refuse To File.
Now, I'm so sorry your little Nazi friend is dead, but we've all got way bigger problems.
And I said "we."
Margo Chadwick?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go back to work.
Everybody, just stay calm, please.
May we?
Sure.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Jack?
Fucking detective said his death will probably be ruled a suicide.
I mean, the fucking Kraut jumped out the fucking window.
Does he think that I asked his secretary to give him a push?
You've been drinking, Margo?
Oh, yes, I have, and I'm not done yet.
Knocked a few back myself.
Yeah, well, we'd both better be sober in the morning.
Fucking Powell is flying in from Europe.
This shit is already getting worldwide press.
Go home, Jack.
Get some sleep.
Let me give you a head's up, you start selling.
Hey, Jimmy, what the hell is going on here?
And who the hell are they?
Mr. Armstrong.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Why are you shredding papers?
None of your business.
You answer to me!
But not today.
You remember that!
Now, you tell me what the hell is going on!
What the hell is...?
Jim...
You...
What the hell is wrong with you?
Open this door!
Jimmy, you'd better...
Jimmy!
All right.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
You want to play like that, fine.
Don't let this suit fool you, Jimmy!
You throw me out... and you'd better know this,
Powell and Chad are gonna hear this!
You rest assured of that, Jimmy!
February 10th.
Leland Powell named new CEO.
Took huge financial write-off... to restructure company.
Way more than needed.
Trying to make himself look good.
I don't trust him.
April 1st.
Powell lied at board meeting.
Reported $100 million in quarter profits when the real numbers are significantly less.
First quarter.
Powell borrowed 200 million from company account.
One hundred million went to pay margin calls.
Fifteen million to build private golf course.
Eighty-five million for silent-partner purchase of Prexelin stock.
May 9th.
FDA is fighting us on the results of testing.
Fear they will reject Prexelin.
With $300 million in profit losses projected, a downgrade is looming.
June 5th.
Powell tipped silent partner to FDA rejection.
They cash out $350 million in company stock.
Should call the Ethics Commission.
If only I was a whistle blower and weren't a coward.
Thank you, gentlemen... ladies.
Mr. Powell?
Sorry I'm late, sir.
John, so nice of you to join us.
Unfortunately, the meeting just ended.
I'll bring you up to speed in my office.
John, you see this crease between my eyebrows?
Yes, sir.
That comes from worry.
You're not going to deepen the crease, are you?
No, sir.
I'll try not to.
Shit!
I'm in Powell's doghouse.
You're in mine too.
I heard you saw the documentation retention party last night.
That's a very nice way of phrasing "destroying evidence."
He's locking down the 401Ks, Jack.
What?
Until further notice, employees won't be permitted to sell any personal stock in Progeia.
Leland feels, and the board agrees, that this will give a public perception that Progeia remains a rock-solid investment with unlimited growth potential, and, of course, Prexelin leading the way.
I thought the FDA...
Perception, Jack.
Business is perception.
Do you have any fucking idea how much money is gonna be made by the first company with the vaccine for AIDS?
Now, this is your boss making a sound business decision in the best interest of our company.
The American public is not stupid.
They're not gonna buy this.
The American public are a bunch of fucking morons.
You know it and I know it.
They will buy whatever we sell.
Now, look, Jack, are you with us?
Of course I'm with you.
But I want you to know for the record that I think locking up the 401Ks is a dumb-ass idea.
What the fuck do you care?
This doesn't affect us!
That's even worse!
I mean, for God's sakes!
Are you gonna go along with Powell on this?
Yes!
I'm falling right in line.
It's fucking necessary!
And I recommend you do the same.
Now get behind this, Jack.
We are family and family protects its own.
Get the fuck out of my office.
Fine.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Amen.
(DIALING)
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
Hello.
MAN:
Turn on New York 1.
What?
FEMALE REPORTER:
...Securities and Exchange Commission is launching a probe today into possible ethics violations at upstart pharmaceutical company Progeia.
Unnamed sources say the probe will be wide-ranging, and could even include an investigation into possible insider trading among several high-level Progeia executives.
Already reeling from the suicide of Dr. Herman Schiller,
Progeia is now facing a public-relations nightmare.
The company is trying to maintain its public trust in the face of pending FDA approval of its long-awaited HIV AIDS vaccine, Prexelin.
MAN:
I need an answer and I need it quick.
Are you gonna work with us?
Hey, who is this?
Hello?
Who is this?
(DIAL TONE)
Good morning, Gail.
I'm sorry, Mr. Armstrong.
Um...
I can't let you through.
What do you mean, you can't let me through?
I have strict orders.
Orders from who?
The management.
All right, Gail, look, whoever told you I can't go through, why don't you tell them to meet me in my office?
MARGO:
Jack.
Margo, look, I'm still vice-president of this company.
No, you were vice-president.
Friends of yours, huh?
Bad boy, Jack.
So, what?
Am I being terminated?
Actually, you terminated yourself.
That phone call... bad idea.
Oh, come on, Jack, don't get ugly here.
Go home.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Hey, Vada, I told you, man, I'm not going to some damn...
Damn.
Still fine.
Fatima?
Hey, Jack.
You gonna invite me in?
Oh, Jack, that's Alex.
Alex, say hello to Jack.
Hello, Jack.
Wow.
This is fantastic.
I love your new furniture.
See, Alex, I told you he had great taste.
Yeah, well, everything you bought for us,
I sent to the Salvation Army.
Fatima, what the hell are you doing here?
What?
I came to see an old friend.
You're not happy to see me?
Well, the last time I saw you, you fucked me up, down, and all the way around.
Honestly, Jack, that was, like, four years ago.
You're not over that yet?
Over it?
Woman, I was in love with you!
And I was in love with you.
But things change.
People change.
They evolve.
I evolved.
You evolved into bed with another woman?
You have never let me explain that.
So who is this?
Your new little plaything?
Jack, honestly.
Miss Brazilian bombshell, you the little flavor of the month?
Hey, cabrón.
I'm not Brazilian.
I'm Dominican.
So, what do you want, Fatima?
Why the hell are you here?
Actually, I'm glad you asked.
I want you to be the father of my child.
Jack?
This shit.
Hello?
Okay, do you remember when were in college and we both said that we wanted to be settled down by the time we were 31?
Well, I turn 31 next month.
I meant...together.
Well, that wouldn't have worked and you know it.
You snore, and you leave your boxers on the floor, and you turn the channel to Sports Center when I'm watching the news, and I...
It just wouldn't have worked, that's all.
So, what do you say?
What do I say?
Try a sperm bank.
Please, that is like shopping for Gucci at Wal-Mart.
There's no guarantee you're gonna get pregnant, and if you do, you don't know what you're getting.
His bio could say that he's 6'5", 220, with a Ph.D. from Oxford, and in reality, he smokes, he's bald, he's toothless, ugly, with an IQ of 65.
Try adoption.
Do you have any idea how hard it is for same-sex parents to adopt?
Come on, Jack, you gotta do this for me.
I don't gotta do a goddamn thing for you.
We'll pay you.
We?
Did Miss Manny Ramirez say "we"?
Yes.
Did I not mention to you that Alex and I would both like to get pregnant, together, at the same time.
We're feeling maternal.
JACK:
Oh, my God.
This is some sick shit.
FATIMA:
Who are you calling?
Bellevue, 8th floor, because you have lost your damn mind!
The average male has 66 million sperm per millimeter of semen.
All we're asking you for is two.
Dos.
That's not too much to ask for, is it?
How do you know it's the optimum time for the both of you to get pregnant?
Well, we both took our Donna saliva test.
And the time is right.
Besides, women who live together...
Straight or gay gay or straight, over time, will menstruate and ovulate on the same cycle.
T.M.G.D.I.
That's too much goddamn information.
Like I said...
we'll pay you.
We need that man-milk.
Money talks and bullshit walks.
In case you're wondering, that's 5000 dollars... in cash...
Each.
Apiece.
Per sperm recipient.
Wait.
Hold on.
But you're lesbians, right?
We're businesswomen.
We're businesswomen.
Jack, I want you to look this over.
Now, sweetie,
I know that you're clean, but for Alex's sake, we're gonna need a copy of your most-recent medical history.
I mean, a clean bill of health.
No HIV-1 or -2, Hepatitis B, or any of the other sexually transmitted diseases.
And, uh, Jack... no drugs.
And I hope you've got a full tank.
'Cause we want every gallon you've got.
Fatima, I can't do this.
Conference call's ready, sir.
Big five on line one.
Gentlemen, I know you're busy, so I'll be brief.
Through no fault of our own,
Progeia has come under fire from the SEC.
The culprit in this crisis is one of our most valued and trusted employees,
John Armstrong, for it was through his self-serving agenda that this wave of corruption and unethical business practices grew into a mushroom cloud right under our very... noses.
Gentlemen, this is a courtesy call.
Beware of Mr. Armstrong.
He's bright, charming, highly-driven and slick.
In my open-mindedness,
I do employ members of the darker nation.
I have no doubt that at this very moment, he's on his way over to seek employment with you.
I wouldn't want what's happened to Progeia to happen to you in your compassionate attempt to reach your minority quota.
We are a family, gentlemen.
And family protects its own.
Thank you.
Let's go, Margo.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)
Quiet down.
Excuse me.
Can I have your attention, please?
(CHATTERING QUIETS)
On behalf of myself and the board of directors,
I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to address you.
Many of you were a lot wealthier in the past week, but now because of a sudden dip in Progeia stock, you are concerned about the college education for your kids, maybe the mortgage on your house,
your retirement fund, I mean, whatever it may be, and for that I'm truly, incredibly... deeply sorry.
But we are going to get it back.
Ahem.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to know if you are, uh... on crack?
If so, that's okay, because that would help to explain a lot.
If you're not, you might want to start, because it's gonna be a long time before any of us ever trust you again.
Is fucking Enron or Worldcom hiring?
Sir, we are all under a lot of strain here, and, of course, we're still mourning the loss of our beloved colleague,
Dr. Schiller,
But I do appreciate your honest comments.
One last thing I would like to add before I get back to work for you, and you, and you, and you, to bring this stock back up to where it belongs...
Whoo!
There is no truth to the rumors about the unethical behavior of John Henry Armstrong.
He remains, still, a valued, vital asset to this company.
Despite the FDA, we firmly believe that Prexelin will end the scourge of AIDS on this planet.
That is our mission, gentlemen... and ladies.
God bless you all, and God bless America.
WOMAN:
This is outrageous!
(WORKERS CLAMORING ANGRILY)
MAN:
I like a little Vaseline when I'm getting fucked.
(PUNCHING BUTTONS)
(BEEPING)
Come on.
What?
What?
Where's my card?
Mr. Armstrong, how are you today?
I'll be better if you can give me some answers.
Well, I will do my best.
Please, be seated.
What can I do to help you?
Well, Mr. Jennings,
I just came from the ATM where it ate my card.
Mr. Armstrong, I'll take care of that right away.
Ay!
Good.
So, what you need is the bank manager to help you out.
Let's see what I can do here.
Mental midgets running around out there, I...
Well, let me just override this.
It seems as if there's some sort of a, uh...
Is everything okay?
Mr. Armstrong, I'll be right back.
Is there something wrong?
Back in a jiffy.
Hey, can I talk to you...?
John, please be seated.
This is highly irregular.
There seems to be a small problem.
Well, what kind of small problem, Clive?
John, actually, you might say it's a big problem.
Give me a straight answer.
John, your account is frozen.
What?
!
Your account, assets, everything.
Frozen.
I've been all around this city trying to get interviews with people who were trying to steal me from Progeia and now they won't even answer my phone calls!
Now, I want my money and with the quickness!
No reason to raise your voice.
This is a bank.
The motherfuck, a bank!
Now, I want my money right now!
Calm down, please.
No, fuck calm down!
Look, I'm about to go Mike Tyson and postal up in this bitch if you don't give me my money!
All right?
Security!
I worked hard for my money!
I can't give you the money!
I went to Harvard and Wharton.
I'll sue!
I'll sue you!
You don't fucking know who you're messing with!
I'm John Henry Armstrong!
(♪)
(JACK GRUNTING, MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)
Take my money!
(CONTINUES MUTTERING)
Come back and take everything!
This form says that I waive all my parental rights.
(SIGHS)
Well, of course so, silly man.
Did you think you were gonna be the dad?
Look, I'm sorry.
I'd like to help you out, but I can't do this.
Really?
Yes, really.
'Cause on the NiggerNet, it says that you just got canned and that your current net worth is somewhere between zero and the gross national debt.
Now, you're gonna need some serious cash flow if you plan on continuing this lifestyle.
Do we get the sperm or not?
Sign it.
Fine.
Good.
Now, drop your drawers and let's get to work.
Okay.
Okay, now, what the hell is this?
What?
That.
It's a turkey baster.
You're not poking that thing inside of me.
I don't do dick.
Don't look at me.
I want it the old-fashioned way.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
No!
Alex.
You're not!
(BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Listen to me.
You promised.
I will do this the way that I want to do it.
Fat, you promised me.
I know what I promised.
So you want to do this?
It is a woman's prerogative to change her mind.
Did you come here to make a baby or did you come here to get...
You know what?
Forget it.
I knew...
I knew you'd get it twisted and flip the switch on me.
All right.
Fucking unbelievable.
I'll wait in the living room.
Good.
(FATIMA MOANING)
(♪)
(RINGING BUZZER)
You woke Kwame.
I'm sorry.
Jack, man, do you realize that Lucy and I haven't had a full night's sleep since the baby was born?
How is Lucy?
Jack, do you still have a key to this house?
Yeah.
Next time, please use it.
You're not in trouble, are you?
Are you kidding?
Choir boy couldn't spell trouble if you spotted him the T-R-O.
No, Mama, I'm fine.
I'm not in any trouble.
I did lose my job, though.
You lost your job?
I don't believe it.
You ain't been unemployed since you were 14.
Jack, what happened?
Good night, you all.
Good night, Lucy.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Come tell me about it.
How on earth did you lose your job?
I don't know.
So I reported it.
I knew I should've just let it go, but, Mom...it affected too many people.
Ethics violations?
Well... tell the truth, shame the devil.
I think you did the right thing.
Right thing?
I only caused an SEC investigation, lost my job, and ruined my entire career.
Seems like doing right just ruined my life.
Why don't you go downstairs and talk to G about it.
Which one of theses fools jumped out the window?
He did.
And he's not a fool.
He was a great man.
So that's the story, Dad.
I think I messed up.
No, you did good, son.
You just gotta deal, now.
No time for the bullshit.
How are you doing?
Don't worry about me.
You stay strong... 'cause these motherfuckers are gonna come after your natural black ass.
You think so?
Oh, shit, yeah.
You fucked with the money.
It's gonna be cold-blooded.
How was your last checkup, Dad?
Phew.
This diabetes is a bitch.
My sugar count's up.
Me and your mama, oh, boy.
It's rough, man.
Mama.
Look, I don't blame your mother.
I just feel bad that I'm holding her back.
Nobody wants to be a burden.
How can the great Geronimo Armstrong be a burden?
Shit, your mama would have left my diabetic ass a long time ago if I wasn't all fucked up.
That's the only thing that keeps her here.
So I just keep to myself down here in the basement and try to stay out of the way.
Since I don't have a gig anymore,
I'll come by and spend more time with you.
No, you better take care of your own ass, man.
I'm telling you, them motherfuckers don't play when you start fucking with the money.
All right?
If I was you...
I would get some legal representation with the quickness.
Hey, Doak.
Ça va?
Ça va.
Et toi?
Uh, Mr. Armstrong...
Uh, comment on dit en anglais?
There are gentlemen here to see you.
I don't know why.
Mr. Armstrong, Agent Flood,
Securities and Exchange Commission.
You have now been served.
(CHUCKLES)
Maybe it's good news.
My father, Geronimo Armstrong, highly recommended you.
Tell your father hello for me.
So, what I need from you now is for you to paint the picture.
Tell me the entire story.
Please don't leave anything out.
And you might want to check with me before you speak with anyone else.
Lastly, all that I ask is that you do not ever lie to me.
Do you understand, Mr. Armstrong?
I will never lie to you.
Look at this mess I'm stuck in with you.
Just let it rest.
Jesus Christmas!
Jesus Christmas, I wish I could rest, instead of laying up here being nurse to you.
I wish I was some place else.
I never asked you to be no goddamned nurse!
Did I?
What do you want me to do?
You think I asked the Good Lord to give me diabetes?
Is that what you think?
Why bring up the Lord?
Why don't you just leave?
No, I ain't leaving.
You leave.
This is my house.
And when go, who's gonna take care of you?
You?
Jamal?
Hasn't he got a wife and a new baby?
And I know you don't think your son, Jack, is thinking about helping you, because all he got on his mind is money.
GERONIMO:
The only thing that'll make you happy is when they've amputated both of my legs.
So why don't you just go get a saw, and save the doctor a whole lot of trouble.
It'll be a lot cheaper, Lottie!
Just cut them off!
LOTTIE:
Well, get a goddamn knife and I fucking will!
Stop it!
Get a knife!
I don't know what to do anymore.
JACK:
You know he's ill.
LOTTIE:
He's driving me crazy.
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have heard that.
What's up, man?
Hey.
Around here with all that screaming and fussing?
Huh?
Yeah, man, it's...
Heh.
This arguing, man, it's, like, bad for my high blood pressure.
Yes, it is.
Sorry you had to hear that, son.
It ain't nothing new.
Me and Jamal used to wake up to the sound of you and Mama screaming at each other, fighting.
Yeah, for that I'm ashamed, but, man, you know...
between a man and a woman... (CHUCKLES)
But believe it or not, me and your mother still love each other deeply.
(CHUCKLES)
You believe that?
We do love each other deeply.
I know, I know.
That's that funny, peculiar love.
That's what that is.
But it's real.
You were right about that other thing.
They coming at you already, huh?
Froze all my money.
Nobody will hire me.
The SEC served me papers.
That's cold-blooded, man.
Frank Wills.
Who?
You are Frank Wills, straight up.
Who was he?
He was a security guard that discovered the Watergate break-in.
That opened the country's eyes to government corruption that led all the way up to Nixon.
He saved us from a bunch of crooked politicians.
(CHUCKLES)
But what did America do to him?
They chewed him up and they spit him out.
Frank Wills died destitute at the age of 52.
No job, no nothing.
That's what they do to you, son.
First, they break you... then they kill you.
(♪)
MAN:
Dispatch.
Yeah, this is Watergate Security, Wills,
Tower B. Go ahead, Wills.
There's a possible break-in at 2510 Virginia Avenue NW.
Perpetrators may still be on the premises.
Could you send somebody over here, please?
Copy that.
D.C. police are on the way.
Thank you.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
All right Wills, reach for the sky!
Never should've found duct tape on the door.
Never should've made that call.
Now your life is ruined.
We'll run you out of town.
You'll never work again.
I, however, John Dean, will make millions on the lecture circuit.
I, G. Gordon Liddy, will have my own nationally-syndicated radio show.
I, John Erlichman, will retire from politics and become a best-selling novelist.
I, H.R. Haldeman, will just stay beautiful and live in Santa Barbara.
What about all this?
What about this tape?
Damn it!
I told them I didn't erase that stupid tape!
It was already defective!
No, goddamn it, I meant this tape!
Oh.
Sorry.
Kill the son of a bitch!
What?
You can't kill me, man!
I did the right thing!
I blew the whistle!
I'm Jeb Stuart Magruder... and you're nobody, Wills.
We can kill a nobody.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, we do it all the time.
What about all these crooks?
All the President's men?
NIXON:
Ah, they're all white.
I mean, "all right."
Uh, diplomatic immunity.
Mr. President.
I got here as fast as I could.
I'm Oliver North.
(CHUCKLES)
(HOOTING, FIRING GUNS)
NIXON:
Four more years!
(DOORBELL RINGS)
I know how to increase your cash flow.
Darling, would you take the ladies inside?
Absolutely.
Good evening, Jack.
Hey...
Ah!
Hello, my darling.
'Kay.
Hmm.
How are you?
I'm...fine.
How are you?
Good.
Good.
Good.
Fatima, what are you doing here?
Who the hell are these women?
Relax, they're friends of mine.
What kind of friends?
Lesbie friends, all right?
They are all highly educated, highly successful businesswomen.
They have achieved the American dream... almost.
And that is where you come in.
Me?
Yes.
You see, they... would like for you to be their child's daddy.
Fatima, have you lost your damn mind?
They're willing to pay $10,000 each.
And all I want is ten percent.
Ten percent?
Finders fee.
Congratulations are in order.
Mm.
I'm pregnant.
Mwah.
Ladies, I think we should begin.
Thank you all for coming.
Nadiyah... would you like to start?
Okay.
I've tried adopting,
Vietnamese, Chinese...
Haitian, Croatian, Senegalese, and...
I kept getting the runaround.
Twice, I went to the airport to meet my baby's plane, only to find that my baby wasn't on it.
I've now spent over $50,000 in adoption fees, and I just...
I mean, I can't go through that heartache again.
This time, I'm having this baby on my own.
Or...
I mean, with you, I guess.
However that thing goes.
Oh, gosh.
Um, thank you.
FATIMA:
Thanks.
(APPLAUSE) WOMAN:
Thank you.
Oni?
I'm Oni Woo.
Nice to meet you.
Um, background's very important to me, education, genealogy... hair, muscle definition, things like that.
And what's his IQ level?
Are there any health issues?
That's why fertility clinics never appealed to me.
So please...be gentle.
Don't let me down, okay?
Okay.
I'll try.
FATIMA:
That was beautiful.
(APPLAUSE)
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
I mean, I'm hating to be the Wicked Bitch of the Eastside Riders, heh...
Oh, by the way, I'm Evelyn.
Then again, you all already knew that.
Excuse my "skepticalism,"
but what's a Wharton University college grad doing trying to knock up a bunch of glam dykes at 10 G's a pop?
That's an excellent question, Evelyn.
Preach.
It's a sideline occupation for an ever-changing economy.
Greater cash flow gives our man Jack here greater investment versatility.
While our moderate, fixed fertilization rates give women such as ourselves better access to a safe, comfortable environment within which we can all pursue our personal goals of procreation.
Good answer.
I just want to know, is he circumcised?
Because if he's not circumcised, I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere near him.
Relax, Rachel, he's very circumcised.
Aren't you, Jack?
You know that I am, Fatima.
Excuse me.
What's circumcised?
Baby, don't worry about it.
I'll explain it to you later.
FATIMA:
Okay.
Um...
Ah!
Song.
We have not heard from you.
Is there something that you would like to add?
(APPLAUSE)
Go, Song!
Right.
Pretty girl.
I'm Song Gokta.
Hi.
Hi, Song.
I've never been with a man before.
A lot of us haven't been with a man before, ladies.
Is it painful?
FATIMA:
Jack is very gentle.
Right, Jack?
I am?
I am.
I'm, like...soft.
Does he believe in God?
A higher being?
Does he have a history of mental illness in his family?
Something ain't right in the eyes.
Does he have any other kids?
I'd like to look at them.
I'm not gonna take too much more of this.
Ladies, any other questions you have,
I'm sure can be answered in the packets you've received.
So I need to know, who's in?
I am.
Good.
Good.
Well, now would be a good time for financial transactions.
Thank you, Evelyn.
Everyone, please sign your donor waiver forms.
Jack, you go and get ready.
What?
You mean now?
Of course, now.
These women are ovulating.
Look, I'm sorry,
I hate to be a spoilsport here, but in today's tough economy, 10,000 bucks is a lot of money.
What are you saying?
$10,000 is $10,000.
And I would like to see with my own two peepers what I'm paying for before I fork over $10,000.
She does have a point.
That's what's up.
I'm saying.
A damn good point.
Jack.
Jack, what?
Disrobe.
Show us your beautiful body.
Oh, no!
No!
Hell, no!
Just strip, bitch.
Are you serious?
These women have paid you quite a bit of money.
Jack, you're not shy?
Can you drop your drawers, please?
(GIGGLES)
Oh...
Jack, we have to see your privates.
Come on, nigga, show us your tube steak, your man-stick.
Sold.
FATIMA:
Can you rotate slowly so everybody can get a good look?
EVELYN:
Now you know what it feels like to be a sexual object.
Mm-hm.
Thank you, Rachael.
Damn!
Where do I sign?
NADIYAH:
I'll pay for that.
EVELYN:
Oh, yeah.
Mm.
Um...
Is that thing gonna hurt?
Because, um...
You'll be fine.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's...
Hold on one minute.
Just one minute.
Okay?
(MUNCHING SOUNDS)
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)
Eat.
In my culture, if we eat chicken feet,
I will have a boy.
The boy grow up, will run fast.
Eat.
EVELYN:
Calm down, calm down, ladies and gentlemen.
I want to send this one out right now... to all the men out there.
I know you all remember my, um, 1998 platinum-selling CD,

Wait a minute.
Let me see these nails.
No, this is...
No, no.
We're gonna have to cut your nails.
I want you to warm me up first.
I don't want you just sticking that thing in me.
Let me get a clipper.
What?
It's disgusting.
Hi.
Heh.
Ow!
Did you wash it?
Can I touch it?
Can I squeeze?
(WOMEN GASPING, SIGHING)
You have to open your legs, okay?
Oh, goodness.
Ooh!
(MOANS)
Okay, just get your hand off my tit and focus.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Oh, wait.
That's good.
(MOANING)
(CHANTING SOFTLY)
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Who are you talking to?
Shh.
Awakening the chi.
Just try to relax and breathe.
Okay?
Oh, shit!
Call me a bitch, huh?
Okay.
EVELYN:
You fucking stallion, motherfucker!
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
Come on!
(RISING CRIES OF PASSION)
Hurry up, now!
(JACK GRUNTS)
God...damn.
You got it?
You okay?
Yeah.
You're sweating on me.
(♪)
Oh!
Whoa!
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
You are a cash cow.
(CHUCKLES)
Now, things didn't quite work out with Alex, so I'm going to need some more of that man-milk.
Thank you.
JACK:
Yo, Vada, I got a new name for Fatima.
Remember that crazy brother from the XFL?
Yeah, that fake NFL defunct league.
Right.
Well, Fatima's new name is She Hate Me.
Oh, snap!
Yo, when I saw "He Hate Me"
on the back of that brother's jersey, the first thing I thought,
I know his moms didn't name him that.
And the second thing I thought was it was genius, man.
Pure genius.
What's his name again?
Rod Smart.
Right.
Where's he at?
In the NFL, man, running back kicks and punt returns for the Carolina Panthers.
Rod Smart, "He Hate Me."
Fatima, "She Hate Me."
Like Mary J. be singing that "hateration" and "holleration" shit
Right.
Mary be making up some motherfucking words.
For real.
Yo but, Fatima, she doesn't feel that way about you.
She told me so.
Told you?
What, you been holding out on me?
Nah.
When you refused to call her back, she called me.
She was like,
"Vada could you hook me up with Jack?" and...
I told Fatima...
She Hate Me.
She Hate Me that I couldn't do that.
Right.
I can't believe this, man.
I thought we was tight.
Nigga, man, we tighter than two titties in a push-up bra, man.
You know what?
What?
Her friend was fine.
Meaning what?
Meaning I can't really blame Fat...
She Hate Me.
She Hate Me.
Salut, Doak.
Fatima, how are you?
Fine?
Ça va, Doak.
Et toi?
Ça va, ça va.
Super bien.
He's expecting us.
Okay, no problem.
Can I have your number?
Oh, please, please.
Your number.
Doris Mitchell.
Michele Prawn.
Jo Day.
Norman Grahm.
Karen Brockner.
There they are, Jack.
Ready for round two?
(♪)
Jack?
Oh, God.
What?
Hi.
$110,000 in three nights.
I bet you never did that at Progeia.
Ah, ah!
This is your 45 large for tonight... and this is my five.
How come your girlfriend's not here?
You do know her name.
Girlfriend.
Alex... is not speaking to me.
Why not?
Because I'm pregnant and she's not.
Jack do you know what October 11th is?
Someone's birthday?
I mean, I know it's not our wedding anniversary, because...
we don't have one.
October 11th is National Coming Out Day.
I wanted you to know.
Know what?
That you're bi, lesbian or straight?
More than that.
Damn, you sure waited a long time to tell me.
I mean, how long have you known?
Probably since high school, but I was in denial, and I don't mean a river in Egypt.
I just always figured it would pass over me.
A phase?
Mm-hmm, but it doesn't work that way.
I don't believe in this gay-gene shit.
I am not trying to have a deep, scientific conversation with you.
I just finally figured out that this is who I am.
And who is that?
Bi or lesbian?
Why do I have to put myself in a box?
Because that's the way it is.
Either you're bi, lesbian or straight.
Pick one.
Withholding that from you was a betrayal.
I was in love with you.
I mean, do you remember that we were engaged to be married?
I didn't want to risk losing you.
I didn't have the heart to tell you right away, and I know that you may not believe this, but...
You never told me her name.
It doesn't matter.
I wanna know her name.
What difference does it make?
You haven't changed one bit.
That night was the first time I ever had sex with a woman.
Stop lying.
That is true!
I mean, I had fooled around before, kissing and whatnot, but I swear on our unborn child.
You were reckless.
I had to find out before we tied the knot.
I bet your friend with no name just...seduced you.
I know how these lesbians are.
They're like vultures.
They're worse than men.
As soon as they see somebody they want to fuck, they're just on your back.
They're so damn persistent.
I know she was just on you until you were like,
"Fuck it, I'll just give you the panties."
You may not like to hear this, but I pursued her, not the other way around.
So you mean to tell me... that you decided to start experimenting with your sexual orientation while our wedding invitations were in the mail...
John Henry to both our family and friends?
I am not proud of it.
I mean, what the fuck, Fatima?
!
What about us?
I had to find out.
You would have preferred for me to have told you after we're married?
What would you have said if I told you when you proposed?
Come on.
I'm thinking.
I know you.
I know your pride.
You're a man.
You're right.
And I'm sorry, but I am a man.
There's a lot of men who would have seen that and been thrilled.
Well, there's also a lot of so-called straight men going around fucking other men in the culo, coming home, bringing AIDS to their wives and girlfriends.
Oh!
It is exactly that kind of ignorant homophobia that made me know that you weren't ready.
Homophobia?
Yes!
Fatima, I deserved a choice!
And you fucking took that away from me by not being honest.
I'm sorry.
I caused you a great deal of pain and embarrassment.
What did you learn in this close encounter with the woman with no name?
You really want to know?
Yes.
You want me to say it?
Fatima, please.
Yes.
I...
love...pussy...too.
Are you happy now?
Actually, I'm very sad.
Well, you shouldn't be, because... you will see that, in the end,
I did you a very big favor.
You and I will always be connected because I'm having your child.
I read somewhere that, uh... women... are more likely to cheat when ovulating.
Men are more likely to cheat when breathing.
Good night, Jack.
Oh, Fatima!
(WOMEN MOANING)
Fatima, te gusta!
(WOMEN MOANING, SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
(CRIES OF ECSTASY)
Excuse me.
Who the fuck is this?
What are you doing here?
Who the fuck is this?
What are you doing in this shit?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Get your hands off me.
Is this your shit?
Huh?
Is this your shit?
Get your fucking shit and get out of here!
Get your shit!
What the fuck you looking at?
Jack, stop!
(SOBS)
Wha...?
Come here.
Come here.
Get off of me!
We were getting married.
FATIMA:
Jack?
Jack?
(DOOR SLAMS)
(ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPING)
FATIMA:
Jack, listen, I might be running a little late, so I'm gonna need you to start without me.
So remember, everybody pays up front.
Cash.
No checks.
And, uh, don't expect a repeat of the other night, because these ladies are...
a little different.
Sorry.
(IN UNISON) We're here to see Mr. Armstrong.
All of us?
(TOGETHER) All of you.
All of you, yes.
Yes.
Are you rapper?
Like, uh, Queen Latifah?
No.
No?
You too?
You go to the...
Mr. Armstrong?
Yes, I do.
Can we go now?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, go.
Hey, uh, can I have your number?
Or can I kiss you?
Please?
Eh?
I am the assistant of Mr. Armstrong.
Really.
I'm producer of Mr. Armstrong.
Real...
No problem.
Whoo!
No...
No problem!
Talofa, Jack.
I'm Leilani.
I hope you got a strong back.
Unh!
Point Guard.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm gonna back you down, then post you up.
(SMACKS JACK)
Bitch boy.
Bitch boy?
Damn.
(♪)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
That's it.
(MUFFLED SPEECH)
I can't breathe.
Help me.
I...can't...breathe.
Shut up!
You're killing me.
Shut up!
You're hurting...
Unh!
(CHOKING)
Almost there.
Almost there!
Almost there!
My girlfriend says if I come...
Mm-hm.
...it increases my chances of conception.
What is that, some new kind of medical fact?
I've never heard of that before.
I'm not sure, but, uh... this should be fun, right?
Okay.
Plug it in.
(WOMAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(WOMAN AND JACK MOANING)
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
What's my name?
Say it!
Say it!
JACK:
I don't know your name!
That's right.
We haven't been introduced.
Hi.
I'm Ticha.
JACK:
Ticha!
(TICHA SCREAMS)
Ticha!
(♪)
You gonna have to come back tomorrow.
I'm sorry, but I don't have anything left.
See, you made that up.
Trust me.
You have my $10,000, and I'm not coming back tomorrow, so I don't know what you gonna have to do...
Ahem.
But you gonna have to do something, so...
That's pitiful.
It's been a long day.
So if you come back tomorrow, I'm sure it'll all be okay.
You have my money.
I don't know if you need to go watch porno flicks, call Fatima, Alex, somebody, have some phone sex.
Whatever you need to do, you need to get it up.
Get this thing up!
Okay?
Ow!
Okay!
You know, women don't even have this problem.
So, what you trying to say?
You need some of these?
I don't know.
Here.
Take some of these.
Or maybe you need some more Red Bull.
Here.
Do what you need to do, okay?
Because I need to get pregnant.
Well, give me my, uh, horny goat weed.
(♪)
What are you doing here?
I want my $5000 worth.
Oh, Alex, come on.
I want my $5000 worth, okay?
Look, what are you doing?
I wish I could do this by myself... without a man.
I wish I could take care of Fat, get her pregnant.
But I can't.
I can't even get myself pregnant.
So...we need you.
I need you, okay?
I need you.
Alex, come on, stop it.
Alex, Alex, come...
Alex.
Alex.
What's wrong with you?
I don't even feel like a woman.
You've managed to impregnate everyone in the world but me.
That's just wrong.
Don't...
Excuse me for being blunt... but we see you as dick, balls and sperm.
So come on, let's do the damn thing.
Can you please close the door?
(♪)
(ALEX AND JACK MOANING)
Jack's fast asleep.
Look, I got a lot of shit on my mind, all right?
Yeah, right.
More like too much coochie on your dick.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means you'd better get your shit together and quit fucking around.
You know God don't like ugly.
Oh, so now I'm ugly?
Your deeds, baby.
You ugly in your deeds.
The Bible ain't say nothing about Adam and Eve and Eve.
That's enough, Jamal, all right?
I didn't come out here for no fucking sermon!
Would you rather hear Mama's?
No.
Then shut the fuck up and listen to mine!
Now, look...
I'm just a cameraman... and I ain't got a magic-wand dick like you got, so, what do I know, right?
But I'm telling you...
I've been thinking hard on this, and spiritually, morally, this shit ain't cool.
Aw, damn!
No, no, no, I'm serious, man.
Knocking up a bunch of lesbians, that's some freaky shit.
Now, what happens if you get them all pregnant, huh?
I mean, how many kids you gonna have?
Twelve or so.
Wha...?
.
A dozen?
Man, Bill Gates is one of the richest motherfuckers on earth.
He only got one.
How the hell you gonna raise 12 kids?
Look, I don't have to.
I signed a donor agreement form.
I don't have to feed them, house them, send them to school.
I don't have to do nothing.
For real?
For real.
Phew.
Good deal.
No shit.
No, wait.
Now, hell.
Now, that's some bullshit!
(SIGHS) Look, Jack...
Men provide for their families, even if it's just by being there.
I mean, kids need their father.
And that's something you ought to know because we have one of the best.
Now, look, you're my brother.
I love you.
But take some advice from me.
Get a vasectomy, call it a day.
Oh, come on, man.
Shut up.
Snip!
Hey, Jack, snip!
You hungry?
Not really.
I'm cooking dinner, so...
you're going to eat.
Why did you go back to Jack's apartment?
I thought you didn't like dick.
I don't.
How was I supposed to know the artificial insemination wouldn't work, Fat... three times?
Besides, this whole thing was your idea, so don't empiece conmigo.
I'm not starting with you.
Yes, you are.
You got this whole thing about us getting pregnant at the same time.
I didn't think of that, Mami, you did.
You wanted it, so I went along.
I supported you.
I've been supporting you since day one.
I don't want you to do this for support.
I want you to do this because you want to have a baby, because you want to start our family together, because you want that.
That's what I want.
So really, Fat, why are you bugging me about me and Jack?
Why were you at Jack's house?
We have business with him.
That late at night?
Really?
(WHISPERS) Business.
What were you doing there?
You are so fucked up.
You're always flipping things.
No.
Yes.
No.
That's not what this is about.
Yes.
What were you doing there?
What were you doing there?
!
I know who I am.
I know why I was there.
And I was there to get pregnant.
You...
You haven't even come out to your parents.
I am not you!
Yes.
And don't ask me questions that you don't want to know the answers to.
Do you want to be with him?
I still have feelings for him... but I want to be with you.
This is good, me and you, Fat... but add some good dick to the equation and it changes everything.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Nothing...
Nothing...
Jack has not come between us.
I saw you in his apartment, and now you're telling me you have feelings for him?
Yes.
He's come between us.
So why don't you go sit down and eat.
Dinner's ready.
(SNIFFLES)
Get off me.
Get off me.
Stop it, if you don't mean it.
You sure you know Get off me.
what you're doing?
Yeah, man.
You gave me the inspiration for it.
No, no.
I didn't have nothing to do with this.
Don't put this shit on me.
WOMAN:
Hi.
Welcome to Avgo.
May I help you?
Uh, yeah.
My name is Vada Huff.
I have a 1:00 appointment.
Oh.
Okay.
And there you are.
I'm Terri.
And your name?
Oh, not me.
I'm just along for the ride, moral support for my boy.
Well, let us know if you change your mind.
Here.
Please, take our brochure.
Here at Avgo, we can always use a good specimen.
Mr. Huff?
Yeah, you can call me Vada.
Mr. Huff.
Please follow me.
Fill this out.
And this is...?
That is a potential donor questionnaire.
Very simple.
I'll be back when you're done.
Mm, mm, mm.
Shorty's a jump-off for real, B.
For real.
So how much they pay?
Um, $60 a specimen or something like that.
Not as much as you're getting, but, uh, you gotta pass the mustard.
What, you afraid they're not up to snuff?
(CHUCKLES) Are you crazy, man?
I got mad Mark Spitz sperm.
My shits be swimming like Olympic gold medalists, man.
How much you think Michael Jordan would get for his sperm?
Come on, man, I don't know.
What about Shaq, Bruce Springsteen,
Derek Jeter, Tom Cruise...
Willie Mays, Brando, Jagger, James Brown...
Denzel, Ali?
Even Kobe?
You can't put a price on that, Vada.
A price could be put on anything, man.
You doing it.
So, what about the dead cats?
Ellington, Miles, Van Gogh,
Armstrong, Mark Twain, Sinatra, Mozart,
Coltrane, Picasso, Shakespeare, Da Vinci, even Jesus of Nazareth, man.
You could get a whole lot of money for that.
Money for what, Vada?
To buy their specimen if you could.
So if you could, you know, pay for sperm... you could pay for eggs.
Cleopatra, Jackie O., Billie Holliday,
Nina Simone, Ella, Marilyn Monroe,
Mother Teresa, Grace Kelly, or Dorothy Dandridge.
How much would they go for?
Vada, that's not some shit I ever thought about in my entire life.
Well, then, maybe you should start, then.
Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Aretha?
Halle,
Venus and Serena...
Mm.
Beyonce...
Them tender, fresh, fertile young eggs.
Shits would be at a premium.
You crazy as a motherfucker.
Smile if you want, but watch.
All done?
Yes, Terri.
We need a sample.
Yes, Terri.
Follow me.
I'll take you to the ejactorium.
The what?
The ejactorium.
It's just a private room.
Okay.
I'm out, kid.
Have fun, man.
VADA:
Damn!
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on!
Go ahead.
What you...?
You just walked in there!
The correct terminology is Sperm Retention Overload Backup.
The correct terminology is 30-second motherfucker who can't get no ass because he nut too fast.
Oh, come on, man, get that nasty Mark Spitz shit away from me.
It's quality, not quantity.
Oh.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
That's a damn shame.
VADA:
I've just got to take my vitamins.
MARGO:
Jack?
Look, I'm sorry I didn't come and talk to you sooner.
I just didn't want to stick my neck out.
Oh, I see.
It's the new game called High-Tech Lynching.
It's not a game.
Progeia's future's on the line.
Powell won't stop at anything to protect it.
But even if that means destroying people's lives in the process?
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
I fit the profile.
Young, aggressive, recently fired, disgruntled, angry, black.
Oh the SEC's gonna love this, right?
This isn't about race and you know it.
Oh, I know.
It's about who goes to prison and who doesn't, baby.
What's this I hear about you making babies now?
Hmm?
I was pregnant once...
Well, twice, actually, but the first time didn't really count.
The second time, I lost the baby about three months in.
I didn't expect it of myself, but I actually loved everything about being pregnant... even the morning sickness... (CHUCKLES) ...even though my ex-husband was a total fucking asshole...prick.
Heh.
He divorced me after I started making twice as much as he did.
I guess I always thought I'd take time off, try again... but...career.
What do you think, Jack?
You're the expert here.
Do you think I'm too old to have a baby?
Older women are having healthy babies every day.
I know, but right now, I'm lacking the main ingredient.
What do you charge?
I need for you... to do me a favor.
Okay...
I think.
I need for you to give this to Powell for me.
Please.
How did you know about the babies?
How we know is not what's important.
That we know is what should scare the shit out of you.
You promise me to be careful, Jack.
Promise me.
I promise.
Cheers.
FATIMA:
You are actually guaranteed through the fourth visit.
If you're not pregnant by the end of the fourth visit, we will refund the entire amount.
(DOOR OPENS) Ah!
That is him.
Hello, sweetheart.
Doak let us in.
We were expecting five women, but we only have four because one stood us up.
Well, give them their money back.
Why?
Sorry, ladies, the shop's closed.
Jack, wait.
Uh, it's that time of the month.
Excuse me.
Jack...
JACK:
Get out of my house.
Jack...
Fatima, leave.
Sweetie?
Hey.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Excuse me.
Lady, did you just ring my doorbell?
I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.
(SNIFFLES)
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I'm looking for a...
John...
Henry...
Armstrong.
Fatima sent you, right?
Fatima, yeah.
She asked me if I wanted to go to this pregnancy party.
Mind you, I never said I would.
I said I would think about it.
Oh, God, my father's gonna kill me.
Maybe you shouldn't do it.
He's gonna kill me if I don't do it.
I really don't understand.
I was raised Roman Catholic... and I'm the only daughter of a very important man.
I feel like such a whore.
There's only one ho sitting here... and it sure as hell isn't you.
Thanks.
I feel a lot better.
You made up my mind.
I'm gonna do it.
Do what?
Have a kid.
Go ahead, make me a baby.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady.
Look...
I don't mean to disappoint you, but I'm not doing that anymore.
Why not?
You've got something against Italians?
We're not all in the Mob, you know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look, slow your roll.
It's not like that at all.
It's a spiritual thing.
It's morals, ethics.
Why do men have to be so... complicati?
You talking about men in general or someone in particular?
My father.
Hmm.
He wants grandkids.
Fine.
Crazy thing is, I want babies too.
I've wanted them since I was a kid.
There must be someone you know, someone who you feel comfortable with.
I feel comfortable right here.
Yeah, but you don't know me.
I was gonna try a sperm bank or a fertility clinic, but then I read about that doctor, that Cecil B. Jacobson... who impregnated 70 of his own unknowing patients with his own sperm.
So I said, "Forget about it."
So...you see?
This is the only way.
Please?
Here.
(♪)
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, my God.
I felt it.
Felt what?
Your sperm...
just met my egg.
Conception, Jack.
I'm pregnant... (GASPS) ...with twins.
I'm sorry, but I don't think it's possible to feel the moment of conception.
Trust me.
I'm very sensitive.
I'll let you know what it is.
You know, boy, girl.
Both.
Thank you, Jack.
What's that?
I got it from Jack.
Jack?
Jack.
Read it.
"Dear Mr. Powell...
How deep is your crease?"
Sex and scandal always make front-page news.
Margo, your problem is, you...
You're too emotional.
Don't lose your edge.
MAN:
Really good sauce.
MAN 2:
Yeah, it was.
Mafia...
I still don't understand why you did it.
We agreed on artificial insemination.
Have a stiff drink.

I had to wait for Gia.
Yes, Gia, Gia.
It's always Gia.
Your mother, God rest her soul, went to her grave thinking you were sick in the head...
Thank you.
...that the Devil had sneaked into your soul.
Fucking balls on this one, huh?
Fucking balls on this one.
ROCCO:
Not bad-looking for a dyke.
(GRUNTS)
You know, I'm trying to be understanding to this way of life, but...it's not easy for me.
I love her.
I read books.
I even talked to a priest who I cannot stand talking to.
Why do you choose to rub it in my face?
We're as discreet as possible.
We never, never, ever have disrespected you.
Thanks.
So, what's the news?
I'm pregnant.
What you've always wanted.
A grandchild...
maybe twins.
I can't believe it.
I'm...
I'm very happy... for you...
and, uh, your partner.
I'm very happy.
Who's the father?
He's a very nice, kind, warm... professional, intelligent, MBA... and AA.
AA?
Afro-American.
A colored?
Yes, Daddy.
Well, that's good.
Grazie, Papino.
Okay.
Mio papino.
Not for nothing, if the old man didn't give the hands-off, you would have caught a hell of a beating.
Or worse.
Hey, what's worse?
You don't ever want to find out.
How did you meet my cousin Simona?
She just showed up at my door.
I never seen her before in my life.
Get the fuck out of here.
You fucking with me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not lying, man.
You better be on the up and up.
I am.
So help me God.
You know, I believe him.
I mean, these lesbian muff-divers, they'll do anything, right or wrong.
No?
You're right.
These carpet munchers, they're humping and bumping each other's crotches and snatches.
It's fucking digusting, but I'll watch it, though, right or wrong.
I knew you would.
Oh, you like rap?
Some.
You like Jay-Z?
Of course.
You know Jay-Z?
Jigga, unh.
Hova, unh.
What, what, because he's black he knows these rappers?
I figured maybe he met him in a club.
I met LL once in a club.
See?
I told you.
Shut the fuck up, Franco.
Hey, Nino, get him in the car, huh?
What are you grabbing me for?
(SHUTTER CLICKING)
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)
Ciao.
(CHUCKLES)
Sheeee-it.
Got your ass.
SIMONA:
Please...
John Henry Armstrong... this is my father, Angelo Bonasera.
How do you do?
Mr. Bonasera, nice to meet you.
Likewise.
(IMITATING BRANDO AS CORLEONE) "When did I ever refuse an accommodation?
"All of you know me here.
"When did I ever refuse you?
"Except one time.
"And why?
"Because I believe
"this drug business is gonna destroy us
"in the years to come.
"I mean, it's not like gambling
"or liquor or even women,
"which most people want nowadays,
"and is forbidden by the pezzonovante of the Church.
"And even the police departments that've helped us in the past
"are gonna refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.
And I believed that then, and I believe that now."
(NORMAL VOICE) Then the other guy gets up.
The fat guy, Zaluchi, right, he gets up from his chair, and then he says, "I also don't believe in drugs.
"For years, I paid my people extra
"so they wouldn't do that kind of business.
"Somebody comes up to them and says,
"'I have powders.
"'If you put up 3, 4000 investment,
"we can make 50,000 distributing.'
"So they can't resist.
"I want to keep control of it as a business,
"to keep it respectable.
"I don't want it near schools.
"I don't want it sold to children.
"That's an infamia.
"In my city, we would keep the traffic
"in the dark people, the colored.
They're animals anyway, so let them lose their souls."
That's always been my favorite scene from The Godfather.
That's because it's true.
You know, Mario, he wrote a lot more.
Francis, you know, cut it out.
So is that what you believe?
What?
That we're all animals?
Hey, what I believe is inconsequential.
You know, I make my money off all kinds of different people.
Some of my customers are black people.
You have to know your customer, so you...
You do a little study.
You study us?
Hey, I'm not saying I'm...
I'm Dr. Henry Louis Gates or the other guy...
What's his name?
With the Afro?
Cornel West?
That's the guy.
But I know of a thing or two.
You know, I watch Larry King.
I got another one for you.
Go right ahead.
Why are more African-American males in jail than in college?
Why is it three out of four households... single parent, no man around?
Lack of education, environment, um, institutional racism.
Mm-hmm.
All right, I got another one for you.
Why do all these rappers think they're gangsters?
Huh?
I mean, the names they call themselves.
Uh, uh...
Gotti, Murder Inc., Death Row, C-Murder, Capone,
Scarface.
Now, they can call themselves all the Gambinos,
Genoveses, Luccheses they want, they'll never be us.
I mean, it's blood.
I agree...
They're nothing but make-believe, studio, fictionalized gangsters.
Why aspire to be us?
That's what gets me.
You think I want my nephews in this kind of business?
What with all the high-tech surveillance,
Witness Protection Program, heavy prison sentences, it's not the same, this way of life.
I'm one of the last ones.
I'm a dinosaur.
Last time I checked, your nephews love rap music.
How they were raised on Sinatra and ended up with "Snoopy Dog"
is one of life's great mysteries.
And imagine, this P. Diddy says he's the black Sinatra.
Phuh.
My ass.
Anyway, my daughter says that you signed a, uh...
A donor agreement?
So in the eyes of the law, you have no legal anything to do with my grandchildren who are on the way.
Right.
Today will be the last time you will ever see Simona.
But why did you do it?
My daughter says you have a lucrative business.
Where's your morals, your self-respect, son?
Look, I was in a tight situation.
I can understand that.
Survival makes a person do things they know in their heart is wrong.
Mr. Armstrong... it's been a pleasure talking to you, but it's time to leave.
Come on.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're safe here.
Don't worry.
It's not like in the movies.
Come on.
(CHUCKLING)
(RINGS DOORBELL)
(MUTTERS) Oh, man...
Look, it's 6 a.m., man.
Why are you still fucking with me?
Come with me.
You're wrong, spelled with a capital W.
You're a Technicolor example of all the worst stereotypes of niggras dropping babies all over the place.
Niggras like you keep holding the race back.
Oh, bullshit.
We're way past the day of one African-American representing the entire race.
I didn't say nothing about no African-American like me.
I'm talking about niggras like you.
Look, you don't know me or my situation, okay?
I know enough to make sure you spend some long time in the hoosegow.
Bet you I know that.
Come on, the Mob?
You gotta be joking, right?
You tell me, Wharton boy.
We've also got you on insider trading and fraud.
The only thing I'm guilty of is whistle blowing and that's not a crime.
Well, then, I guess you have nothing to worry about.
Yeah.
Oh, you know, by the way you're under arrest.
Shit.
Can I at least go and put on some clothes?
(CHUCKLES)
Sheeee-it.
That won't be necessary.
It's the recurring hit show The Perp Walk, guest star this week:
you.
Put your hands out.
(HANDCUFFS LOCK)
When we get outside,
I want you to show that big-ass, watermelon-eating grin that you have.
OFFICER:
Right hand.
Left hand.
Hold this.
Step to your left.
(CELL DOOR CLANGS)
ATTORNEY:
How am I gonna help you if you don't tell me everything?
I asked you from the get-go not to lie to me.
How did I lie?
I thought one thing didn't have to do with another.
That's not a lie.
You withheld information, and you thought wrong.
Okay?
Do you realize how much more difficult you have made things for yourself?
This is jail.
This is no joke.
Okay, fine.
As my attorney, tell me some shit that I can't figure out by myself.
What's the real number, Jack?
(WHISPERS) Oh, my God...
Look, I don't know.
Uh, 14, 16...
Shit.
Look, I lost count.
What were you thinking?
And don't tell me it was a case of good pussy and good money is hard to turn down.
I'm seeing your face on TV, on the front of the newspapers.
This is not the case that I agreed to take on.
I thought it didn't matter.
Everything matters in your life now, Jack.
Everything.
Do you realize how great an impact this is gonna have on how your character is viewed?
Now, I'm gonna give you some sound, legal, professional advice.
I ask that you please not speak with anyone without me.
Okay.
Good.
Now, from the beginning, and don't leave anything out.
ANNOUNCER:
Affirmative action.
Good for America?
John Henry Armstrong thinks so.
Paid for by the committee to re-elect President George Bush.
(CHILDREN CLAMORING)
Let that porch monkey Armstrong come down here and try that!
If this isn't evidence of niggras' sub-human, animalistic behavior,
I'll eat my white hood.
For Jack to give up his sperm for us women, I just think that's one of the greatest things a man can do.
(IN GERMAN) Jack Armstrong.
It's a little bit strange, this whole story.
But, if he offers and the women have enough money to do it, it's okay.
(IN SPANISH) I don't think what he's doing is right.
MAN (IN SPANISH):
Why?
Uh...
The thing about these women, these disgraced, pregnant women...
I don't think it's right.
Jack is all-man.
It's just not right.
This is Cool Cale, the original star child.
Feel me?
Now, check this out.
That cat Jack that's doing his thing, getting that 10 Gs to light them babes up,
I think he's a player.
He's sick and nasty.
The artificial way, I'm not feeling that.
There are better ways of having children other than having to sell your sperm and to buy sperm for $10,000.
You gonna feel me and know I been there.
Word up.
I'd never let him date my daughter.
Has anybody thought about those poor, poor babies?
(IN SPANISH) I want your sperm.
Because it's the only way
I'll be cured of anxiety, depression and complete panic attacks.
So, please baby, give me a night of pleasure.
I want to be with you.
I want to know why all these women want you.
I disapprove of him and pregnant lesbians because, you know, if you're not in a relationship with a woman, you know, it doesn't make no sense.
It's a simple business transaction.
Again, there might be some ethical questions.
I don't think it's unethical at all.
I wouldn't date him.
I'd fuck him, though.
WOMEN:
Jack, Jack!
He's our man!
If he can't do us, no one can!
Jack, Jack!
He's our man!
If he can't do us, no one can!
J-A-C-K!
Jack, Jack, Jack!
JUDGE:
Mr. Armstrong, you're being with charged with one count securities fraud, one wire fraud, two counts mail fraud, one count of conspiracy.
How do you plead?
I plead not guilty, Your Honor.
JUDGE:
Very well, sir.
In light of the seriousness of these charges,
I'm setting bail at $5 million.
Your Honor, bail is extremely high.
My client is not a flight risk, and he should be released on his own recognizance.
Your client is a menace to society.
Bail stands.
Margo, if you can't be on time, I'll find someone who will.
Then I suggest you start looking.
I've just resigned.
What?
I need you.
Progeia needs you.
Don't go hormonal on me, Margo.
Fuck you!
Fuck you too!
Mr. Powell.
What?
!
A Mr. Flood on line one.
I don't know any Flood.
Hold my calls.
Sir, he says he's with the SEC.
Hello.
Come here.
My God.
Baby.
Oh-ho!
Congratulations.
Stand back.
Let me see you.
How do we look?
Amazing.
How you doing?
I'm good.
MAN:
Lean not onto thine own understanding, but trust in the Lord...

Now you wanna read the Bible.
Hmph.
You have all them babies yet?

So how many is that now?
(GUARDS LAUGHING)
They treating you all right?
They're treating me fine.
Well, we're doing everything we can to get you out.
I know, Mama.
What is wrong with you?
What are you doing in here?
Look, I was in a tight situation, all right?
Well, you could have come to me.
You could have come to your father.
You could have come home like Jamal and Lucy.
First of all, I'm not choir boy Jamal, okay?
You better believe it you're not.
I would have given you the money.
All that baby mess is fucked up.
And you weren't raised like that.

FATIMA:

"I'm sure more gorgeous than when you came to visit.
"I look forward to seeing you both again soon
"and our...
Or should I say your babies.
"All this solitude gives me much time to think
"and reevaluate my life.
"I think once I'm out,
"there will be some changes made.
Love, Jack."
(HEART BEATING)
Hi.
Sit down.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
How are you?
I'm big as a house.
Does your father know you're here?
Not only does he know, he gave me his blessings.
This is from him.
What does it say?
"Mafia proverb:
"The man who does not hear and does not speak is the man who lives."

I got rejected.
What?
!
Shh.
Rejected for what?
You're the first person
I'm telling this to, all right?
(BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE)
I got rejected on three accounts.
The average for a male.
is 50 million semen per CC.
Right.
They need 100 million.
Right.
I had 10 million.
Morphology.
Shit ain't look right.
And number three is motility.
Stop smiling.
I'm not.
My ear was itching.
They weren't fast enough.
(COUGHS)
I mean, they grade sperm on a scale of zero to three...
Right.
...plus or minus, and mines was a minus one.
So I ain't had no Mark Spitz after all.
Shit is just fucked up.
Aw, come on, V.
You all right, man?
Yeah, yeah, I'm cool, man.
I mean, I'm healthy.
I can have kids.
You gonna look back on this and see it as a blessing.
Trust me.
Come on, let's go see my boy.
You think he look like me?
(LAUGHS)
Give him here.
Wait, you left.
You guys are back.
Give me a minute.
You left.
Be careful, because he's sleeping.

Hey.
This is my son.

(PEOPLE CLAMORING, GAVEL POUNDING)
MAN:
Order!
(PEOPLE CLAMORING, GAVEL POUNDING)
MAN:
Order.
Quiet!
(GAVEL BANGING)
Now...quiet!
One more sound out of here,
I'll have this chamber cleared.
Now, for the last time, Mr. Armstrong, are you gonna answer the question?
No, sir, Mr. Chairman.
I reject the question.
Well, you...
You can't reject the question.
Will you please answer the question, Mr. Armstrong.
I repeat, Mr. Chairman, I reject the question.
On what grounds do you reject the question?
On the grounds that neither you nor anyone else on this committee wants me to answer that question honestly.
No, sir, what you want is for me to sit here like some McCarthy-era puppet and give you a nice, quaint, politically-correct homage to your question of financial, moral and ethical outrage.
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I...
I am not a puppet.
CHURCH:
Mr. Armstrong, did you or did you not place a telephone call to the Ethics Commission in September of last year?
I did place a call, yes.
And was not the reason for that call, Mr. Armstrong, to deceive our financial watchdogs into thinking that unethical business practices in your company were perpetrated by another person, when they were actually perpetrated by you?
Absolutely not.
Mr. Chairman, I made that call to the Ethics Commission in earnest.
I did not make that call without careful consideration, scrutiny of the facts and tremendous angst over what the ramifications of that call might be.
Mr. Chairman, if I may be so permitted...?
Yes, yes, by all means.
The chair gratefully recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.
Thank you, Mr. Chairperson.
Now, Mr. Armstrong,
I have before me, sir, several sworn depositions from your colleagues stating that you knew well in advance that Prexelin would never gain FDA approval because, on orders from Dr. Schiller and yourself, in cahoots, key elements to the drug's effectiveness
were intentionally omitted.
Senator Sweeney,
I bitterly resent any suggestion that I had anything to do with Prexelin's failure with the Food and Drug Administration.
I worked diligently to raise capital which sole purpose was to bring to the world a cure for mankind's most deadly disease.
The great Professor Schiller wanted to extend the testing period at least a year.
Prexelin was successful on...only 75 percent of the cases tested.
He went to Powell and the board to gain approval for this delay, and they said, "No.
Full steam ahead."
They wanted to get to the finish line first, get it past the FDA and to the public.
When Professor Schiller balked, they went ahead anyway and falsified data.
Now, hold on, hold on, young man.
Now, what are you implying here?
I'm saying, Mr. Chairman, that the data is rigged.
The most recent tests are bogus.
Dr. Schiller and I believed that, with sufficient time for further testing,
Prexelin will work.
Imagine... a vaccine for the millions of people suffering with AIDS around the world, a world which, coincidentally, just so happens to include practically the entire continent of Africa.
You know, if I may, I'd like to pose a question.
When Prexelin, or any other drug, is finally approved by the FDA, will the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry raise the price so high that it's out of the reach of the vast majority of people suffering with AIDS?
50 million people will die.
MAN:
Tell the truth!
Does any one of you care?
Now, careful, Mr. Armstrong.
You just be careful, now.
You're in a very big kitchen here with a very hot fire, and I suggest that you very quickly put some truth onto the stove.
Mr. Chairman, I object to any inference that my client has been less than truthful to this body.
CHURCH:
Noted, Ms. Reid.
The record shall reflect your objection.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, let me assure you the truth is the main ingredient with which I cook, and by the time we're finished here today, we'll have a barbecue up on the Hill.
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Armstrong.
Good barbecue is hard to find.
Now, then, truthfully, please, tell us of the $350 million stock sell-off prior to the FDA's rejection of this drug.
What was your personal profit?
Zero, for the simple fact
I had no knowledge whatsoever of the purchase of the stock, let alone the sale, until the suicide of Dr. Herman Schiller.
What's Progeia's connection to the Bonasera crime family?
(WHISPERING)
Mr. Chairman, I'd like for the record to show that you referred to the Bonaseras as a crime family.
I have no knowledge of that being a fact.
CHURCH:
Fine.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
So be it.
What's your connection to the Bonasera family?
I am a friend of the family.
What kind of a friend of the family?
I'm the father to Mr. Bonasera's daughter's newborn twins.
CHURCH:
And isn't it true that you accepted large cash payments from lesbians to impregnate them?
Is this true?
Answer the question, please.
Is this true?
Yes, that is true,
Mr. Chairman.
And I'm not proud of what I did.
But that has nothing to do with why we're here.
I know that you're looking to catch a very big fish.
And here it is.
This is Dr. Herman Schiller's journal.
He told me, "Not to know is bad, not to wish to know is worse."
It's an old African proverb.
He said it as a non-sequitur right before he jumped from his 40th-floor office window.
He jumped, Mr. Chairman, because he knew the truth.
Which truth is that, Mr. Armstrong?
That we are all a bunch of hypocrites.
If that is meant as a personal affront to me,
I will have you removed right now by the federal marshal.
Fine, Mr. Chairman, have me escorted out, but we are hypocrites, all of us, because we seek to destroy the very individuals who are bound by their moral and spiritual convictions, good, regular Americans,
people like Cynthia Cooper of Worldcom,
Coleen Rowley of the FBI, and Sherron Watkins of Enron.
The whistle blowers.
And people like Frank Wills.
Frank Wills?
Who in dang tarnation is Frank Wills?
He is me, Mr. Chairman, and I am him.
Would you, uh, back that truck up again just one more time for us, please.
JACK:
For both of us, in the course of doing our job, made a decision that changed the course of our lives.
From Watergate to Contragate to Financial Gate.
What is he doing?
(MEN SPEAKING SPANISH)
MAN:
Come on, guys, let's cut out the Spanish.

Why don't you tell me what you're doing here.
We are not armed, okay?
We are citizens of the United States.
American citizens with latex gloves on.
Well, we're a little allergic to paper, so we have to wear these.
Let's talk about that down at the precinct.
JACK:
The Watergate building,
Democratic National Committee Office, the nation's capital.
2:30 a.m., June 17th, 1972.
A watchman in the night brought these criminals to justice.
James McCord, Ex-CIA.
Frank Sturgis, CIA-connected.
Eugenio R. Martinez, CIA-connected.
Virgilio R. Gonzalez, anti-Castro Cuban nationalist.
Bernard L. Baker, involved in the Bay of Pigs.
But these guys were small potatoes.
They just happened to leave a money trail all the way to the president of the United States,
Richard Milhouse Nixon.
Faced with impeachment and conviction,
Nixon chose to resign.
Frank Wills and I... are one.
(WHIMPERS)
America killed him, but you will not kill me.
I have too much to live for.
(MOANS IN PAIN)
So, Mr. Chairman, here is your, uh, barbecue.
And I hope you'll excuse me, because I'm about to be a father.
Again.
CHURCH:
Hold on.
We gotta go.
Hold on.
I'm not finished with you.
Come on.
I got you.
I got you.
CHURCH:
You are in contempt.
Marshals, take that man Into custody.
You are now in contempt, Mr. Armstrong.

Mr. John Henry Armstrong, you've been given six months for contempt of a federal hearing, but I'm gonna dismiss that charge.

Please don't put the cuffs on.
It will destroy my daughters.
Do you have children, Agent Flood?
Two boys.
Then you understand.
I'm begging you on their behalf.
Please don't do this to them.
Their friends will see this on TV.
Good.
Then they'll know you're a damn criminal.

Oh, look.
See, they're taking him away now... for a long time.

He doesn't look too happy.
He's going away.

May I talk to you for a minute, please?
Mm-hmm.
In private?
I'll leave.
No.
No.
Whatever you can say to me, you can say to Alex.
You're not making this easy.
It's never been easy for us.
I love you, baby.
No, really, I'll go.
Please, stay.
You know, it's not just me.
I have Alex and Jackie and Joe.
I understand that.
I want to be the man in your lives, and I want to be a father to my two children.
What about all the other children?
I'm not proud of what I did.
Okay?
But I'm to blame, not you, not Fatima.
Nobody but me.
I don't want to burn in hell.
The four of you are my salvation.
So please don't hate me.
I could never hate you.
Could you love me...again?
Sweetie.

I have something for you right here.
Yeah?
I'll be right back, Dad, okay?

Go to Daddy.
Come here, fat boy.
Ahhhh.
Oooh.
Hey, give me Jack.
My little shortstop and second baseman.
Come here.
Hey, boy.
(KIDS LAUGHING)
JACK:
You want to jump in the sand?
Huh?
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, boy.
Mm.
(CHUCKLES)
Ooh.

Listen, I just want to tell you I don't want to talk.
Okay, I'm fine with this.
Zack, will you wait, please?
Beat it.
Ducky!
I'd really like to try and be something.
- I didn't marry you for money.
- You married me because you were pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.
If my dad is acting all weird, he's hiding something.
- Are you having an affair?
- We're in much deeper water than that.
You think I'm cute.
When I asked you out that day for Seth, I wanted it to be me.
- You are an idiot.
- An idiot you'd go out with sometime?
It's possible.
So Alex and I kissed
And you spent the whole night on the bus stop talking to Lindsay.
- I know.
Somehowthe double date worked out.
- I'm proud of you.
So what's next for you two lovebirds?
Maybe chatting at the train station?
Whispering sweet nothings at the airport?
Ryan, I'm working off the bus stop motif, bro.
Yeah, I got it.
I don't know what's next.
I'm just going to take things slow, no pressure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What about asking her to the big dance?
Oh, no, the winter dance.
Yeah, do it, man.
I'm going to take Alex.
So take Lindsay.
We can have the double date that we were supposed to have.
Ah, it just seems a little soon.
I mean, what if she's had the weekend to think about it, and just decides we should be lab partners?
All we did was talk.
Ryan Atwood... are you scared of a girl?
No, I just...
I might like her and...
I don't know, every time there's a big party to go to...
- Something goes terribly awry?
- Yeah.
Yeah, but usually to you.
Maybe this is my year to shoulder that part.
- You're not really the fist-fighting type.
- Well, you're not really the type to be scared of a girl.
Just ask her to the dance.
It's the only way to know how she feels.
Maybe I'll just go alone.
Coop, you cannot go alone.
Why not?
It's just a school dance.
It is not just a school dance.
It is the "Sno.
C."
The one night where winter comes to Newport Beach.
And your first dance of the year as social chair.
- What happened to DJ?
- Oh, I didn't ask him.
My mom's chairing the host committee.
She'd freak.
- Your mom doesn't like him?
- She doesn't know about him.
It's not his type of thing anyway.
Hi.
Hey, guys, you still haven't bought your Sno.
C. tickets yet, so can I put you down for four?
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Ah, you should take the Mrs.
Why, Cohen, you should invite the girl from Saturday night.
Yeah...
Oh, I forgot.
She totally pulled a Houdini on your ass.
Oh, right.
You must be talking about Lindsay, not Alex, the one I... made out with.
Oh, sorry.
Alex, my mistake.
And here I'm feeling sorry for the wrong girl.
I should probably get to class.
You know, you just really should make sure she wears comfortable shoes, so she doesn't twist her ankle when she's running away.
Yeah?
L
- Like him?
Zach!
Wait.
That worked out rather nicely.
Caleb, it's me.
I still haven't heard back from you about setting up another meeting with Renee Wheelerand her attorney.
So, do me a favor and call me back, will you?
How about some eggs?
You okay?
How about an omelet?
I know I'm not supposed to ask about the case...
Honey, even if I could talk about it, I'd have nothing to tell you.
Dad's still not talking.
What could he possibly have done that he would rather go to jail than admit to?
Unless...
Life with Julie Cooper is tougher than we thought.
- What are you going to do?
- The only thing I can do.
Ask for a continuance... buy some time and... find out what he's hiding.
Hey...
how you doing?
Hey, uh, good.
I'm, I'm good.
Um...
I thought about what you said all weekend, and you were so sweet and so honest.
I'm glad, 'cause, um, there's this dance.
Actually..
I don't think so.
I mean, I would love to go out with you, but we're lab parters, and can you imagine how awkward it's gonna be if we break up?
We haven't even gone out yet.
And it's already awkward.
Let's face it, relationships almost always end badly.
And this way, we can be friends for the rest of our lives.
- So, you just want to be friends?
- I think we should be.
- Hello?
- Hey, is now a bad time?
- Well, where are you?
- I'm in the parking lot.
You think you can get away for lunch?
I really like our lunch breaks.
So what's this Sno.
C.?
It's just this dance.
We never get snow here, so we kind of have to make it ourselves.
Mm, sounds like fun.
Actually, it's very Harbor.
- You'd probably hate it.
- I guess it's a good thing that no one's asked me, then.
I would've; it's just I'm kind of running it, so I figured...
You don't want to be distracted by having to...
I don't know... finally introduce me to your friends?
I'm sorry.
But I figured I'd be so busy, I'd be a bad date.
If you...
It's cool.
I'd rather be alone with you anyway.
Well, we could go out afterward.
Or we could just stay in.
Marissa?
Oh, my God.
The yard guy?
Mom...
- What are you doing home from school?
- I'm on my lunch break.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back.
- I've got to get to work.
- No, you don't.
You're fired.
- And you, young lady, are grounded.
- Like that's going to keep me from seeing him.
Come on, DJ.
You stay away from my daughter, you hear me?
- Oh, thanks, Michelle.
- Did my dad call?
- ?
.
- Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go with the judge?
Well, not only was my motion fora continuance denied, but the trial's now been fast-tracked.
We've got less than two weeks.
I'm calling Caleb again.
- How could I have not seen this coming?
- Honey, come on, how could you have?
Your call has been forwarded to an...
I've been working with him side by side all this time.
How could I have not known that he was bribing this woman from the city council?
- If that is what he was doing.
- What did she say at her deposition?
Nothing.
Her lawyer wouldn't let her answer any of my questions.
- You can't talk to her without a lawyer.
- Well...
I could
- That would be unethical.
- Yeah, strictly speaking.
But desperate times...
I'm just saying, if I happen to run into the woman.
I don't want you getting yourself in trouble over this.
Aw, honey... it's a little late for that.
Hey, Ryan.
- You know where I can buy my Sno.
C. tickets?
- I can't say I do.
- You're not going?
- Uh, no.
- No one to go with?
- I had someone to go with.
She just didn't want to go with me.
- You going with someone?
- Definitely.
It's a given, right?
- Except, of course, for Cohen?
- I don't think he's asking Summer.
I don't think he has to.
I mean, even if he doesn't ask her, somehow, the night's going to end up about them.
Yeah, I get that.
Believe me.
But, uh, I think it's really over.
- I mean, Seth's got a new girl now.
- Really.
- So he's over Summer?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
I think so.
He wants to be.
Oh, hello, Alex.
How are we today?
Here, finally.
Can you carry these to the storeroom?
The storeroom, sure.
Maybe you'd like to show me where it is?
All right, Cohen, we need to work.
Okay, by work,you mean ( clearing throat ) make out?
No.
By work, I mean work.
All right, no romance in the workplace.
That's fine.
I can respect that.
But in that case, Harbor School's annual Sno.
C. Ball is coming up.
What do you say?
A little dancing, a little faux snow?
Obviously you got the wrong idea Saturday night, because you and me... it's not happening.
Okay.
Okay, except you did kind of kiss me.
Uh-huh.
It was fun.
It was fun?
It didn't mean anything to you?
- Dude, it was just a kiss.
- Okay, then why didn't you just shake hands?
Thanks, Homer.
See you Thursday.
Thank you.
- You just kissed the beer guy.
- So?
It is just a kiss.
Right, Mandy?
Right.
So, Saturday night was fun, but that's all.
Those sodas aren't going to carry themselves to the store room.
Do you think it's offensive to say that, like, all women are crazy?
Probably to women.
It makes no sense, man, Alex kisses me, then she turns right around and she kisses Homer.
- Who's Homer?
- The beer guy.
And he's not a looker either.
- And then after that, she turns right around and kisses Mandy.
- Mandy's a girl?
No, I couldn't even enjoy it, so consumed was I with how crazy women are.
Ugh.
Believe me, I know.
I spent all night at a bus stop talking to Lindsay, everything's great.
- Next thing I know, she dumps me before we even go out.
- Crazy
- I know.
- I know.
I'm telling you, man, women are so freaking crazy, I wouldn't be surprised if next time we see them,
Alex is dragging me to the store room and Lindsay's asking you to the dance.
I don't think so.
Which part, you and Lindsay or me and Alex getting it on?
Hey!
Hey.
How are you?
You need a hand with something?
- Sure.
- All right.
Ryan, be a gentleman.
- I've got class.
- What do you need me to grab?
- Um, in my car is a penguin.
- A penguin?
Be careful.
- Uh, don't worry, I'm fine.
- It's the penguin I'm worried about.
- He's very expensive.
- Oh, is he?
Well Ryan, please, no, don't.
- The penguin likes Marissa!
- That's not funny!
Stop.
Seriously.
It's not too late.
You can still ask him to the Sno.
C.
You have no idea how hard it is...
The boy loves to dance.
- He's going to think I'm crazy.
- He knows you're a girl.
He expects it.
I have your tickets for the dance.
And no arguements, okay?
Because it's for charity.
If I buy the thing, do I have to go?
I'm kind of dateless at the moment.
- me, too.
- What about you and DJ?
I thought you guys were...
We're hanging out, but...
It's a school dance and I think he'd feel weird about it.
- Hey, it's my school and I feel weird about it.
- Yeah, me, too, and I'm the one throwing the thing.
- I guess you can't not go, huh?
- I wish.
Both of my parents are hosting
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we go together?
As friends, of course.
But, at least that way, we wouldn't have to be alone.
- That's true.
- Great, so 7:00 is good?
Hello, Summer.
You look lovely today.
Are those Manolos?
What do you need, Cohen?
Well, I need help.
No argument here.
See, it turns out Ryan's good for some things.
Comic books, bench-pressing, engine repair, but sometimes
- A more feminine point of view is required.
- You're asking me for girl advice?
I know it's really weird, because you know, you and I are not, anymore.
The thing is, Summer, truthfully, you're the only person in my life that I...
You're right, this is really weird and bad.
I'm sorry.
- No, it's...
- It's really, it's cool.
It's okay.
I'm listening.
- Really?
- Kind of.
Okay.
All right, so you remember that girl from Saturday, right?
The one that I...
- You made out with and were rubbing my nose in it.
- So I thought, you know, she likes me, right?
- So I asked her to the dance.
- She said no.
- Right.
And then she kissed two people right in front of me.
- Damn, she's good.
At what?
Besides kissing, though.
Well, she's playing you hot and cold, and so far, Cohen, you've just been hot.
Not that kind of hot.
You need to cool down, Cohen.
You've got to go like Iceman on her ass and see how she likes it.
- Was that your first X-Men reference?
- Top Gun.
That's one of the greatest love stories of our time.
Ms. Wheeler!
Sandy Cohen.
Caleb's attorney.
- Mr. Cohen, you know I can't speak to you without my attorney present.
- With all due respect, you didn't say a word to me when
I had nothing to say.
- I'm not the one on trial here.
- Then why'd the DA indict you, too?
Ask my lawyer.
You're going to be hearing from him as well as the Bar Association.
Good-bye, Mr. Cohen.
You're hiding something, Ms. Wheeler?
We both know it.
- Look, whatever is going on between you and Caleb...
- There is nothing going on between me and Caleb.
Oh, okay, well, there was.
Wasn't there?
So you had an affair, so what?
It's over.
Why not come forward?
Why risk both of you going to jail over, over nothing?
I have to go.
I'll see you in court.
So, I've been thinking and well...
Yes.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
- You would?
- Yes.
I'm kind of going with someone else now.
- With Marissa?
- Yeah.
- God... of course.
- But only because you said...
No, no, I know.
I was right the first time.
Really, I don't...
I don't even like dances, so...
Have fun.
Hey.
I missed you at lunch.
Yeah, I was in the library.
I had to finish a history paper.
Oh, library, God, how can you work in there?
- It is, like, so quiet.
- Look, I've got world lit so I got to go.
Well, hey, um, I was thinking, maybe before the dance, we could, like, go get...
Yeah, about that.
Um, it turns out I'm not going to be able to go.
- I've got family stuff.
Sorry.
- Unless you're, like, grieving over the death of a family pet, we're going to the Sno.
C
Why don't you just ask Cohen?
I'm sure he'd love to take you.
Hey, great, you're here!
The floors need sweeping and mopping, and I know how much you love cleaning the bathrooms, so I saved them for you.
- But you can start with clearing those empties.
- Great, I'll get right on it.
Not very chatty today, are ya?
I don't know, is there something you wanted to talk about?
- No.
Not really.
- All right.
You know what?
There is something that I think we should discuss.
Here's the thing.
First of all, I love working here.
I do.
But right now, for me, with school and homework, and this dance coming up, I don't know that I have time for a job.
- You're quitting?
- Yeah.
Because I wouldn't make out with you in the storeroom?
What?
No, just, come on.
Listen, I asked you to a dance.
You said no.
I respect that, okay?
I do.
I just... for me, I have just a lot of obligations right now outside of the Bait Shop, so...
You know.
Um, this is what I owe you for the week, so...
Okay, yeah, well, you know, looks like it's... all there.
It's been really great working with you.
With you.
I mean, you've been lovely, so...
See ya.
Take care.
It is your lawyer leaving you another message Call me back, will you?
I've had a breakthrough.
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure.
Are the boys still here?
We should get some pictures before they head out to the big dance.
Come on, buddy, get off your ass.
Come to the party.
Thank you, Ryan, but I'd like to just sit here and watch my kung fu movie if you don't mind.
Well, Marissa and I are only going as friends, we can all go together.
That is how lame I've become.
I can't even be third wheel to an actual relationship.
Look at you.
Oh, you look sharp.
So you taking that girl that Seth was telling me about?
- No, it didn't really work out.
- Seth, why aren't you dressed?
- You're going to be late for the party.
- Not the Seth Cohen pity party.
Could you guys maybe take this discussion elsewhere?
Samuel Hong's about to face off with his arch nemesis.
It's kind of a big deal.
You know, I kind of feel like kicking back to the good movie
Me, too.
What are we watching?
Masters of Martial Art.
- Masters of Martial Art?
- Yes.
I hear this is wonderful.
Why is that ninja smoking a cigarette?
Honey, I don't actually think that's a ninja.
Ninjas usually wear capes, right?
Oh, so a ninja's like a super hero.
Mom, Dad, you two enjoy.
Ryan, give me five minutes.
Where you going?
Come on back!
Nice work.
Never underestimate a parent's ability to mortify his child.
So, no Sno.
C. for DJ?
With my mom and dad hosting?
He'll just pick me up after.
Then maybe Zach will show, and we can all go out.
I don't care if Zach shows.
In fact, honestly, I would rather go by myself.
Oh, really?
- You would?
- No.
Good, 'cause you're going with me and Ryan.
Great, now I'm going to be dragged along like the homely cousin from Iowa.
Well, you know, at least I won't have to deal with Cohen knowing that I'm going alone.
Oh...
God.
Hello, Summer.
Where's Zach?
So, just like old times, huh?
Seriously, man, four people and not one of us could get a real date.
I guess we're going to win the awards for biggest losers in Newport Beach.
You must win that award a lot.
I'm sorry.
Is Zach in here?
Is he hiding somewhere?
Zach?
Zachary?
At least he didn't kiss two people right in front of me.
- Who did that?
- Seth's girlfriend.
Oh!
I'm sorry, that's right.
She dumped you!
She kissed two guys right in front of you?
I think it was a guy and a girl.
- What?
!
- Thanks for that, buddy.
Wait, she kissed another girl?
You did not tell me that!
I...
A gentleman never tells when his girl kisses a girl and a guy.
It does kind of feel like old times.
Oh, my God, Coop!
Is it okay?
Okay?
It's beautiful.
I can't believe you did all this.
It reminds me of when Mr. Freeze attacked the Gotham Society Ball, which is a compliment.
Well, I'm just glad people showed up and they're actually dancing.
- Yeah, wanna...?
- Dance?
Sure.
Why not?
I'll see you later.
Don't even think about it.
- How bad do you wish DJ were here right now?
- It's okay.
Just, if it's not too weird, don't stand so far away.
It looks like we're in the fifth grade.
Jimmy, look!
She looks beautiful.
Yes, but more importantly, she's with Ryan, who right now, let's face it, looks like Prince Charming.
- So you're happy?
- Oh, so happy.
Thank you for coming.
- Dad.
Sandy didn't tell me you were coming over.
- He said he had something that could save my hide.
- Clearly, he didn't share it with you.
- No, he actually respects things like attorney-client privilege.
- Yeah, I said call me, not come over.
- I was in the neighborhood.
So, what've you got?
What is this miraculous development?
I spoke with Renee Wheeler today.
I know about the affair.
- What?
- Relax.
She didn't give you up.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because the details of my personal life have no bearing on this case.
Oh, yes they do.
The D.A. thinks you've been paying off Renee Wheeler to get building permits.
The D.A. 's an idiot.
Even if you were having an affair with this woman... 16 years is an awfully long time to be paying someone palimony.
Unless there was a child.
- That is the most preposterous...
- Was there a child?
We were together just a few months.
Renee came to me, said she was pregnant.
I set up a trust.
It was a long time ago, Sandy.
I made a mistake.
Well, when you make a mistake... you really make a mistake.
First thing Monday morning, you and Renee are going to go the judge and tell him everything.
I can't do that.
- You're both looking at jail time.
- I'm sorry, Sandy, I can't.
Hey, this is KHHS, the Harbor School Radio Station coming to you live from the Sno.
C. Winter Dance, and this is song for all you lonely hearts out there.
Fine.
But no talking.
Ryan?
- You look so handsome.
- Thanks.
I know that you and I have had our differences in the past, but now with you and Marissa are back together...
Actually, we're...
With you gone this summer, she got a little bit out of control.
But with the both of us looking out for her...
Hi, sweetie.
We were just talking about you.
Well, we don't want to keep you from your hosting duties.
- She told you you were handsome?
- Yeah.
A year ago she wanted to have me committed 'cause I was dating you.
Now, somehow, you've managed to find someone she hates even more.
I know.
Can you imagine what she would have done if I'd brought DJ?
Kind of.
Which is why I'm surprised you didn't.
You usually don't pass upa chance to ruin your mom's night.
Yeah, but why put DJ through that?
I just told him to come after.
So, it's not because you're embarrassed?
I already told you, the winter ball, it's... not his type of thing.
Did he decide that or did you?
I figure we're probably the same size.
Thanks.
You sure you're going to be okay?
Yeah.
Actually, there's something I have to do.
Can I talk yet?
I just was curious, why Zach isn't here.
Because...
he was jealous, I guess.
He was jealous?
Of what?
Of, uh, my good looks and charm?
Of my modesty?
- Of your big mouth.
He saw us talking.
- When?
In the hallway, in the lounge.
Before, during and after school.
I mean, we were just talking.
- Hey, guys.
- Zach, you came!
Yeah.
I thought you might still need a date.
- Stupid, huh?
- Zach, it's really not like that.
Yeah, it is.
I
- I get it.
You guys are just one of those couples even when you're not being a couple, you'll always be a couple.
You're Joanie and Chachie.
Luke and Leia.
Luke and Leia were brother and sister.
Yeah, well, may the force be with you.
I was just in the neighborhood.
it-it's Freud.
I have slippers with Freud on them.
They're my Freudian slippers.
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to tell you... that I should have gone to the dance with you.
I wanted... to go... with you.
- That's why you're here?
- And I was hoping we could, you know, do something, hang out.
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.
What about tomorrow night?
- Ryan, this isn't going to work.
- Why not?
- Because, you're... you're you.
- Wh-What does that mean?
I mean, you're this tough kid from Chino who lives in some rich family's pool house, with an ex-girlfriend who's maybe the most intimidatingly beautiful girl in the history of high school.
Yeah, but right now I'm here with you.
I mean, I will see you at school, in the hallway, in class and...
I'm not giving up... 'cause I like you.
Who knows why.
I think that if you got to know me, you'd like me, too.
Good night.
Hello, Renee.
- Thank you for agreeing to meet me here.
- What's this all about, Caleb?
- I understand you had a run-in with my son-in-law.
- He came to see me, but I didn't say anything.
I know and I appreciate that.
This must be tough on you.
We just have to get through the next couple of weeks.
And then what?
Then you go to jail?
- Are you really willing to do that to protect the secret?
- It's not the secret I'm trying to protect, it's my family.
- This would devastate my daughter.
- And what about mine?
Ours.
I could arrange for you both to leave the country.
Not permanently, just until this blows over.
What are you going to do?
I don't know anymore.
- Pretty quiet around here, huh?
- Yeah, all the kiddies are at their various winter dances.
Yoo-Hoo please.
One.
- You were at the Killer show here, right?
- I go to a lot of shows here, as I work here.
- No, yeah, you were here with Ryan.
- Um, yeah, at the time.
Why, you go to Harbor?
Why aren't you at the Sno.
C. Winter Wake-Off?
It's complicated.
Or not.
The girl I like is in love with another guy and probably always will be.
And right now, your girl is at the dance with the other guy?
And you're here.
Well, if she didn'tlove you before,then this display of courage and dedication should definitely do the trick.
I'm sensing a low level of sarcasm here.
What am I supposed to do?
- Be a man.
Put down your chocolate soda and fight for her.
- I'm not really much of a fighter.
I know I look big, but it's just, I have broad shoulders.
No, what I mean is that she can't fall for you if you're not there to catch her.
You're right.
At least threaten to fight for her.
And even if it turned into an actual fight, I could take Seth Cohen.
Thanks.
Did he just say Seth Cohen?
That's our gardener.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Jimmy!
- No, come on.
- Let go.
- You're coming with me.
- Jimmy, I have to...
What, embarrass Marissa?
Don't you remember when we were kids?
No one could keep us apart.
First of all, it is not the same thing.
Second of all, am I the gardener in this scenario?
I think not.
My parents threatened to cut me off if I didn't break up with you.
You never told me that.
- I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
- What did you tell them?
I told them to go to hell.
I told them I was in love with you.
I was.
Well, I was easy to love back then.
I was beautiful and much nicer.
Jules, come on, you're still beautiful.
And we both know you were never nice.
We said that we were going to stay away from each other.
Except Ryan left with the car.
Well, I have to wait for DJ and Marissa to finish making out, so...
- So it looks like we've done really well for ourselves.
- Oh, yeah, very impressive.
- Yeah, nice going.
- Right back at ya.
Zach!
Hey, man, you came back.
Listen, now...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.
- You hit him?
I know...
I don't know what happened.
I never hit anybody before.
You'd never know it.
- I'm, I'm so sorry.
- I probably deserved it.
Seth?
Alex?
Alex?
Alex.
- What are you doing here?
- I felt responsible for you.
I can take it from here.
Yeah, I, uh...
I guess you can.
- Come on, Zach.
See you guys.
- Sorry, Cohen.
Come on.
We have a first aid kit back at the club.
- The storeroom, perhaps?
- Do you want to get hit again?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Look, I'm really sorry.
It's just every time I turn around, it's you and Cohen.
I know.
I'm sorry.
But he's not my boyfriend.
He's not.
He's just...
He's Cohen.
So what am I?
Well, you were my boyfriend.
Until you decided not to take me to the dance.
So, can I ask you a question?
Will you go to the dance with me?
Hmm...
let me think about it.
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.
It's just a shame you got there when you did, 'cause I was about ready to, you know, bring the hurt.
- Really.
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- I'd like to see that.
- Yeah?
A little bit of...
a little bit of that?
Oh, no.
What are those?
These?
These are fists, okay?
Or, as I like to call them, the twin ambassadors of pain.
- Come here.
Stand up.
- You're touching the twin ambassadors.
Hold them like.
.. like this.
- Okay.
What are you doing?
- I'm teaching you to defend yourself.
- What, against who?
You?
- Quite possibly.
This is really fun, thanks.
All right, all right.
Okay.
- Defend yourself.
- I don't know how.
I'm sorry.
My eye, I think you just scratched my cornea.
- I can't see.
- No!
No way, no.
- It's blurry.
- Put your hands down.
Let me see.
It's blurry.
- What are you talking about?
It's fine.
- Then why does it hurt?
There.
Is that better?
A little.
A little bit.
Did I get you anywhere else?
You kind of nicked me right there a little bit, I think.
Yeah, I don't know.
It hurts.
Come in.
After you left, I tried to read and I do this thing where I put a red dot at the bottom of the page to see how efficiently I'm reading.
And sometimes I have to read a page two or three times, so there will be two or three red dots.
Um, well, after you left,
I made 11 red dots at the bottom of the page.
- Eleven.
- Lindsay...
I'm talking too much, as usual.
I'm sorry.
I just, I get nervous and I start talking and then... nothing can shut me up.
Except that, I guess.
I know something we can do that doesn't involve a lot of talking.
All right, throw it again.
- Throw it!
Throw it!
- Wait, wait.
- Wait, what happened to my head?
- It rolled under the truck.
- What?
- It's not good.
- So this is hanging out, huh?
- Yeah.
- Ms. Wheeler!
- Sorry to come by so late.
Who is it Sandy?
Is everything okay?
I'm Kirsten Cohen.
Renee Wheeler.
Hi.
Renee is a witness in your father's case.
Let's go out back where we can talk.
We won't be long.
I shouldn't be talking to you.
If anyone finds out...
They won't.
You have my word.
I just need to know what has Caleb told you.
I know everything.
Without any help from Caleb.
Which is why I need you.
If you were to come forward to the judge with the right documentation, the D.A. would drop the charges, case would go away.
Mom!
What are you doing here?
I'm telling you it's one of the best nights I ever had.
It was crazy.
What's up, man?
Brooke?
It's called Dare Night.
One night, two teams, multiple dares.
Each envelope contains a two-part dare.
Part one is on the front, part two is on the back.
Each dare is worth a certain number of points.
-This cell phone has picture and video.
-Sweet.
You do the dare, you send proof of it to the other team.
At midnight, time's up.
We meet back here and declare a winner.
And what do we win?
You, Mouth, win an excuse to be out until midnight.
The rest of you get a night to remember.
And you get to humiliate us.
Why would we do that?
Look, there's nothing in these envelopes that's harmful to you or anyone else.
It's all about having fun, testing your limits.
Every once in a while, you've gotta wake yourself up.
You want to do it, Nate?
AII anybody does in this town is brood and pout and get married.
I'll play.
Yeah, what the hell.
I'm up for something daring.
Who else is in?
Come on, I want to play.
I didn't get invited.
Tell you what.
You can play... if Brooke and Lucas play.
-Pick the stupid teams.
-AII right.
Boys against the girls.
You six guys against the three girls, plus me.
-I count as three, anyway.
-Yeah, three girls.
Sweet.
Teams are set.
-What's this?
-That, my friend, is your first dare.
"Return these clothes to stores in the mall."
What's so hard about that?
While wearing them.
-Hello?
-You guys ready to forfeit yet?
You talk a big game, new bootie, but we're about to light your ass up.
Game on.
-AII right.
You got your picture phone?
-Yeah.
-Beautiful.
Skills.
-I got one.
AII right, boys.
The game is to divide and conquer.
I'll catch up with you guys later.
If not, we'll meet at the cafe at midnight.
-You're really gonna do this dare?
-Yeah.
You know why?
Because he doesn't think I will.
Strong.
-Tim, you coming with me?
-I'm in it to win it.
Just say yes, Tim.
-Damn.
He is good.
-But I'm better.
-I'll catch you guys later.
-Let's do this.
Okay, I hate to break up Charlie's Angels... but you guys take this Cingular phone and do these.
-There's nothing too crazy on there.
-Why do I have to go with you?
Because this is your first dare.
Please, I could do that in my sleep.
Great.
Prove it.
A little to the left.
-Do you like the Constantines?
-Sure.
I mean, as much as anyone can like a band they've never heard of.
So, how's it going?
Is everything okay?
You've stopped in for coffee every morning this week... and I enjoy seeing you.
It's just....
I'm not sure it's appropriate.
You know, in some cultures... you can buy coffee without actually having to have sex with the cafe owner.
Those cultures aren't nearly as much fun for me, but what are you gonna do?
I have jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry.
Forget that I came by.
-Absolutely.
Won't mention it again.
-Thank you.
As long as you have dinner with me.
I'd like to return this shirt.
I happen to have the receipt.
There it is, yeah.
Can I ask you why you'd like to return it?
Wrong size.
-Can we get you another size?
-No, thanks.
I'm good.
Excuse me.
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.
Smile.
Hi.
Can we have five pickled eggs, please?
So I have an idea.
Why don't we get a picture of you eating one egg and tell them you ate five?
-Haley James-Scott.
We don't cheat.
-You did with Lucas.
Don't make me smack you!
Here.
Thank you.
-AII right.
You doing this now?
-Here we go.
Do it!
Go!
Four-and-a-half more to go.
Make that five.
Not cheating tastes good.
Get that away from me.
Are you crazy?
This is it.
Massage and spa.
What's the back say?
"Ask for the special."
It's the happy ending.
Okay.
So, all I have to do is get a table?
With no wait.
It's the hottest restaurant in town.
If you insist on wasting my time, at least come up with better dares.
-Hi.
I was wondering--
-Name?
-Brooke Davis.
-No.
You didn't even check your list.
Perhaps there's another name?
-Angelina Jolie.
-No.
-The Queen of Sheba.
-No.
-The Queen of Hearts.
-No.
-How about Queen Latifah?
-I'm afraid not.
Table for two.
Right this way, sir.
-How did you do that?
-I made a reservation for two last week.
Come on, teammate.
Can I help you?
-$41,467.
-Okay.
I know exactly what the dealer invoice on this car is.
MSRP, tax, freight.
I don't want to haggle over Scotchgarding or floor mats or anything.
Take it or leave it.
-And you're sure you want this car?
-Absolutely.
Maybe you want to test-drive it before you overpay me.
Cameras, are you seeing this?
It says we have to get a hit on the fastest pitching machine.
Man, that's all me.
Back up.
"Using your head."
Come on, man.
Get in there.
We ain't got all day.
Let's go.
So, what?
You can't get a date... you move to new towns and trick people into eating with you?
You totally exposed me.
Seriously, I'm emotionally naked.
How about you?
What's your story?
Bored and ignored.
Bored, maybe.
But you've never been ignored by a guy in your life.
I meant at home, genius.
Guys are easy.
They usually fall for me over the first pathetic little dinner.
Yeah?
What do they fall for first?
The shoplifting or the eating disorder?
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm just curious.
What's your most expensive entree?
-We have--
-Sounds great.
I'll take two.
I'm really hungry.
Nicely played.
I'll be right back.
Okay, full body treatment.
The Special.
We want the Special.
What exactly is the Special?
The Special is very nice.
-Who's first?
-Me.
-Right here.
-Okay.
I'll just peel back your sheet.
So, this is legitimate, right?
Like a massage?
Dude, shut up.
I'm concentrating.
You know what?
I really don't think I need to be here for this.
-It won't take long.
-Yeah, I'll bet.
Okay.
One Special.
Full body wax.
I'm out.
Come on, Mouth.
Toughen up, dog.
-It's gonna hurt.
-So what?
Be a warrior.
-Take one for the team, Mouth.
-But what about you guys?
-Man, I'm taking the picture.
-I'm helping him.
Damn.
Man, I missed that one.
You're gonna have to do it again.
Come on.
Back on the plate.
-I need to return some pants.
-Okay.
Do you have them?
Hello.
You shouldn't be answering my phone.
-Where the hell are you?
-I'm at the cafe.
What?
Flip the Dare Card over and read it.
You did not just leave me here.
I don't have the money to pay and I am not walking out on the check.
Why not?
I've seen you steal before.
Besides, I dare you.
Okay.
Just stay put, son.
Follow me!
Hurry up!
Excuse me, miss.
Your bill.
My car's outside.
Trust me.
Mission accomplished.
-Do you want the locker key back?
-No, thanks.
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
It's this Dare Night thing.
-I just didn't want to back down.
-Yeah.
I saw you earlier and I figured it was something like that.
I don't want you to get busted for just having a little fun.
Thank you.
-So, what's your name?
-Anna.
-I'm Lucas.
You from Tree Hill?
-Yeah.
-But we wouldn't have met.
-Why not?
I tend not to roll with guys in bras and leather pants.
You're funny.
Sorry.
Anyway, I owe you.
How about you pay me back by letting me play, too?
Okay.
So, what's next?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
-"Sell a box of cookies."
-Great.
I get my crack waxed and you get cookies.
Felix left this for you.
You know, I really don't like this Felix kid.
"Good evening, Mr. or Mrs. Tree Hill Resident.
"We're selling these delicious cookies to raise money for Lady Leprechauns...
"an organization that empowers us girls to be strong, beautiful...
"independent women of tomorrow."
Screw this Dare Night crap.
I can't believe I'm wearing a skirt.
Yeah, in public.
When we get back to the cafe, I'm gonna beat on that kid, Felix.
-I think he's kind of cool.
-You would.
I'm just saying.
One week it's Lucas, now it's Felix.
Tell me who we're hating on next week, 'cause I'm having trouble keeping up.
You wouldn't have that problem if you got a life of your own... and quit living mine.
Whatever.
Tim, I didn't mean that.
Wait up, man.
Come on.
So, where was I?
You were trying to force me to get the CD changer.
I wasn't forcing you.
It was just an option I thought you might like.
There's also the leather interior... the optional touring package... and option to pause at stop signs.
Okay, that wasn't my fault.
The thing just jumped out at me.
-The stop sign?
-It practically pounced.
Okay.
I think maybe I should drive us back.
No, I'll be fine.
I just get a little nervous.
I only have so much money and this is a big decision for me.
Besides, car salesmen are always such jerks.
Why are you smiling at me?
My brother owns the dealership.
I'm just helping out.
I'm actually a mechanic.
I like mechanics.
You are such a jerk!
Come on, it was just a dare.
You got us big points for that one.
Lock it up.
You should be locked up.
Brooke, I'm sorry.
Don't go.
It was just part of the game.
I promise.
I didn't know you'd be so upset, okay?
How about you read the next one?
"Go to the cemetery.
"And take a photo in an open grave."
That's perfect, since I plan on killing you, anyway.
-I think we get bonus points for that.
-Great.
-Yo, Fergie.
What's the next dare?
-Karaoke.
Mouth.
Okay.
I've got $3.80.
-AII right, we need $5.
-A quarter!
Okay.
Hold on a second.
-My gosh.
-Are you okay?
Let's not do....
So this is dinner?
I wanted you to have anything you want.
I'm rich.
I'm getting chili on mine.
Thank you.
So, I know that my class is obviously the highlight of your week.
But what else do you like to do?
Mostly school, and the cafe, and my son.
-You have a son?
Nice.
-Yeah.
He's got a tough mom.
I think it's so great that you went back to school in your late 20s.
Early 30s?
My God, how old are you?
old enough to have never heard of that band, the Constantines.
-But see, now you're one of the hip kids.
-Hardly.
So, I was thinking about what you said last week... about challenging yourself and moving forward.
I had a plan that I would open another business here in Tree Hill... and I discussed it with my business partner and we decided to take the plunge.
-Can I invest?
-No.
But what would you say to some ice cream?
That's fine, but I'm not really made of money, Karen.
My treat.
I love ice cream, but if you bought me ice cream... does this mean that....
There are some cultures where you can actually have ice cream....
Yeah, I get it.
-How much do I owe you for the pizza?
-Nothing.
I took a little extra from the fountain.
This is weird, isn't it?
I mean, people don't just meet and hang out like this.
Unless it's a hook up.
And it's not.
I didn't think it was.
Besides, I'm not doing that anymore.
Anymore?
Long story.
Trust me.
Do you think two people can get to know each other... without ever going into their long stories?
Sure.
But isn't who you were part of who you are?
Maybe.
But I guess I'm saying... that I don't really need to know the person that you used to be... as much as the person that you're trying to be.
Yeah.
Me, too.
-You ready for our next dare?
-Yeah.
-Do the honors.
-Thank you.
"Take a photo with a stranger in a photo booth."
Come on.
So, I have a confession to make.
The card doesn't say, "Take a photo with a stranger in a photo booth."
No?
No.
It says, "Make out with a stranger in a photo booth."
Here's the thing....
Look, it's just a dare, right?
I mean, it's no big deal.
There's a Part 2, right?
"Bonus points."
You're gonna have to get out for this one.
Enjoy.
Okay.
What's next?
You gonna tell me what it was?
Maybe.
Okay, so I'm kind of thinking... that maybe we don't really need these points so much.
-Come on.
I'll protect you.
-Yeah.
That's exactly what I'm counting on.
Or maybe you prefer Lucas?
-What did Mouth tell you?
-Nothing.
When you move around a lot, school cliques are easy to read.
Who rolls with who, that kind of thing.
You and Lucas obviously had something.
Yeah, we had something.
We had something fake and painful... that I'm not going to discuss with you and a bunch of dead people.
What about you, anyway?
I can't imagine anyone would actually date you.
The question is, why would I date them... when I could just hook up with them instead?
You know, friends with benefits.
No strings attached.
I don't think that works.
Somebody always ends up getting hurt.
Not if you're upfront about it.
Think about it.
You had sex this year, and so did I.
But I didn't end up in a cemetery talking about how painful it was.
Perfect.
This one will do.
-In you go.
-No.
You haven't done anything tonight.
Why do I have to go?
I've gotta work the camera phone.
Besides, you wouldn't be able to pull me out.
I really don't like you.
Okay.
Be careful.
Okay.
-See you later.
-Felix, don't you dare leave me here!
I'm just playing.
Hold on, let me get a picture.
We've got a report of a disturbance.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Yo, man, this dare is totally screwed up, dog.
"Borrow a wild animal from the zoo"?
Like that movie where they try to steel the cougar, but--
-But what?
-The cougar ate their ass, didn't it?
Sort of.
Mouth, I said a bird, man.
We're in the damn snake house.
Man, I'm not stealing no snake, dog.
Nothing with teeth, fangs or claws, man.
Forget it.
-I guess we could try for a fish.
-Too slimy.
Look, I got a problem with animals, okay?
I've never had a pet.
I bet you Felix knows that, too.
Man, that dude is psychotic.
-Psychic.
-Yeah, that, too.
Okay, I think they're gone.
Give me a boost.
Are you kidding?
Your shoes are muddy.
It's either you give me a boost or be buried alive, girly girl.
Fine.
Okay.
Get me out.
Stupid Dare Night!
Where did you come up with this ridiculousness, anyway?
-I mean, what is the point?
-The point is simple.
To see how far you'll go.
You face your fears.
Sometimes you do things you wanna do... because calling it a dare makes it okay for a night.
Things like what?
Like spending time with me.
So, we never really talked about the wedding.
Like, how you got there.
I told you.
I got dressed, I threw up at my parents' house... brushed, flossed, and went to the beach.
Okay, hard image to forget.
But I meant more like, I don't know, how your heart got there.
Marriage is big.
I don't know how you trust somebody for your whole life.
I can't even date somebody without an escape hatch.
I don't know if it was so much about trusting Nathan, which I do.
It was more about trusting myself.
Yeah.
My old friend, self-doubt.
I don't know.
Sometimes everything seems really simple and then--
-It's not.
-Yeah.
AII right.
So, what does this card say, again?
We're supposed to go to confessional and read what's on the card.
Except, you're not supposed to read it until we get in there.
Right.
Okay, so here's the deal:
I'm actually trying to avoid eternal damnation... so, I'm gonna pass.
AII right.
Give it.
"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
"You see, lately I've been having impure thoughts about...."
Actually, I haven't been doing very well, lately.
This is the first time I've been in a church since my mom died.
I think about her every day.
I just....
I wonder what she would say to me right now, if she could see me... and see how I've been living.
And I wonder if she knows... on most days I fall short of being the person she wanted me to be.
Or...
I wonder if she saw me do that line of coke last week.
And the thing is, I don't even know why I did it.
You know, my life is pretty good.
It is.
But I was just searching for something to make it great.
Just something to make it matter.
So, I don't know.
I guess last week when I had the chance to change that... and it was just right there in front of me...
I guess I was just scared to let that go.
But I know it was wrong.
And I want my mom to know that.
And I want her to know that I am not that person.
And I'm not going to be.
I'm sure she knows.
Tim, wait up.
Look, I said I was sorry.
I didn't mean to tear you down.
-Then why did you?
-Because I was pissed at Felix, all right?
You were defending him.
I don't like him flirting with Haley.
-It's always about Haley.
-It's not always about her.
Tim, what do you want me to say?
She's my wife now.
You know, we used to be tight.
It was always you and me.
Now you're constantly with Haley or Lucas... and there's never any time for us to hang out.
Don't you miss your Tim time?
Do I miss hanging out with you?
Yes.
Do I miss you saying things like "Tim time"?
No.
Look, Tim...
I know a lot of things have changed, but us being friends isn't one of them.
We've been boys a long time now.
I wouldn't trade that for anything.
Especially now that everything's so crazy, all right?
-Can we at least finish Dare Night?
-Yeah, absolutely.
Good.
Because this next one's great.
I'd point out the safety features, but I think the fact... that we got back in one piece speaks for itself.
Look, Jules, you picked a good car.
But the price you offered me was $1,000 too high... and I couldn't take a penny more.
Is this some new car-selling trick?
How would I know?
I'm just a mechanic.
How about if I think about it?
Was my counteroffer too low?
No, I just figure that if I wait a few days, then you'll have to call me.
You have my number.
Eternal damnation for you?
I think the jury's still out on that one.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Thanks for hanging out with me tonight, Haley.
You're a good friend.
Thanks.
This was fun.
I'm glad we did this.
I needed a night like Dare Night.
Yeah, me, too.
Steal the tiki god from the second hole, right?
Check out Part 2.
Get it?
Dude, the hole's number two.
There's something wrong with you.
You know that, right?
What?
I didn't write the dare card.
Dude, hand me the camera and get me some leaves, all right?
-Thanks for hanging out tonight.
-Thank you.
I better get going.
I've got a business class in the morning and my teacher is a tyrant.
Yeah, I've heard about that guy.
I think you're doing a great thing going after your new club.
"So loosen up your collar Run like a river
"Glow like a beacon fire"
-Constantines?
-See how cool you are?
Andy, what I said earlier...
I did misread the cafe visit, right?
Absolutely not.
I'll see you in class, Miss Roe.
So, it's almost midnight, the dares are done... we should head back.
Actually, I can't.
I need to take off.
You know, I have this weird history of meeting girls... and them disappearing at the end of the night.
-You sure you can't meet my friends?
-Not tonight.
But how about you give me your number?
-Can I have yours, too?
-Luke... it was just Dare Night, right?
No bonus points for you.
I dare you to call me.
-Okay, the guys trail by 150 points.
-Yes.
-We're here.
-What is that?
We had to capture a wild animal from the zoo.
Yeah, you might want to back up.
This thing is kind of ferocious.
Go ahead and laugh.
But you should have seen this thing before we tamed it.
I'm telling you, it was vicious.
I mean, it was snappy, and....
Oh, man.
Well, well.
With your other dares, it appears to be a tie.
No, wait, don't forget this.
Dude.
What the hell are you doing?
It says it right here on the Dare Card.
Man, that's a typo.
It's supposed to say, "Take a shot on the second hole."
Gross.
No dice.
It's still a tie.
And I just happen to have a tiebreaker.
"Kiss a teammate on the mouth."
I guess you guys win.
-Damn it.
-Convenient.
Okay.
Sorry.
Okay.
AII right.
Unless any of you guys kissed a stranger in a photo booth.
That's the only dare you didn't do.
Anybody?
Come on.
-Sorry, guys.
Guess they win.
-Yes!
You know, Skills, you could always keep him.
He could be your first pet.
Man, I'm not about to keep no creepy-looking turtle, dog.
Besides, caged up ain't living.
He need to be free.
There you go.
You realize that was a saltwater turtle, right?
-Did you have fun tonight?
-Eventually.
I missed you, though.
I guess I'll see you later then.
Tim, how about a game of NBA Live?
AII right.
You see, the Tim is in the house and you better recognize that--
Just say you're gonna beat me, Tim.
Admit it.
You had a good time tonight.
If by good time you mean wasting an entire evening of my life... that I can never get back, then sure.
I have a question for you.
You said you read people... and that's how you knew to invite all of us tonight.
So how do you read me?
I don't know about you yet.
I'm gonna have to watch you a little more.
So I guess this night makes us friends.
Right?
-Maybe.
-Friends with benefits?
I'll think about it.
How was the mall?
-You don't know?
-How would I?
Fine.
So, what did you do tonight?
Not much.
Just explored, really.
I'm trying to figure this place out.
-I think we're gonna like it here, Felix.
-Yeah.
Me, too.
Okay, good night, little sister.
How was your night?
It was good.
Yours?
It was good.
Do you have a CD by the Constantines?
Yeah.
Here we go.
-It's very hip, Mom.
-Thanks.
I thought I'd try something daring.
English
What's up man?
Brooke?
It's called 'Dare Night'.
One night, two teams, multiple dares.
Each envelope contains a two-part dare.
Part one is on the front; part two is on the back.
Each dare is worth a certain number of points.
This cell phone has picture and video.
Oh sweet!
You do the dare; you send proof of it to the other team.
At midnight, time's up.
We meet back here and declare the winner.
And what do we win?
You Mouth, win an excuse to be out till midnight.
The rest of you, get a night to remember.
And you get to humiliate us.
Why would we do that?
Look guys, there's nothing in these envelopes that's harmful to you or anyone else.
It's all about having fun, testing your limits.
Every once in a while, you gotta wake yourself up.
You wanna do it Nate?
All anybody does in this town is brood and... pout, get married.
I'll play.
Yeah, what the hell.
I'm up for something daring.
Who else is in?
Come on!
I wanna play.
I didn't get invited.
Tell you what; you can play if...
Brooke and Lucas play.
- Pick the stupid teams.
- Alright.
Boys against the girls.
You six guys against the three girls... plus me.
I count as three anyway.
Yeah, three girls!
Sweet.
Teams are set.
- What's this?
- That my friend... is your first dare.
Return these clothes to stores in the mall.
What's so hard about that?
While wearing them.
- Hello?
- You guys ready to forfeit yet?
You talk a big game little booty, but we about to light your ass; up.
Game on.
Alright.
Nate you got your picture phone?
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.
Skills.
I got one.
Alright boys, that game is to divide and conquer.
Alright, I'll catch up with you guys later.
If not, we meet at the café at midnight.
You really gonna do this dare?
Yeah.
You know why?
Coz he doesn't think I will.
Strong.
- Tim, you're coming with me.
- I'm in it to win it.
Just say yes, Tim.
- Damn, he is good.
- But I'm better.
Catch you guys later.
Let's do this.
Okay, hate to break up Charlie's Angels but... you guys take the Cingular phone and do these.
There's nothing too crazy on there.
Why do I have to go with you?
Because this is your first dare.
Please!
I could do that in my sleep.
Great!
Prove it.
A little to the left.
You like 'The Constantines'?
Sure.
I mean as much as anyone can like a band they've never heard of.
So... how's it going?
Um... is everything okay?
You've stopped in for coffee every morning this week and well I enjoy seeing you it's just, well I'm not sure it's appropriate.
Well you know, in some cultures ah, you can buy coffee without actually having to have sex with the café owner.
Um, you know, those cultures aren't nearly as much fun for me but what you gonna do?
I have...
I've jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry.
Um... forget that I came by.
- Absolutely.
Won't mention it again.
- Thank you.
As long as you have dinner with me.
I'd like to return this shirt.
Oh, I happen to have the receipt.
Here it is, yeah.
Can I ask you why you'd like to return it?
Um... wrong size?
Can't we get you another size?
No, thanks, no I'm good.
I'm good.
Oh um... excuse me?
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.
Smile!
Hi, can we have five pickled eggs please?
So I had an idea, why don't we just get a picture of you eating one egg and then tell them you ate five.
Haley James-Scott, we don't cheat.
Well you did with Lucas.
Don't make me smack you!
Here!
Thank you.
- Alright, are we doing this now?
- Here we go!
Do it, do it.
Go go go.
Four and a half more to go!
Oh, make the five.
Mmmm.
Not cheating tastes good.
Get that away from me you crazy...
Well this is it.
Massage and Spa.
What's the back say?
Ask for the special.
It's the Happy Ending.
Okay, so all I have to do is get a table?
With no waiting.
It's the hottest restaurant in town.
If you insist on wasting my time, at least come up with better dares.
- Hi, I was wondering...
- Name?
- Brooke Davis.
- No.
You didn't even check your list.
Perhaps there's another name.
- Angelina Jolie.
- No.
- The Queen of Sheeba.
- No.
- The Queen of Hearts.
- No.
- How about Queen Latifah?
- I'm afraid not.
Table for two.
Right this way sir.
How did you do that?
I made a reservation for two last week.
Come on team mate.
Can I... help you?
Forty-one thousand four hundred and sixty seven dollars.
Okay...
I know exactly what the dealer invoice on this car is.
MSRP, tax, freight.
I don't wanna haggle over scotch or... floor mats or anything.
Take it or leave it.
- And you're sure you want this car?
- Absolutely.
Hmm.
Well maybe you wanna test-drive it before you over-pay me.
Cameras, are you seeing this?
It says we have to get a hit on the fastest pitching machine.
Oh man, this all good, back up.
Using your head.
Well come on man, get in there.
We aint got all day.
Let's go.
So what, you can't get a date.
Move to new towns and trick people into eating with you?
Wow, you totally exposed me.
Seriously, I mean mostly naked here.
How bout you?
What's your story?
Bored and ignored.
Bored maybe... but you never been ignored by a guy in your life.
I meant at home, genius.
Guys are easy.
They usually fall for me over the first... pathetic...
little... dinner.
Yeah?
What do they fall for first?
The shoplifting or the eating disorder?
Excuse me!
Hi.
Just curious; what's your most expensive entrée?
Well, we have...
Sounds great.
I'll take two.
I'm really hungry.
Nicely played.
I'll be right back.
Okay!
Full body treatment.
The special.
We want the special.
What exactly is the special?
Oh the special is very nice.
- Who's first?
- Me.
Okay.
I'll just peel back your sheet.
Oh yeah!
So this is legitimate right?
This is...
like a massage?
Dude, shut up!
I am concentrating.
Yeah, you know what, I really don't think I need to be here for this.
Oh... it won't take long.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Okay, one special!
Full... body... wax!
I'm out!
Come on Mouth, toughen up dawg!
- It's gonna hurt!
- So what?
Be a warrior.
- Yeah, take one for the team Mouth.
- But what about you guys?
- Man, I'm takin the pictures.
- I'm helpin him.
Dang!
Man I missed that one.
You gonna have to do it again.
Come on, back on the plate.
Uh...
I need to return some pants.
Okay... do you have them?
Hello?
You know, you shouldn't be answering my phone.
Where the hell are you?
I'm at the café.
What?
Flip the dare card over, and read it.
You did not just leave me here!
Look, I don't have the money to pay for this and I am not walking out on the cheque!
Why not?
I've seen you steal before.
Besides, I dare ya.
Okay.
Just stay put son.
Follow me!
Hurry up!
Excuse me Miss!
Your bill!
My car's outside!
Trust me.
Ha, mission accomplished.
You want the locker key back?
No thanks!
Look, I'm sorry about all of this.
I... just... dare night thing.
Just didn't wanna back down.
Oh yeah.
I saw you earlier and I figured it was something like that.
I didn't want you to get busted for just having a little fun.
Thank you.
- So what's your name?
- Anna.
I'm Lucas.
You from Tree Hill?
Yeah, but... we... wouldn't have met.
Why not?
Oh, I tend not to roll with guys in bras and leather pants.
You're funny.
Oh sorry.
Anyway, I owe you one.
Well... how bout you pay me back by letting me play too.
Okay.
So?
What's next?
Um...
I don't know.
Lets find out.
Sell a box of cookies.
Great.
I get my crack waxed and you get... cookies.
Felix left this for you.
You know, I really don't like this Felix kid.
Good evening Mr and Mrs Tree Hill resident.
We're selling these delicious cookies to raise money for 'Lady Leprechauns'.
An organisation that empowers us girls to be strong, beautiful, independent women of tomorrow.
Screw this dare night crap!
Can't believe I'm wearing a skirt!
Yeah, in public.
When we get back to the café, I'm gonna beat on that kid.
Felix!
I think he's kinda cool.
You would.
I'm just saying.
One week it's Lucas, now it's Felix.
Just tell me who we're hatin on next week
Nate coz...
I'm kinda having trouble keeping up.
Yeah well you wouldn't have that problem if you got a life of your own and quit living mine.
Whatever!
Tim, I didn't mean that.
Wait up man.
Come on!
So, um... where was I?
You're trying to force me to get the CD changer!
I wasn't forcing you.
It's just an option I thought you might like.
There's um... also the leather interior, the... optional touring package... and option to pause at stop signs!
Okay, that wasn't my fault.
The thing just jumped out at me.
- The stop sign?
- It practically pounced!
Okay!
Um...
I think maybe I should drive us back.
No, I'll be fine.
I just get a little nervous.
I only have so much money and this is a big decision for me.
Besides, car sales men are always such jerks.
Why are you smiling at me?
My brother owns the dealership, I'm just helping out.
I'm actually a mechanic.
Oh.
I like mechanics.
Oh, you are such a jerk!
Come on, it was just a dare.
You got us big points for that one.
Lock it up!
You should be locked up!
Brooke, I'm sorry!
Don't go.
It was just part of the game.
I promise.
I didn't know you'd be so upset.
Okay?
How bout you read the next one?
Go to the cemetery.
Hm!
And take a photo in an open grave!
That's perfect.
Since I plane on killing you, anyway!
I think we get bonus points for that.
Great!
- Hey yo, Fergie, what's the next dare?
- Karaoke.
- Mouth!
- I like big butts and I can not lie,
You other brothers can't deny, When a girls walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung!
Wanna pull up front Cuz you notice that butt was stuffed
Okay, I got three dollars and... eighty cents!
Alright, we need five dollars.
Oh, a quarter!
Fellas
Fellas
Has your girlfriend got the butt?
Well shake it,
Shake it,
Shake that healthy butt Baby got back
Okay, hold on a second.
Oh, oh my gosh!
Are you okay?
It look...
Oh!
Ooh.
So ladies Ladies
If you wanna role in my Mercedes
Then turn around Stick it out
Even white boys got to shout Baby got back!
Baby got back.
So this is dinner.
I want you to have anything you want.
I'm rich you know.
Well I'm getting chilli on mine!
Thank you.
Thank you.
So...
I know that my class is obviously the highlight of your week but what else do you like to do?
Mostly school and the café and my son.
You have a son?
Nice.
Yeah.
Well he's got a tough mom.
I think it's so great that you went back to school in your late twenties you know.
Early thirties?
My god, how old are you?
Old enough to have never heard of that band, 'The Constantines'.
Ah, but you see, now you're one of the hip kids.
Hardly.
So I was thinking about what you said last week; about challenging yourself, moving forward.
Well I had a plan that I would open another business here in Tree Hill and I discussed it with my business partner and... we decided to take the plunge.
Can I invest?
No!
But what would you say to some ice-cream?
Oh it's fine but I'm not really made of money, Karen.
My treat.
Well I love ice-cream but... if you bought me ice-cream, you know, does this mean that...
You know, there are some cultures where you can actually have ice-cream-
- Yeah, I get it.
- Yeah.
How much do I owe you for the pizza?
Nothing.
I took a little extra from the fountain.
This is... weird.
Isn't it?
Oh I mean, people don't just meet and hang out like this.
Unless it's a hook-up.
- And it's not?
- I didn't think it was.
Besides, not doing that anymore.
Anymore?
Long story.
Trust me.
Do you think two people can get to know each other... without ever going into their long stories?
Sure.
But isn't who you were a part of who you are?
Maybe, but I guess I'm saying that;
I don't really need to know the person that you used to be.
As much... as the person that you're trying to be.
Yeah... me too.
- You ready for our next dare?
- Oh, yeah.
Do the honours.
Take a photo, with a stranger... in a photo booth.
Come on.
So.
I have a confession to make.
The card doesn't say take a photo with a stranger in a photo booth.
No?
No.
It says... make out with a stranger in a photo booth.
Ah, here's the thing...
Look, it's just a dare, right?
I mean... it's no big deal.
There's a part two right?
Ah; bonus points.
You're gonna have to get out for this one.
Mm, enjoy.
Okay!
What's next?
You gonna tell what it was?
Maybe!
Okay, so I'm kinda thinking that... maybe we don't really need these points so much.
- Come on!
I'll protect you.
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm counting on.
Well maybe you prefer Lucas.
What did Mouth tell you?
!
Nothing.
We move around a lot, school cliques are easy to read;
who rolls with who, that kinda thing.
You and Lucas obviously had something.
Yeah we had something.
We had something fake and painful that I'm not gonna discuss with you and a bunch of dead people.
What about you anyway?
I can't imagine anyone would actually date you.
The question is; why would I date them?
When I could just hook up with them instead.
You know, friends with benefits.
No strings attached.
I don't think that works.
Somebody always ends up getting hurt.
Not if you're upfront about it.
Think about it; you had sex this year, and so did I... but I didn't end up in a cemetery talking about how painful it was.
Oh perfect!
This one will do.
In you go.
Oh no!
You haven't done anything tonight.
Why do I have to go?
I gotta work the camera phone.
Besides, you wouldn't be able to pull me out.
I really don't like you.
Okay.
Be careful.
Okay.
See you later.
Felix, don't you dare leave me here!
I'm just playing.
Hold on.
Let me get a picture.
What're you doing!
?
Stop it!
Yo man, this dare is totally screwed up, dawg.
Borrow a wild animal for the zoo?
It's like that movie where they try to steal the cougar but...
- But what?
- Cougar ate their ass didn't it?
Sort of.
Mouth man, I said a bird man.
We in a damn snake house!
Man, I'm not stealin no snake, dawg.
Nothing with teeth, fangs or claws.
Man forget it!
I guess we could try for a fish.
Uh-uh.
Too slimy.
Look, I got a problem with animals okay?
I've never had a pet.
I bet you Felix knows that too.
I mean that dude is psychotic.
- Psychic.
- Yeah, dat too.
Okay, I think they're gone.
Gimme a boost.
Are you kidding?
Your shoes are muddy.
It's either you give me a boost or be buried alive girly girl.
Fine!
Okay.
Get me out.
Stupid dare night.
Where did you come up with this ridiculousness anyway?
I mean, what is the point!
?
The point is simple;
see how far you'll go.
You face your fears.
And sometimes you'll do things you wanna do because calling it a dare makes it okay for a night.
Things like what?
Like spending time with me.
So we never really talked about the wedding.
Like... how you got there.
I told you;
I got dressed, I... threw up at my parent's house, brushed, flossed and... went to the beach.
Okay, hard image to forget.
But, I meant more like...
I don't know; how your heart got there.
Marriage is big.
I don't know how you trust somebody for your whole life.
I can't even... date somebody with that escape hatch.
I don't know if it was so much about trusting Nathan - which I do - it was... more about trusting myself.
Yeah, my old friend; self doubt.
I dunno, sometimes everything seem... really simple
- and then...
- It's not?
Yeah.
Alright, so what does this card say again?
We're supposed to... go to the confessional and read whatever's on the card except you're not supposed to read it until we get in there.
Right, right, right.
So... okay, so here's the deal;
I'm actually trying to avoid eternal damnation... so...
I'm gonna pass.
Alright.
Give it.
Bless me father for I have sinned.
You see, lately I've been having impure thoughts about...
Um... actually, I haven't been doing very well lately.
This is... the first time I've been in a church since my mom died.
I think about her every day!
I just...
I wonder what she would say to me right now if she could see me and see how I've been living.
And I wonder if she knows and most days, I fall short of being the person that she wanted me to be.
Or...
I wonder if she saw me do that line of coke last week!
And the thing is...
I don't even know why I did it.
You know, my life is pretty good, it is.
But...
I was just searching for something to make it great.
Something to make it matter so...
I don't know, I guess last week when I had the chance to change that and it was... it was right there in front of me,
I guess I was just scared to let that go.
But I know it was wrong.
And I want my mom to know that and...
I want her to know that I am not that person.
And I'm not going to be.
I'm sure she knows.
Tim, wait up!
I said I was sorry.
I didn't mean to tear you down!
Then why did you?
Because I was pissed at Felix alright?
And you were defending him.
- I just don't like him flirting with Haley.
- It's always about Haley.
No it's not always about her.
Tim, what do you want me to say?
She's my wife now.
You know, we used to be tight!
It was always you and me.
Now you're constantly with Haley or Lucas, and there's never any time for us to hang out.
Don't you miss your 'Tim Time'?
Do I miss hanging out with you?
Yes.
Do I miss you saying things like 'Tim Time'?
No.
Look, Tim, I know a lot of things have changed but us being friends isn't one of them.
We've been boys a long time now.
I wouldn't trade that for anything.
Especially now that everything's so crazy.
Alright?
- Can we at least finish 'Dare Night'?
- Yeah absolutely.
Good.
Coz this next one's great.
Well I'd, uh, point out the safety features but I think that fact that... you know, we got back in one piece speaks for itself.
Look Jules; you picked a good car.
But... the price you offered me was a grand too high and I couldn't take a penny more.
- Is this some new car selling trick?
- How would I know?
I'm just a mechanic.
How bout if I think about it?
Was my counter offer too low?
No, I just figured that if I wait a few days, then you'll have to call me.
You have my number.
Eternal damnation for you?
I think jury's still out on that one.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for hanging out with me tonight Haley.
You're a good friend.
Thanks.
This was fun.
I'm glad we did this.
I needed a night like 'Dare Night'.
Yeah, me too.
Steal the Tiki God from the second hole right?
Here, check out part two.
Get it?
Dude, the hole's number two!
There is something wrong with you.
You know that right?
What?
I didn't write the dare card.
Dude, hand me the camera and give me some leaves alright?
Thanks for hanging out tonight.
Well thank you.
Well...
I better get going.
I've got a business class in the morning and my teacher is a tyrant.
Yeah, I heard about that guy.
Karen,
I think you're doing a great thing; going after you new club.
It's a 'Loosen up your collar', 'Run like a river', 'Glow like a beacon fire'.
- Constantines?
- Oh, see how cool you are?
Um Andy, what I said earlier...
I did misread the café visit, right?
Absolutely not.
I'll see you in class, Miss Roe.
So, it's almost midnight.
The dares are done, we should head back.
Actually, I can't.
I need to take off.
You know, I had this... weird history of meeting girls and them... disappearing at the end of the night.
You sure you can't meet my friends?
Not tonight.
But how about... you give me your number?
Can I have yours too?
Luke, it was just 'Dare Night', right?
No bonus points for you.
Anna?
I dare you to call me.
The guys trail by a hundred and fifty points.
Yes!
We're here.
What is that?
We had to capture a wild animal from the zoo.
Yeah, you might wanna back up.
This thing is kinda ferocious.
Go ahead and laugh, but you shoulda seen this thing before we tamed it.
I'm telling you, it was vicious.
I mean it was snapping and...
Oh man!
Well, well.
With your other dares, it appears to be a tie.
Oh no, no.
Wait, don't forget this.
Dude!
What the hell are you doing?
!
It says it right here on the dare card.
Man, that's a typo.
It's supposed to say take a shot on the second hole.
Tim!
Gross!
No dice.
It's still a tie and I just happen to have a tie breaker.
Kiss a team mate on the mouth.
Well I guess you guys win.
Damn it!
Convenient!
Okay.
Sorry!
Okay!
Alright.
Unless any of you guys... kissed a stranger in a photo booth... that's the only dare you didn't do.
Anybody?
Sorry guys.
Guess they win.
You know Skills, you could always keep him.
He could be your first pet.
Man, I'm not bout to keep some creepy looking turtle, dawg.
Besides, caged up aint living.
He need to be free.
There you go.
You realise that was a saltwater turtle, right?
- Hey, did you have fun tonight?
- Eventually, missed you though.
I guess I'll see you later then.
Tim.
How about a game of NBA Live?
Alright.
You see, the 'Tim' is on the house and you better recognise...
Just say you're gonna beat me, Tim.
Admit it; you had a good time tonight.
By a good time, you mean wasting an entire evening of my life that I can never get back?
Then sure.
I have a question for you.
You said you read people and that's how you knew to invite all of us tonight.
So how'd you read me?
I don't know about you yet.
Gonna have to watch you a little more.
So I guess this night makes us friends!
Right?
Maybe.
Friends with benefits?
I'll think about it.
How was the mall?
You don't know?
How would I?
Fine.
So, what'd you do tonight?
Not much.
Just explored really.
Trying to figure this place out.
I think we're gonna like it here, Felix.
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.
Goodnight, little sister.
Hey.
How was your night?
Was good!
Yours?
It was good.
Hey, do you have a CD by The Constantines?
Yeah.
Uhh...
Here we go.
It's very hip, mom.
Thanks.
I thought I'd try something daring.
Synchro :
Amariss
Listen, I just want to tell you I don't want to talk.
Okay, I'm fine with this.
Zack, will you wait, please?
Beat it.
Ducky!
I'd really like to try and be something.
- I didn't marry you for money.
- You married me because you were pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.
If my dad is acting all weird, he's hiding something.
- Are you having an affair?
- We're in much deeper water than that.
You think I'm cute.
When I asked you out that day for Seth, I wanted it to be me.
- You are an idiot.
- An idiot you'd go out with sometime?
It's possible.
So Alex and I kissed
And you spent the whole night on the bus stop talking to Lindsay.
- I know.
Somehowthe double date worked out.
- I'm proud of you.
So what's next for you two lovebirds?
Maybe chatting at the train station?
Whispering sweet nothings at the airport?
Ryan, I'm working off the bus stop motif, bro.
Yeah, I got it.
I don't know what's next.
I'm just going to take things slow, no pressure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What about asking her to the big dance?
Oh, no, the winter dance.
Yeah, do it, man.
I'm going to take Alex.
So take Lindsay.
We can have the double date that we were supposed to have.
Ah, it just seems a little soon.
I mean, what if she's had the weekend to think about it, and just decides we should be lab partners?
All we did was talk.
Ryan Atwood... are you scared of a girl?
No, I just...
I might like her and...
I don't know, every time there's a big party to go to...
- Something goes terribly awry?
- Yeah.
Yeah, but usually to you.
Maybe this is my year to shoulder that part.
- You're not really the fist-fighting type.
- Well, you're not really the type to be scared of a girl.
Just ask her to the dance.
It's the only way to know how she feels.
Maybe I'll just go alone.
Coop, you cannot go alone.
Why not?
It's just a school dance.
It is not just a school dance.
It is the "Sno.
C."
The one night where winter comes to Newport Beach.
And your first dance of the year as social chair.
- What happened to DJ?
- Oh, I didn't ask him.
My mom's chairing the host committee.
She'd freak.
- Your mom doesn't like him?
- She doesn't know about him.
It's not his type of thing anyway.
Hi.
Hey, guys, you still haven't bought your Sno.
C. tickets yet, so can I put you down for four?
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Ah, you should take the Mrs.
Why, Cohen, you should invite the girl from Saturday night.
Yeah...
Oh, I forgot.
She totally pulled a Houdini on your ass.
Oh, right.
You must be talking about Lindsay, not Alex, the one I... made out with.
Oh, sorry.
Alex, my mistake.
And here I'm feeling sorry for the wrong girl.
I should probably get to class.
You know, you just really should make sure she wears comfortable shoes, so she doesn't twist her ankle when she's running away.
Yeah?
L
- Like him?
Zach!
Wait.
That worked out rather nicely.
Caleb, it's me.
I still haven't heard back from you about setting up another meeting with Renee Wheelerand her attorney.
So, do me a favor and call me back, will you?
How about some eggs?
You okay?
How about an omelet?
I know I'm not supposed to ask about the case...
Honey, even if I could talk about it, I'd have nothing to tell you.
Dad's still not talking.
What could he possibly have done that he would rather go to jail than admit to?
Unless...
Life with Julie Cooper is tougher than we thought.
- What are you going to do?
- The only thing I can do.
Ask for a continuance... buy some time and... find out what he's hiding.
Hey...
how you doing?
Hey, uh, good.
I'm, I'm good.
Um...
I thought about what you said all weekend, and you were so sweet and so honest.
I'm glad, 'cause, um, there's this dance.
Actually..
I don't think so.
I mean, I would love to go out with you, but we're lab parters, and can you imagine how awkward it's gonna be if we break up?
We haven't even gone out yet.
And it's already awkward.
Let's face it, relationships almost always end badly.
And this way, we can be friends for the rest of our lives.
- So, you just want to be friends?
- I think we should be.
- Hello?
- Hey, is now a bad time?
- Well, where are you?
- I'm in the parking lot.
You think you can get away for lunch?
I really like our lunch breaks.
So what's this Sno.
C.?
It's just this dance.
We never get snow here, so we kind of have to make it ourselves.
Mm, sounds like fun.
Actually, it's very Harbor.
- You'd probably hate it.
- I guess it's a good thing that no one's asked me, then.
I would've; it's just I'm kind of running it, so I figured...
You don't want to be distracted by having to...
I don't know... finally introduce me to your friends?
I'm sorry.
But I figured I'd be so busy, I'd be a bad date.
If you...
It's cool.
I'd rather be alone with you anyway.
Well, we could go out afterward.
Or we could just stay in.
Marissa?
Oh, my God.
The yard guy?
Mom...
- What are you doing home from school?
- I'm on my lunch break.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back.
- I've got to get to work.
- No, you don't.
You're fired.
- And you, young lady, are grounded.
- Like that's going to keep me from seeing him.
Come on, DJ.
You stay away from my daughter, you hear me?
- Oh, thanks, Michelle.
- Did my dad call?
- ?
.
- Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go with the judge?
Well, not only was my motion fora continuance denied, but the trial's now been fast-tracked.
We've got less than two weeks.
I'm calling Caleb again.
- How could I have not seen this coming?
- Honey, come on, how could you have?
Your call has been forwarded to an...
I've been working with him side by side all this time.
How could I have not known that he was bribing this woman from the city council?
- If that is what he was doing.
- What did she say at her deposition?
Nothing.
Her lawyer wouldn't let her answer any of my questions.
- You can't talk to her without a lawyer.
- Well...
I could
- That would be unethical.
- Yeah, strictly speaking.
But desperate times...
I'm just saying, if I happen to run into the woman.
I don't want you getting yourself in trouble over this.
Aw, honey... it's a little late for that.
Hey, Ryan.
- You know where I can buy my Sno.
C. tickets?
- I can't say I do.
- You're not going?
- Uh, no.
- No one to go with?
- I had someone to go with.
She just didn't want to go with me.
- You going with someone?
- Definitely.
It's a given, right?
- Except, of course, for Cohen?
- I don't think he's asking Summer.
I don't think he has to.
I mean, even if he doesn't ask her, somehow, the night's going to end up about them.
Yeah, I get that.
Believe me.
But, uh, I think it's really over.
- I mean, Seth's got a new girl now.
- Really.
- So he's over Summer?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
I think so.
He wants to be.
Oh, hello, Alex.
How are we today?
Here, finally.
Can you carry these to the storeroom?
The storeroom, sure.
Maybe you'd like to show me where it is?
All right, Cohen, we need to work.
Okay, by work,you mean ( clearing throat ) make out?
No.
By work, I mean work.
All right, no romance in the workplace.
That's fine.
I can respect that.
But in that case, Harbor School's annual Sno.
C. Ball is coming up.
What do you say?
A little dancing, a little faux snow?
Obviously you got the wrong idea Saturday night, because you and me... it's not happening.
Okay.
Okay, except you did kind of kiss me.
Uh-huh.
It was fun.
It was fun?
It didn't mean anything to you?
- Dude, it was just a kiss.
- Okay, then why didn't you just shake hands?
Thanks, Homer.
See you Thursday.
Thank you.
- You just kissed the beer guy.
- So?
It is just a kiss.
Right, Mandy?
Right.
So, Saturday night was fun, but that's all.
Those sodas aren't going to carry themselves to the store room.
Do you think it's offensive to say that, like, all women are crazy?
Probably to women.
It makes no sense, man, Alex kisses me, then she turns right around and she kisses Homer.
- Who's Homer?
- The beer guy.
And he's not a looker either.
- And then after that, she turns right around and kisses Mandy.
- Mandy's a girl?
No, I couldn't even enjoy it, so consumed was I with how crazy women are.
Ugh.
Believe me, I know.
I spent all night at a bus stop talking to Lindsay, everything's great.
- Next thing I know, she dumps me before we even go out.
- Crazy
- I know.
- I know.
I'm telling you, man, women are so freaking crazy, I wouldn't be surprised if next time we see them,
Alex is dragging me to the store room and Lindsay's asking you to the dance.
I don't think so.
Which part, you and Lindsay or me and Alex getting it on?
Hey!
Hey.
How are you?
You need a hand with something?
- Sure.
- All right.
Ryan, be a gentleman.
- I've got class.
- What do you need me to grab?
- Um, in my car is a penguin.
- A penguin?
Be careful.
- Uh, don't worry, I'm fine.
- It's the penguin I'm worried about.
- He's very expensive.
- Oh, is he?
Well Ryan, please, no, don't.
- The penguin likes Marissa!
- That's not funny!
Stop.
Seriously.
It's not too late.
You can still ask him to the Sno.
C.
You have no idea how hard it is...
The boy loves to dance.
- He's going to think I'm crazy.
- He knows you're a girl.
He expects it.
I have your tickets for the dance.
And no arguements, okay?
Because it's for charity.
If I buy the thing, do I have to go?
I'm kind of dateless at the moment.
- me, too.
- What about you and DJ?
I thought you guys were...
We're hanging out, but...
It's a school dance and I think he'd feel weird about it.
- Hey, it's my school and I feel weird about it.
- Yeah, me, too, and I'm the one throwing the thing.
- I guess you can't not go, huh?
- I wish.
Both of my parents are hosting
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we go together?
As friends, of course.
But, at least that way, we wouldn't have to be alone.
- That's true.
- Great, so 7:00 is good?
Hello, Summer.
You look lovely today.
Are those Manolos?
What do you need, Cohen?
Well, I need help.
No argument here.
See, it turns out Ryan's good for some things.
Comic books, bench-pressing, engine repair, but sometimes
- A more feminine point of view is required.
- You're asking me for girl advice?
I know it's really weird, because you know, you and I are not, anymore.
The thing is, Summer, truthfully, you're the only person in my life that I...
You're right, this is really weird and bad.
I'm sorry.
- No, it's...
- It's really, it's cool.
It's okay.
I'm listening.
- Really?
- Kind of.
Okay.
All right, so you remember that girl from Saturday, right?
The one that I...
- You made out with and were rubbing my nose in it.
- So I thought, you know, she likes me, right?
- So I asked her to the dance.
- She said no.
- Right.
And then she kissed two people right in front of me.
- Damn, she's good.
At what?
Besides kissing, though.
Well, she's playing you hot and cold, and so far, Cohen, you've just been hot.
Not that kind of hot.
You need to cool down, Cohen.
You've got to go like Iceman on her ass and see how she likes it.
- Was that your first X-Men reference?
- Top Gun.
That's one of the greatest love stories of our time.
Ms. Wheeler!
Sandy Cohen.
Caleb's attorney.
- Mr. Cohen, you know I can't speak to you without my attorney present.
- With all due respect, you didn't say a word to me when
I had nothing to say.
- I'm not the one on trial here.
- Then why'd the DA indict you, too?
Ask my lawyer.
You're going to be hearing from him as well as the Bar Association.
Good-bye, Mr. Cohen.
You're hiding something, Ms. Wheeler?
We both know it.
- Look, whatever is going on between you and Caleb...
- There is nothing going on between me and Caleb.
Oh, okay, well, there was.
Wasn't there?
So you had an affair, so what?
It's over.
Why not come forward?
Why risk both of you going to jail over, over nothing?
I have to go.
I'll see you in court.
So, I've been thinking and well...
Yes.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
- You would?
- Yes.
I'm kind of going with someone else now.
- With Marissa?
- Yeah.
- God... of course.
- But only because you said...
No, no, I know.
I was right the first time.
Really, I don't...
I don't even like dances, so...
Have fun.
Hey.
I missed you at lunch.
Yeah, I was in the library.
I had to finish a history paper.
Oh, library, God, how can you work in there?
- It is, like, so quiet.
- Look, I've got world lit so I got to go.
Well, hey, um, I was thinking, maybe before the dance, we could, like, go get...
Yeah, about that.
Um, it turns out I'm not going to be able to go.
- I've got family stuff.
Sorry.
- Unless you're, like, grieving over the death of a family pet, we're going to the Sno.
C
Why don't you just ask Cohen?
I'm sure he'd love to take you.
Hey, great, you're here!
The floors need sweeping and mopping, and I know how much you love cleaning the bathrooms, so I saved them for you.
- But you can start with clearing those empties.
- Great, I'll get right on it.
Not very chatty today, are ya?
I don't know, is there something you wanted to talk about?
- No.
Not really.
- All right.
You know what?
There is something that I think we should discuss.
Here's the thing.
First of all, I love working here.
I do.
But right now, for me, with school and homework, and this dance coming up, I don't know that I have time for a job.
- You're quitting?
- Yeah.
Because I wouldn't make out with you in the storeroom?
What?
No, just, come on.
Listen, I asked you to a dance.
You said no.
I respect that, okay?
I do.
I just... for me, I have just a lot of obligations right now outside of the Bait Shop, so...
You know.
Um, this is what I owe you for the week, so...
Okay, yeah, well, you know, looks like it's... all there.
It's been really great working with you.
With you.
I mean, you've been lovely, so...
See ya.
Take care.
It is your lawyer leaving you another message Call me back, will you?
I've had a breakthrough.
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure.
Are the boys still here?
We should get some pictures before they head out to the big dance.
Come on, buddy, get off your ass.
Come to the party.
Thank you, Ryan, but I'd like to just sit here and watch my kung fu movie if you don't mind.
Well, Marissa and I are only going as friends, we can all go together.
That is how lame I've become.
I can't even be third wheel to an actual relationship.
Look at you.
Oh, you look sharp.
So you taking that girl that Seth was telling me about?
- No, it didn't really work out.
- Seth, why aren't you dressed?
- You're going to be late for the party.
- Not the Seth Cohen pity party.
Could you guys maybe take this discussion elsewhere?
Samuel Hong's about to face off with his arch nemesis.
It's kind of a big deal.
You know, I kind of feel like kicking back to the good movie
Me, too.
What are we watching?
Masters of Martial Art.
- Masters of Martial Art?
- Yes.
I hear this is wonderful.
Why is that ninja smoking a cigarette?
Honey, I don't actually think that's a ninja.
Ninjas usually wear capes, right?
Oh, so a ninja's like a super hero.
Mom, Dad, you two enjoy.
Ryan, give me five minutes.
Where you going?
Come on back!
Nice work.
Never underestimate a parent's ability to mortify his child.
So, no Sno.
C. for DJ?
With my mom and dad hosting?
He'll just pick me up after.
Then maybe Zach will show, and we can all go out.
I don't care if Zach shows.
In fact, honestly, I would rather go by myself.
Oh, really?
- You would?
- No.
Good, 'cause you're going with me and Ryan.
Great, now I'm going to be dragged along like the homely cousin from Iowa.
Well, you know, at least I won't have to deal with Cohen knowing that I'm going alone.
Oh...
God.
Hello, Summer.
Where's Zach?
So, just like old times, huh?
Seriously, man, four people and not one of us could get a real date.
I guess we're going to win the awards for biggest losers in Newport Beach.
You must win that award a lot.
I'm sorry.
Is Zach in here?
Is he hiding somewhere?
Zach?
Zachary?
At least he didn't kiss two people right in front of me.
- Who did that?
- Seth's girlfriend.
Oh!
I'm sorry, that's right.
She dumped you!
She kissed two guys right in front of you?
I think it was a guy and a girl.
- What?
!
- Thanks for that, buddy.
Wait, she kissed another girl?
You did not tell me that!
I...
A gentleman never tells when his girl kisses a girl and a guy.
It does kind of feel like old times.
Oh, my God, Coop!
Is it okay?
Okay?
It's beautiful.
I can't believe you did all this.
It reminds me of when Mr. Freeze attacked the Gotham Society Ball, which is a compliment.
Well, I'm just glad people showed up and they're actually dancing.
- Yeah, wanna...?
- Dance?
Sure.
Why not?
I'll see you later.
Don't even think about it.
- How bad do you wish DJ were here right now?
- It's okay.
Just, if it's not too weird, don't stand so far away.
It looks like we're in the fifth grade.
Jimmy, look!
She looks beautiful.
Yes, but more importantly, she's with Ryan, who right now, let's face it, looks like Prince Charming.
- So you're happy?
- Oh, so happy.
Thank you for coming.
- Dad.
Sandy didn't tell me you were coming over.
- He said he had something that could save my hide.
- Clearly, he didn't share it with you.
- No, he actually respects things like attorney-client privilege.
- Yeah, I said call me, not come over.
- I was in the neighborhood.
So, what've you got?
What is this miraculous development?
I spoke with Renee Wheeler today.
I know about the affair.
- What?
- Relax.
She didn't give you up.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because the details of my personal life have no bearing on this case.
Oh, yes they do.
The D.A. thinks you've been paying off Renee Wheeler to get building permits.
The D.A. 's an idiot.
Even if you were having an affair with this woman... 16 years is an awfully long time to be paying someone palimony.
Unless there was a child.
- That is the most preposterous...
- Was there a child?
We were together just a few months.
Renee came to me, said she was pregnant.
I set up a trust.
It was a long time ago, Sandy.
I made a mistake.
Well, when you make a mistake... you really make a mistake.
First thing Monday morning, you and Renee are going to go the judge and tell him everything.
I can't do that.
- You're both looking at jail time.
- I'm sorry, Sandy, I can't.
Hey, this is KHHS, the Harbor School Radio Station coming to you live from the Sno.
C. Winter Dance, and this is song for all you lonely hearts out there.
Fine.
But no talking.
Ryan?
- You look so handsome.
- Thanks.
I know that you and I have had our differences in the past, but now with you and Marissa are back together...
Actually, we're...
With you gone this summer, she got a little bit out of control.
But with the both of us looking out for her...
Hi, sweetie.
We were just talking about you.
Well, we don't want to keep you from your hosting duties.
- She told you you were handsome?
- Yeah.
A year ago she wanted to have me committed 'cause I was dating you.
Now, somehow, you've managed to find someone she hates even more.
I know.
Can you imagine what she would have done if I'd brought DJ?
Kind of.
Which is why I'm surprised you didn't.
You usually don't pass upa chance to ruin your mom's night.
Yeah, but why put DJ through that?
I just told him to come after.
So, it's not because you're embarrassed?
I already told you, the winter ball, it's... not his type of thing.
Did he decide that or did you?
I figure we're probably the same size.
Thanks.
You sure you're going to be okay?
Yeah.
Actually, there's something I have to do.
Can I talk yet?
I just was curious, why Zach isn't here.
Because...
he was jealous, I guess.
He was jealous?
Of what?
Of, uh, my good looks and charm?
Of my modesty?
- Of your big mouth.
He saw us talking.
- When?
In the hallway, in the lounge.
Before, during and after school.
I mean, we were just talking.
- Hey, guys.
- Zach, you came!
Yeah.
I thought you might still need a date.
- Stupid, huh?
- Zach, it's really not like that.
Yeah, it is.
I
- I get it.
You guys are just one of those couples even when you're not being a couple, you'll always be a couple.
You're Joanie and Chachie.
Luke and Leia.
Luke and Leia were brother and sister.
Yeah, well, may the force be with you.
I was just in the neighborhood.
it-it's Freud.
I have slippers with Freud on them.
They're my Freudian slippers.
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to tell you... that I should have gone to the dance with you.
I wanted... to go... with you.
- That's why you're here?
- And I was hoping we could, you know, do something, hang out.
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.
What about tomorrow night?
- Ryan, this isn't going to work.
- Why not?
- Because, you're... you're you.
- Wh-What does that mean?
I mean, you're this tough kid from Chino who lives in some rich family's pool house, with an ex-girlfriend who's maybe the most intimidatingly beautiful girl in the history of high school.
Yeah, but right now I'm here with you.
I mean, I will see you at school, in the hallway, in class and...
I'm not giving up... 'cause I like you.
Who knows why.
I think that if you got to know me, you'd like me, too.
Good night.
Hello, Renee.
- Thank you for agreeing to meet me here.
- What's this all about, Caleb?
- I understand you had a run-in with my son-in-law.
- He came to see me, but I didn't say anything.
I know and I appreciate that.
This must be tough on you.
We just have to get through the next couple of weeks.
And then what?
Then you go to jail?
- Are you really willing to do that to protect the secret?
- It's not the secret I'm trying to protect, it's my family.
- This would devastate my daughter.
- And what about mine?
Ours.
I could arrange for you both to leave the country.
Not permanently, just until this blows over.
What are you going to do?
I don't know anymore.
- Pretty quiet around here, huh?
- Yeah, all the kiddies are at their various winter dances.
Yoo-Hoo please.
One.
- You were at the Killer show here, right?
- I go to a lot of shows here, as I work here.
- No, yeah, you were here with Ryan.
- Um, yeah, at the time.
Why, you go to Harbor?
Why aren't you at the Sno.
C. Winter Wake-Off?
It's complicated.
Or not.
The girl I like is in love with another guy and probably always will be.
And right now, your girl is at the dance with the other guy?
And you're here.
Well, if she didn'tlove you before,then this display of courage and dedication should definitely do the trick.
I'm sensing a low level of sarcasm here.
What am I supposed to do?
- Be a man.
Put down your chocolate soda and fight for her.
- I'm not really much of a fighter.
I know I look big, but it's just, I have broad shoulders.
No, what I mean is that she can't fall for you if you're not there to catch her.
You're right.
At least threaten to fight for her.
And even if it turned into an actual fight, I could take Seth Cohen.
Thanks.
Did he just say Seth Cohen?
That's our gardener.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Jimmy!
- No, come on.
- Let go.
- You're coming with me.
- Jimmy, I have to...
What, embarrass Marissa?
Don't you remember when we were kids?
No one could keep us apart.
First of all, it is not the same thing.
Second of all, am I the gardener in this scenario?
I think not.
My parents threatened to cut me off if I didn't break up with you.
You never told me that.
- I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
- What did you tell them?
I told them to go to hell.
I told them I was in love with you.
I was.
Well, I was easy to love back then.
I was beautiful and much nicer.
Jules, come on, you're still beautiful.
And we both know you were never nice.
We said that we were going to stay away from each other.
Except Ryan left with the car.
Well, I have to wait for DJ and Marissa to finish making out, so...
- So it looks like we've done really well for ourselves.
- Oh, yeah, very impressive.
- Yeah, nice going.
- Right back at ya.
Zach!
Hey, man, you came back.
Listen, now...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.
- You hit him?
I know...
I don't know what happened.
I never hit anybody before.
You'd never know it.
- I'm, I'm so sorry.
- I probably deserved it.
Seth?
Alex?
Alex?
Alex.
- What are you doing here?
- I felt responsible for you.
I can take it from here.
Yeah, I, uh...
I guess you can.
- Come on, Zach.
See you guys.
- Sorry, Cohen.
Come on.
We have a first aid kit back at the club.
- The storeroom, perhaps?
- Do you want to get hit again?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Look, I'm really sorry.
It's just every time I turn around, it's you and Cohen.
I know.
I'm sorry.
But he's not my boyfriend.
He's not.
He's just...
He's Cohen.
So what am I?
Well, you were my boyfriend.
Until you decided not to take me to the dance.
So, can I ask you a question?
Will you go to the dance with me?
Hmm...
let me think about it.
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.
It's just a shame you got there when you did, 'cause I was about ready to, you know, bring the hurt.
- Really.
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- I'd like to see that.
- Yeah?
A little bit of...
a little bit of that?
Oh, no.
What are those?
These?
These are fists, okay?
Or, as I like to call them, the twin ambassadors of pain.
- Come here.
Stand up.
- You're touching the twin ambassadors.
Hold them like.
.. like this.
- Okay.
What are you doing?
- I'm teaching you to defend yourself.
- What, against who?
You?
- Quite possibly.
This is really fun, thanks.
All right, all right.
Okay.
- Defend yourself.
- I don't know how.
I'm sorry.
My eye, I think you just scratched my cornea.
- I can't see.
- No!
No way, no.
- It's blurry.
- Put your hands down.
Let me see.
It's blurry.
- What are you talking about?
It's fine.
- Then why does it hurt?
There.
Is that better?
A little.
A little bit.
Did I get you anywhere else?
You kind of nicked me right there a little bit, I think.
Yeah, I don't know.
It hurts.
Come in.
After you left, I tried to read and I do this thing where I put a red dot at the bottom of the page to see how efficiently I'm reading.
And sometimes I have to read a page two or three times, so there will be two or three red dots.
Um, well, after you left,
I made 11 red dots at the bottom of the page.
- Eleven.
- Lindsay...
I'm talking too much, as usual.
I'm sorry.
I just, I get nervous and I start talking and then... nothing can shut me up.
Except that, I guess.
I know something we can do that doesn't involve a lot of talking.
All right, throw it again.
- Throw it!
Throw it!
- Wait, wait.
- Wait, what happened to my head?
- It rolled under the truck.
- What?
- It's not good.
- So this is hanging out, huh?
- Yeah.
- Ms. Wheeler!
- Sorry to come by so late.
Who is it Sandy?
Is everything okay?
I'm Kirsten Cohen.
Renee Wheeler.
Hi.
Renee is a witness in your father's case.
Let's go out back where we can talk.
We won't be long.
I shouldn't be talking to you.
If anyone finds out...
They won't.
You have my word.
I just need to know what has Caleb told you.
I know everything.
Without any help from Caleb.
Which is why I need you.
If you were to come forward to the judge with the right documentation, the D.A. would drop the charges, case would go away.
Mom!
What are you doing here?
When Jushin fell, I understood the brutality of evil men's unimaginable guile.
My king died, my companions died and I lost my language.
It was then that I thought...
To take on evildoers,
I'd have to be cunning enough to outwit even those bastards.
Otherwise, I couldn't serve as an Amen-Osa.
Is...
Is that...
A Medallion of the Three Horses!
An Amen-Osa stands before you!
Shin Angyo Onshi
Long, long ago there was in the east a land called Jushin, and in that land were clandestine agents called the Amen Osa.
Amen Osa were special officials who helped the common people, traveling the provinces in secrecy as the king's special emissaries and denouncing misgovernment.
One could say that in that world, they were both individual policemen and an army.
In later days, the world became chaotic and Jushin fell, but still a single Amen Osa roamed that turbulent world.
Damn am I thirsty...
Hey...
Hey, mister!
Water...
There's no need to be in such a hurry!
I'm back among the living!
Trying to make it across this desert without even a camel...
That's way too reckless.
There are the Sarinja here too.
Sarinja?
Man-eating devils of the desert.
They're horrible creatures.
I'm Munsu.
I'm indebted to you, partner.
My name is Monlyon.
I'm a Sonbi.
A Sonbi?
You're studying to become an official or something?
Huh?
What's the story with that bird?
This little guy is a type of desert bat.
After I dressed a wound for it, it went and became attached to me.
I was formerly a veterinarian.
A veterinarian?
A doctor taking the civil-service exam...
You gonna become an influential man in your old age or something?
I'm on the way back home after finishing the test.
But...
I failed the test, and what's more, it's the third time.
And I felt confident this time too...
What official position were you aiming for?
Amen-Osa.
An Amen-Osa while you're still so young?
Sounds to me like you've got some special circumstance going on.
Yes.
The fact is, in my homeland, there's a person who's dear to me.
Her name is Chun-Hyang.
She's a very gentle person.
But the newly-arrived lord stole her away from me.
So you intend to become an Amen-Osa and punish him, and take the girl back?
That's a pretty personal reason.
You're wrong!
That lout is...
Certainly, the kind of guy who'd steal another man's woman probably can't govern fairly or anything.
You're wrong!
That lout is...
Certainly, the kind of guy who'd steal another man's woman probably can't govern fairly or anything.
But after you've punished that guy, then what'll you do?
You know an Amen-Osa isn't allowed to have a family, right?
Can you cast the girl aside and live a wanderer's life, not knowing when it might end?
As for me, I can only think of your three years as a wasted effort.
An Amen-Osa isn't a magic lamp, you know.
Your path is something you've got to carve out for yourself.
You don't know anything about it!
Who are you to talk?
Have you ever watched your own parents die right before your eyes?
Can I just let it go, knowing the pain of having a lover I cared about more than anyone stolen from me?
A man who earns his money easily can easily become poor.
You're not even willing to make the effort.
This is an Amen-Osa's badge, a Horse Medallion?
Now that Jushin has fallen, it's a useless antique.
It's payment for the water.
Take it.
Sorry, but could you give that back after all?
If it's gone, I miss it.
I'm going to try making a little more effort.
Oh?
Did you think of some better approach?
For starters, I'm going to learn the martial arts.
And then, I'll take back my love through my own strength...
Hey!
Are you okay?
What on earth...
Hobgoblins...
This is bad.
The Phantom Soldiers won't be of any use against these.
Damn!
Better be prepared to die!
I've got explosives here!
All right, listen up!
I'm gonna hand over this guy's body to you!
In return, pretend you never saw me!
You're man-eaters, right?
This young meat will be delicious.
Of course, you'd probably love to be able to taste both, but you'll only get stomach trouble out of eating me!
On top of that, I'm confident I can take out half of you bastards!
Well, what'll it be?
If my explosives go up, you'll get nothing for lunch today!
You're a persistent one.
I'm sure I told you an Amen-Osa isn't a magic lamp.
Well, there's nothing wrong with an accident from time to time.
That guy's girlfriend..."Chun-Hyang," did he say?
Now that was funny!
Won't you put more spirit into it?
You guys lodged complaints about my rule.
Ordinarily, I'd put you to death immediately along with your families, but, merciful me, if you defeat that giant, I'll let you off scot-free.
Great, great!
Lord Byon, are you satisfied now?
Yes, I'm satisfied!
You did a great job!
I did it!
I got him!
I did it with my own hands!
Well done!
I did it with my own hands!
You promised, Byon!
Release us!
Kill those fellows and put their entire families out into the desert.
They'll be perfect fodder for the Sarinja, I'd say.
Just when I thought he was a man I could use...
That was a waste of time.
Are there really so few men of strength in this world?
If things have come to this...
Lord Byon...
What's the matter?
It's about the condition of Lady Chun-Hyang, in the catacombs.
She bit her tongue in an attempt at suicide.
We dressed the wound, and we have put a gag in her mouth just in case.
Truly, every time I see you, you're beautiful.
You weren't satisfied with writhing around and giving yourself bruises, so this time you've bitten your tongue.
Chun-Hyang...
I'm shocked.
Trying to throw away your life even though your "husband" may return.
You must be patient and wait until Monlyon comes back as an Amen-Osa.
Right?
Oh, wait, now that I think of it, Jushin fell, didn't it?
In this day and age, there's no use for an Amen-Osa.
Did you bite your tongue knowing that?
That's understandable.
Now that the one and only path to saving you has been closed off, there's no way Monlyon will return.
Right about now, he's forgotten all about you and is having a good time with some little kitten somewhere.
How about it?
Won't you become mine starting now?
Forget about a guy like that and start a new life with me.
I can make the likes of you my own any time, by force.
Isn't it about time you accepted this gentle lord, who is waiting for you without causing you a single scratch?
You only need to nod your head, when you do...
The hardship will end, and happiness will begin.
I see!
If you're going to take that sort of attitude,
I'll treat you in a way appropriate to it as well.
Call the hypnotist!
Immediately!
How long is this stuff going to continue?
Ever since that Byon came, life has just gotten more terrible.
I hear an Amen-Osa showed up in the north.
They say the corrupt lord there was sent a talisman with "An" written on it, and when he saw it he started to tremble.
And I hear that after that the Amen-Osa showed up with hundreds of soldiers, and before you knew it, he got rid of that lord and his whole faction.
If only he would show up here for us too.
Even though I try to tell myself there are no more Amen-Osa or anything, recently, I can't sleep soundly.
Is it unease about assassins at hearing another lord has fallen?
After all, the more excellent the lord, the more likely he'll be targeted by assassins.
My apologies, My Lord.
Ta...
Take this creature to the dungeons!
Forgive me, please!
Do you mean to talk back to me?
No!
I had no such intention!
Very well, out of consideration for your courage...
I had intended to imprison you in the dungeon for ten years, but now I order you imprisoned for a hundred!
Lord Byon!
Please!
Forgive me, please, Lord Byon!
Forgive me, please!
Aide!
Yes, My Lord.
You still haven't you found any skilled mercenaries to protect me?
As to that, I am searching far and wide, but we simply haven't...
Are there so few men of strength in the world?
What is it?
Lord Byon, it seems an applicant to serve as a mercenary has turned up.
What's more, I'm told this man says he will face a hundred foes alone and exterminate them all.
Oooh!
Now I'm looking forward to that!
If so, we'll have to test just how tough a guy he is.
It's a press gang!
Seize every young man you find!
Yes, sir!
Chun-Hyang...
Chun-Hyang!
Awaken, Chun-Hyang!
The time has come at last.
Chun-Hyang...
You can really win against a hundred men, huh?
What kind of joke is this?
They're nothing but townsmen.
I'm granting you a little handicap, because with my hard-to-recruit soldiers, it would be a waste.
Give them all you've got!
If you can exterminate them all, I'll grant you the very finest treatment!
This is foolish.
I said I was going to exterminate your entire army.
What?
!
I've become an Amen-Osa and returned.
Mon...
Monlyon!
It's really Monlyon, isn't it?
!
Monlyon's come back!
You passed the test to be an Amen-Osa?
The Amen-Osa we've heard rumors about is you?
This means we're saved!
Clear out, you fools.
Do you think I came for your sake?
Fools?
You were trembling at the thought of facing me, a single man, even though you've got weapons.
You can all get killed by this lord for all I care.
Miracles don't happen for those who do nothing but appeal for salvation.
Hey!
Monlyon!
What did you come back to do?
There's no way a guy like you could become an Amen-Osa!
Even on the outside chance you were able to, now that Jushin has fallen, it means nothing!
If you grovel with your head on the ground and apologize here and now,
I'll grant you your life.
If you don't, all that awaits you is the same fate as your parents.
What'll it be?
These days you have nothing but bad dreams, don't you?
Because a guy who said he'd bring you to justice and left this land just might be plotting something, huh?
You, who treated him horribly...
The fear in your heart won't subside.
That's why you're trying to hire mercenaries.
But there's no need for worry.
The fool who believes in miracles is no longer among the living.
Wh...
Who are you?
Wh...
What are you doing?
Ki...
Kill this guy!
Yes, sir!
Listen well, all of you!
Everything that's about to happen is an accident.
After this, don't you dare go hoping this sort of thing will ever happen again!
An Amen-Osa stands before you!
There are things that don't go away even when a country falls to ruin:
Disgusting men like you working your foul deeds, and the Phantom Soldiers who bring justice to those villains!
Th...
That's the Ghostly Legion of Jushin!
Cut every last one down and leave them where they lie!
He's an Amen-Osa!
An Amen-Osa came for us!
Rise up, you cowards!
You still don't understand what I meant by an "accident"?
I already told you...
There are no miracles for those who only appeal for help!
You cowards who are just standing in fear and can't do anything, clear your asses out of here!
If you don't, I'll do away with you too!
Lord Byon, the preparations are complete.
Chun-Hyang, my most beloved one!
That woman is...
Chun-Hyang?
Chun-Hyang, listen carefully!
Kill every one of those things!
Where did she learn to handle a sword that way?
Now the tide has turned!
Chun-Hyang is a born fighter!
It took me half a year to capture her!
That bastard Monlyon!
What's delicate about this woman?
!
If I don't kill her, she'll kill me!
Great, great!
Chun-Hyang has become mine, and if she kills the Amen-Osa, there will be nothing I fear anymore!
What are you all up to?
Damn!
She's amazing, this woman.
This fight will be decided all in one instant.
What the...
Is this a hair band?
Wow, where did you get it?
Thanks, Chun-Hyang.
What do you think?
Does it suit me?
I intend to become an Amen-Osa.
Do you know Amen-Osa can't have families?
But don't worry.
Bodyguards called "Sando" accompany the Amen-Osa.
Become my Sando for me.
Let's travel together and help impoverished people, the two of us.
I feel so bashful somehow.
It's just like I'm proposing.
How about it, Chun-Hyang?
You'll give me your okay?
Great!
Thank you!
It's Byon's head!
We killed him with our own hands!
So they weren't just ordinary fools.
"A N"
He was a good man though I was only with him a short time.
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.
When we were attacked, it was all I could do to keep myself alive.
Just an excuse, isn't it?
Jushin fell because people believed too much in everything that was visible right before their eyes.
Use that sword for what is just, without being deceived by frauds, Chun-Hyang.
Sando...
My name is Sando.
I'll give my protection to you.
Impressive, aren't they?
I've got the new models too, that haven't hit the market in the western country.
They certainly are impressive.
They make my guns look like toys.
This is really something.
Where did you get your hands on this many weapons?
With Jushin collapsing and all, trade regulations have vanished.
If you can just gather the cash, the guys in the western lands will arrange any kind of weapons for you.
Oh, you've got a good eye.
It's the type you rig up to your arm.
You want to try putting it on?
Oh-ho, this thing is good.
It is, ain't it?
It costs a lot, but it's a fine item.
Right, I'll take it.
To show my gratitude, I'll show you something remarkable.
Huh?
Something remarkable?
Shut your eyes for a second.
Stay right there and don't move.
An Amen-Osa stands before you.
Beat this scum half to death and sink the weapons in the sea.
Of all the...
Unbelievable, even the fisherman in such a remote place would dirty their hands with smuggling.
My, my, my, somebody's seen what they're not supposed to.
Have you got some business with me?
Are you an Amen-Osa?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm an Amen-Osa.
Help me, please.
My island is in terrible...
What's it to me?
I don't know what the situation is, but I'm not interested.
An Amen-Osa isn't a champion of justice at your convenience.
Don't you do anything uncalled for.
I've got a real odd sense of curiosity too.
Listening to a request from a kid who's calling for help even though he's got no memory...
I'm sorry.
Sando!
From now on, follow every order I give without fail.
Don't hesitate, get confused or waver.
I mean at every instance.
Understood?
Sando, you stay hidden.
This is a pleasure.
Thank you so much for coming.
This is a grand welcome.
That's because not many people call upon this island, except for trade.
Though for these few years, we've had a hard time with pirates ravaging this vicinity.
What do you think you're doing?
Though for these few years, we've had a hard time with pirates ravaging this vicinity.
What do you think you're doing?
It's for Jyun's own good.
Jyun ought to realize that too.
Stop it.
Master!
This can't be helped, can it?
You're still under treatment.
This is bad.
Your mind's balance is disrupted again.
Now, just relax.
Gently, now.
Gently.
I'd like you to tell me what the situation is.
I'm the castellan of this island, Fuan-bo.
I'm Munsu.
I'm a traveling veterinarian.
This guy is a desert bat.
Jyun's family was killed some days ago, when this island was raided by pirates.
Pirates?
Regrettably, he lost his emotional balance, and is making trouble for others by doing this sort of thing time and again.
How do you do.
My name is Yuite.
I am the castle physician on this island.
Jyun's memory is temporarily disturbed from the shock of his family being killed.
He will improve soon, if he rests his body and calms his mind for the whole day today.
I'm sorry that's all it was after you came all the way out here.
You must be tired from your long journey.
Please take your ease on this island for a few days.
If you're offering, maybe I'll take you up on it.
It's gotten dangerous around here too.
Originally, it was a peaceful island with mild weather too, but these days, thanks to the pirates, the situation has become so bad we can't even feel secure sleeping at night.
Come and get some!
Wow!
At any rate, there is only one doctor on this island, Master Yuite, so a guest of your kind is most welcome.
That said, I'm only a veterinarian...
This will be your room.
You'll excuse me.
Hey!
Come faster!
Wait up!
Hurry, hurry!
Big brother...
Maybe I'll walk a little.
It's really quiet at night.
Is it all right for you to be out walking around already?
Come on, let's go.
Jyun!
Did you forget all about me?
What's the story with that guy Yuite?
I'm Jyun's older sister; my name is Yo.
Jyun's in bad physical health, so he's under treatment.
Master Yuite is a physician whom the islanders call a miracle man.
A miracle man?
He came to this island a few years ago, and saved a lot of people's lives.
Master Yuite's needle can even bring people who have died back to life.
That's why I'm assisting at his place and learning from him too.
I'm going to become a brilliant doctor like him too!
There's no such thing as a miracle in this world.
When you write the word "miracle," you spell it 'f-r-a-u-d."
It's too quiet.
Are these...
I've never seen them this big before.
So, it was this after all.
That is the medicinal herb called "mandarake."
It's a peculiar herb which screams out like a vengeful spirit when it's pulled out from the soil.
It's said that, in some cases, if an ordinary person picks it, he'll die.
Apparently, you're a miracle man, huh?
It seems the people of the island are saying so, but I'm only doing what's proper as a physician.
You don't look like him.
Oh, among my old acquaintances, there was a guy who had the same sort of powers as you, you see.
This island is a little odd.
I probably wouldn't have come here if I hadn't met Jyun, but the kid's gone and forgotten me.
That is a regrettable thing, isn't it?
What's the story with you?
You're not just some doctor, are you?
And what of you?
Are you really a veterinarian?
Come to think of it, Jyun was holding this stuff.
I don't need it anymore.
It took some searching to find you.
What do you want, showing up all of a sudden?
Jyun, do you want to see the truth about the miracles?
Jyun, why did you escape the island?
Think back!
Isn't it that you became aware of something before you left?
The truth about this island?
Kindly get out of here!
I'll call somebody!
You became aware of it, didn't you?
Of the truth about the so-called "miracles" a certain man performs on this island?
Go home!
GO HOME!
Think hard about this.
If you want me to, I'll show you the truth about this island.
I'm positive I told you before, don't do anything uncalled for!
There...
Take it and go!
You've got some mistaken idea.
I'm not your dead boyfriend!
I have no intention of inheriting his hopes!
My idea of a Sando is an absolute servant, not some kind of guard!
Just obeying my orders is enough.
If you can't do that, you're a disgrace!
Get out of my sight.
Don't concern yourself with me anymore.
I'm sorry.
I won't get in your way anymore.
Please, let me accompany you.
Master Yuite's needle can even bring people who have died back to life.
The wind has begun to blow.
Jyun, where are you going?
That was an unpleasant dream.
I have come on an errand from the Lord Castellan.
His Lordship asks if you might like to dine with him.
Gotcha.
Sorry, but wait out there a bit and let me get ready.
Master Munsu, please don't hesitate to eat all you like.
Thank you.
This island prides itself on the sea's rich abundance.
It certainly does look good.
Boy, this island does have a vitality to it, doesn't it?
Even the way the island sustains us is thanks to Master Yuite.
Oh?
Have you found this land to your liking?
Yes, however...
However?
There was something I noticed.
I don't see any animals, no dogs, no cats, on this island.
Th...
That's...
It's because some time ago, an epidemic struck.
Oh?
An epidemic?
I pushed my abilities as a physician to their limits, but my hands were full with saving the people, and I regrettably had to neglect the animals.
The devoted manner in which Master Yuite worked at that time was staggering.
I merely did as much as was proper for a physician.
So that's the explanation, is it?
Incidentally, do you know of this story?
There was an island to the west on which a plant called mandarake, which has hallucinogenic effects, grew in profusion.
That island was frequently attacked by pirates whose target was the mandarake.
But a time came when an epidemic struck, and islanders and pirates alike all dropped dead like flies.
It's an incident that happened some years ago though.
Wait!
Somebody stop him!
Master Munsu!
I remembered!
Jyun, what are you doing?
I'm here because I remembered!
Jyun, stop this, won't you?
I'm here because I remembered!
Jyun, stop this, won't you?
Listen to me!
That man's true form is a devil with black wings!
Jyun, you've had some sort of bad dream.
You...
How long do you intend to keep up this kind of farce?
It's about time to drop the curtain on it!
Right on time, as always, Mari.
Sorry, but go see what's happening for me, Mari.
Jyun...
If you want to know the truth, come with me.
Hold on to this.
A time will come when you'll need it.
What's wrong?
You don't have that kind of courage?
I'll...
I'll go.
I want to know the truth!
You're ready enough.
You watch to be sure this forest is burned to the ground.
Whatever may happen to me later, don't you leave this spot.
I'm counting on you.
Hey, Jyun!
Something seems to be burning.
What happened?
Did you die too?
Oh yes, can't say how many times I was saved by Master Yuite.
What have you done?
!
Stop!
Stop it!
I didn't ask you to do anything like this!
If you're going to get in my way, I'll shoot you too.
Jyun!
What's happening here?
Yo, run away!
Jyun!
Don't shoot my sister!
Step aside, Jyun!
If you shoot my sister, I'll take no mercy on you!
Right, then let's do this.
I won't shoot her.
Instead, you shoot her with your gun.
Then you'll understand the real guise of the truth about this island.
I know you were feeling it too.
That's why you asked for my help, right?
If you don't want to, then shoot me.
If you'll be satisfied with that, that will do too.
If I die here, it's probably because I was wrong.
Jyun, what are you doing?
!
Hurry up and shoot that murderer!
If you really want to see the truth, awaken to the truth yourself!
Yo!
This is a needle dipped in mandarake.
It gives human beings eternal rest.
It also shows human beings whatever they wish to see.
I'm sorry, sister.
But Yo, you're already dead.
What...
What in the world was I wishing for?
This is the truth about this island.
He deluded the souls of the islanders who died in the epidemic into believing they'd returned to life.
He was working his fraud even on people's souls.
He bound the dead to this world, just to call it a miracle for his own personal satisfaction.
It wasn't for my own sake.
It was salvation.
With my powers, I wanted to save those who had fallen into despair.
Why, Jyun?
After I saved this island for you just as you desired, now, of all times, will you spurn me?
No!
It's not about that!
The truth...
It's not so very important.
Such things didn't matter, so long as your pain alone was eased.
After you came to the island, it was as happy as being in Heaven, with every wish fulfilled.
But somehow...
I always had doubts.
Why?
If that's the case, I'll show you the reality that you now wish for!
Spirits of the dead!
Go to Jyun!
Taste the agony of reality!
Miracles can't exist!
I knew that, but I...
Jyun!
If you had only believed, this would have been a paradise.
But you betrayed me!
Now receive your just rewards for it!
Don't make me laugh.
I don't know who you are, and I couldn't care less what Jyun means to you, but there's no way this island, a perversion of the laws of nature, can be a paradise!
An Amen-Osa stands before you!
Send these spirits, who have strayed from their destination, and linger in this world, to Hades.
Don't lay a hand on that one though.
I'll take care of him!
It's you, is it?
Are you planning to roast yourself all alone in a place like this?
My warning that you should get out of here at once went to waste, huh?
I'm going to start with you.
I'll settle with that man later, slowly.
Draw!
What's wrong?
Are you a puppet?
Can't you do anything without that man's orders?
If not, then I'll make the first move!
Shall we continue now where we left off last night?
Salvation, you say?
Don't make me laugh.
You have no right at all to make sport with dead human beings' souls.
You fraudulent bastard.
You've got just a little more than human powers, so you think you've become a god or something?
What do you know of me?
I couldn't care less about the likes of you!
If I give you a shot with this mandarake needle, you can live forever in the world of miracles that you deny.
Who are you trying to kid?
You think I'd take a shot of that?
That's why I'm going to give you a shot.
I wonder if it won't be a more fatal wound than poison to you?
The only weapon I have is this.
With just this one piece, I'll show you my miracle.
Why do you fight so desperately for that man's sake?
Interesting!
What's the matter?
Come down here!
Damn you!
Don't play around with me!
It seems I was underestimating you.
Let's bring this to an end.
You even said it yourself, right?
That I have power superior to humans.
So why do you meddle with me nonetheless?
Lt...
It's...
There's no way you, an ordinary human being, can defeat me.
What's your reason for taking things so far?
It's because even I've got a chance at winning.
It's unfortunate.
If I could die from something like that, my pain would be eased too.
Sando...
You're counting on me, right?
I can't just watch you die.
Still trying to do something?
What can you do?
You're unarmed.
Well how about this?
I'll be damned, still had one.
I know I told you that you can't kill me with that sort of thing.
I wonder about that.
If you haven't got a body, there's nowhere to go back to, is there?
Give it up and die.
You played around with souls too much, so the one who will be receiving his just rewards is you.
Here at the end, I want to know the name of the acquaintance you said I reminded you of.
Ajite.
My purpose in being alive is to find and kill him, you see.
I'd like to have met him once.
Don't cry.
I'm sure they'll go where they were meant to go, to the place they were meant to go a long time ago.
That's the way of nature.
They're probably all grateful to you.
This is the end.
I feel it.
You were aware of it, were you?
No, I didn't know.
But when Master Yuite died, I sensed it.
Why would I alone survive if it was an epidemic?
Why just me alone?
That's when I realized that I died too, along with everyone on the island.
That's all right, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Human beings are such weak creatures, you know.
It's natural that we hope for miracles.
But it's because we are human that we can dispel the lies too.
Even when you died, you didn't lose your humanity.
So, Jyun, what is it that human beings need?
I wonder if what human beings need is the confidence to stare straight into this blue sky.
Don't you think so?
I'm sorry.
I didn't obey your orders.
Since the fall of this nation, Jushin, the truth has gotten harder to see.
Certainly, you may be powerful.
But there'll be times when, confronted with cunning miscreants who have pushed aside the good men, you'll end up powerless.
If you act on your own in that kind of situation and you die on me too, even a guy like me is going to have trouble sleeping at night.
Hey, you!
You're going to cry again?
!
Don't worry.
I haven't forgotten about you.
So long, Jyun.
Previously on Two and a Half Men.
That is a very sexy woman.
- So whose car is it?
- Psychiatrist.
Let's get out of here, Charlie.
You are not just going to leave me here, are you?
Here we are.
Chez Charlie.
- She's taking her clothes off.
- Is this a great country or what?
You guys are so cute.
Right back at you.
Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.
Hey, Charlie, you're a really cool guy.
But I'm not going to have sex with you.
Ever?
Deep tissue massage, pancakes.
If you had a TV on your forehead and could breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.
You just assume that if we are both interested in the same woman
- you would come out on top?
- Of course I would.
What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard I'll be an only child.
- Are you sure?
- It's settled.
You are staying with us.
Of course, we still don't know a damn thing about her.
I'm Joanie.
Hi.
We are going to go to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.
It's a wonderful place where those awful people will never find us.
So, Frankie, why didn't you tell us you had a daughter?
Okay, guys, here's the deal.
I didn't want you to know.
Okay.
I feel better.
I'm sorry, it's a long story.
We got time.
I'm not doing anything.
Alan, you doing anything?
No, I'm free.
I was staying with my grandma and grandpa, who are really rich, and they don't want my mom to have me, so they said she's crazy.
That wasn't so long.
- Can we please talk about this later?
- Okay.
What shall we talk about?
Are you guys gay?
Isn't she something?
Okay, here we are.
This is it, right?
One kid, no pets?
As far as I know.
- Can I go look at the ocean?
- Sure, just stay on the deck.
Okay, who has the first question?
- Alan.
- Thank you.
- What the hell is going on?
- Good one.
Here it is.
I married a really rich guy, and his parents always hated me.
I don't know.
Maybe it was because when we met, he was on the road to becoming a U.S. Congressman and I was just, you know, on the road.
Joanie, get off the railing.
Anyway, they were not happy when we got married, and they were even less happy when we used part of his trust fund to finance my recording career.
- You're a singer?
- Well, as it turns out, no.
But...
Then two years ago, Brad died.
And ever since, his parents have been trying to take Joanie away from me.
- So, the psychiatrist...
- Court ordered.
They're suing me for custody, saying I'm an unfit parent.
- Unfit, how?
- You know...
I'm not a lawyer, but taking a baseball bat to the shrink's Beamer might not have helped your case.
Yeah, they'll probably spin that one in their favor.
But I was screwed anyway because they were paying him to make me look bad.
- That's horrible.
- So what are your plans now?
I don't know.
I didn't think past just getting her out of there.
You don't have to know.
You can stay here for a while and figure it out.
Right?
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.
That'd be great.
I'll go tell Joanie.
Terrific.
We're happy to have you.
Okay, we've got to get her out of here.
- Charlie, she needs us.
- She doesn't need us.
She needs a lawyer and probably a new shrink.
Well, then we'll get her those.
At this point, I think I'd like to stop using the word "we. "
You're going to bail on her?
Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get her in bed.
That's because two days ago, she was just a crazy stranger.
If I remember correctly, you couldn't wait to get rid of her.
Yes, because she was a crazy stranger.
Now I've gotten to know her and I want her to stay.
All right, Alan, but I'm warning you.
This girl's got a lot of baggage.
I don't know if you have enough sky cabs to get her to the curb.
What?
So, Joanie, what grade are you in?
- Second.
- Really?
- I have a little boy who's in fourth.
- So?
I don't know.
I thought it'd be germane to the conversation.
Wow.
Doesn't matter how old they are, you still strike out.
You know, Joanie, you are just as pretty as your mom.
So?
I bow to the master.
Hold on, let me finish.
All right, I'm going to say this one more time real slow so there's no confusion.
You can take your damn money and stick it up your "white bread, country club,
"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.
Hi.
- Really?
I'm garbage.
- Is Alan here?
Really?
Is that right?
Well, I got news for you, lady.
The term is white trash.
- Do you know her?
- Nope, that's a new one.
- Hi, Dad.
- Jake, Judith.
What are you doing here?
Alan, I told you yesterday I was going to visit my parents.
Dad's having another colonoscopy.
If I'm not there, I'll have to watch the video.
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry.
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.
Yeah.
I just met your brother's latest stuff.
- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What?
Is it yours?
No, but it's not his, either.
- But it could be.
- Says who?
Says your ex-wife.
Okay, I really don't need to hear this.
Jake, honey, have a good time.
Charlie, behave yourself.
What about me?
I am completely capable of having my own stuff.
- Hi, I'm Joanie.
- Hey.
I'm going to go play in my room.
- Can I come with you?
- Whatever.
If he can just keep that attitude for another 30 years, he's gold.
I'm not afraid of your lawyers or your shrinks.
Fine, bring them on, because you know what?
We're going to run away and hide.
Now they're really unhappy with me.
- Is there anything we can do?
- Thanks, you've already done so much.
- I just hate to put you out like this.
- It is not a problem.
We have plenty of space.
You and Joanie can stay in my room and I'll bunk with Charlie.
You'll bunk with Charlie?
- Hold on there, Pecos Bill.
- No, it'll be fun.
It'll be like when we were kids.
Okay.
But just remember, this time Mom won't be around to hear you scream.
Why are those people here?
They're going through a tough time, and we're helping them out.
That girl is really annoying.
- I think maybe she has a crush on you.
- Yeah, that's what's annoying.
- You don't really like girls yet?
- No, I like girls.
Just not into eight-year-olds.
Is Joanie okay?
Yeah.
She fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.
- It was a long day for her.
- Yeah.
The good news is I think my in-laws are going to back off.
The bad news is that wasn't my shrink's car.
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.
But at least you made this one for the right reason.
You love your daughter.
I just wish I knew where to go from here.
Because I know I seem like I've got it all together,
- but this is a little...
- Scary?
Yeah.
I understand.
When my marriage ended, I was terrified.
It's the unknown.
- Yeah.
- No, don't cry.
Everything will work out, you'll see.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
It's been so long since anybody's touched me.
Come here.
- Alan?
- Yeah?
It's been so long since anybody's touched me.
How much did you see?
Just enough to make sleep impossible.
Okay, that's great.
I am dying to talk about this.
All we did was kiss, but, Charlie, what a kiss.
It was like our souls were merging.
- That was saliva, Alan.
- No, seriously.
I mean, Frankie is incredible.
Think about it.
First she loses her husband, then she has to fight to keep her daughter, and yet, still she has such incredible spirit, such joie de vivre.
Okay, would you like to hear my take on this?
Is it positive and life affirming?
Good night, Alan.
Okay, no.
Tell me what you think.
All right.
I've known you all your life, and if there's one thing I've noticed, you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress.
- I am not.
- Come on, Alan.
Every woman you've ever been involved with has been damaged and needy.
Wait, what about...
Okay, go on.
You devote all your time and energy into fixing them up instead of doing the humane thing, which is to have sex with them and run away.
Exactly how is that the humane thing?
My way, they have a good time, you have a good time, nobody suffers.
Your way, you get married, you take over their lives, they start to hate you, and you end up moving in with me.
You know what, Charlie?
I think you're jealous.
- Of who?
- Of me.
For the first time in our lives, a woman picked me over you, and you can't deal with it.
I can deal with it.
I don't get it, but I can deal with it.
I feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry that your heart has become so hard and small that you've lost the capacity to connect with another human being on any level any more meaningful than the inebriated exchange of bodily fluids.
Boy, leave it to you to take a beautiful thing like drunken sex and make it sound dirty.
I don't know why I even bother talking to you.
- Alan?
- What?
I thought we had a pact to never go to bed mad.
Leave me alone.
Come on.
Don't you want to spoon?
I swear to God, you are going to lose that hand.
- That's not my hand.
- Mom!
- Do you know where Jake is?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.
- We're playing hide-and-seek.
- I don't know where he's hiding.
No, I was hiding, and he was supposed to find me.
It's been over an hour.
- If I see him, I'll let him know.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Morning.
- Coffee?
- Thank you.
So, I thought maybe today, you, me, and the kids might go do something fun.
- What about Charlie?
- He's had his fun.
I know.
Why don't we go to Will Rogers State Park and have a picnic?
- That sounds nice.
- Great.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Oh, man.
I'm the extra guy.
Don't call yourself extra.
- Try superfluous.
- Alan.
- Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple.
- Alan!
Interesting.
- What's interesting?
- This is new for me.
Don't really like it.
- Charlie, you're a great guy.
- No, please, stop.
Do not call me a great guy.
That's what you call the schmuck loser friend who has to dance with the hot chick's ugly cousin.
- What?
- Nothing.
Just having a really good day.
- Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?
- No.
Couldn't find a date.
Jake,
Mom wants to know if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.
- Tuna.
- Me, too.
God, she's annoying.
At least you're not a third nipple.
Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen and help Joanie pick out some snacks for the picnic basket?
You sure you don't want to come with us?
- Do you really want me to come with you?
- No, I was just being polite.
Listen, Frankie, we need to talk about you and Alan.
Come on, stud.
- You're not jealous, are you?
- No.
Dumbfounded, maybe.
Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted, but not jealous.
I just want to make sure that you understand how vulnerable he is.
You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?
Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie, but I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich.
Okay, let me put it this way, my brother is crazy about you.
Well, I'm crazy about him, too.
No, you don't understand.
Alan's a nester.
He's already imagining the two of you walking through IKEA, picking out flatware and throw pillows.
- Come on.
- He did it with me.
You really care about him, don't you?
Yes.
You're a great guy, Charlie.
Great guy and a kiss on the cheek.
Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?
- Want to play tag?
- No.
- Hide-and-seek?
- No.
- Want to chase me?
- No.
- The kids are having a great time.
- This is a wonderful idea, Alan.
Thank you.
Hey, what makes it wonderful is the company.
Do you always say exactly the right thing?
I don't know.
I suppose I try to be sensitive to the moment and weigh my words so that they're emotional...
No, not always.
Listen, Frankie, I was thinking.
We get along so well, and our kids get along, and since neither one of us really has our own place...
Alan.
Absolutely not.
- But...
- No.
My life is such a mess, and I've got to straighten out a bunch of things before I can even think about a relationship.
Yes, you've got a lot of baggage, but it's nothing I can't get to the curb.
- What?
- It was something Charlie said.
I was hoping you'd know what it meant.
No.
Alan,
I talked to my brother in Seattle today, and he and his wife are going to put me and Joanie up for a while.
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.
'Cause, you know, I can enroll her in school there and get a job and start putting my life back together again.
Yeah, no.
That makes sense.
Sure.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
You're doing the right thing.
- Look on the bright side, Alan.
- What bright side?
You're going to get laid tonight.
Oh, boy.
I think I'm going to cry again.
Okay, hon, the cab's waiting.
Say goodbye to Jake.
- Bye, Jake.
- Bye.
Oh, man!
- Charlie, what can I say?
- I know.
I'm a great guy.
Oh, man!
You know, I would've been happy to drive you to the airport.
No, it's better to say goodbye here, because LAX is hectic and crazy, and the underwire in my bra always sets off the metal detectors.
You know, this doesn't have to be goodbye forever.
Once we get all settled, you can come visit us.
Sure.
Bye.
Here, I'm running late.
- It's tough seeing her go, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I'm really going to miss Joanie.

It's been so long since anybody's touched me.
Come here.
- Alan?
- Yeah?
It's been so long since anybody's touched me.
How much did you see?
Just enough to make sleep impossible.
Okay, that's great.
I am dying to talk about this.

It was like our souls were merging.
- That was saliva, Alan.
- No, seriously.

Okay, no.
Tell me what you think.

I've known you all your life, and if there's one thing I've noticed, you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress.
- I am not.

You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Morning.
Morning.
- Coffee?
- Thank you.
So, I thought maybe today, you, me, and the kids might go do something fun.
- What about Charlie?
- He's had his fun.
I know.
Why don't we go to Will Rogers State Park and have a picnic?
- That sounds nice.
- Great.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Oh, man.
I'm the extra guy.
Don't call yourself extra.
- Try superfluous.
- Alan.
- Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple.
- Alan!
Interesting.
- What's interesting?
- This is new for me.
Don't really like it.
- Charlie, you're a great guy.
- No, please, stop.
Do not call me a great guy.
That's what you call the schmuck loser friend who has to dance with the hot chick's ugly cousin.
- What?
- Nothing.
Just having a really good day.
- Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?
- No.
Couldn't find a date.
Jake,
Mom wants to know if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.
- Tuna.
- Me, too.
God, she's annoying.
At least you're not a third nipple.
Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen and help Joanie pick out some snacks for the picnic basket?
You sure you don't want to come with us?
- Do you really want me to come with you?
- No, I was just being polite.
Listen, Frankie, we need to talk about you and Alan.
Come on, stud.
- You're not jealous, are you?
- No.
Dumbfounded, maybe.
Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted, but not jealous.
I just want to make sure that you understand how vulnerable he is.
You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?
Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie, but I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich.
Okay, let me put it this way, my brother is crazy about you.
Well, I'm crazy about him, too.
No, you don't understand.
Alan's a nester.
He's already imagining the two of you walking through IKEA, picking out flatware and throw pillows.
- Come on.
- He did it with me.
You really care about him, don't you?
Yes.
You're a great guy, Charlie.
Great guy and a kiss on the cheek.
Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?
- Want to play tag?
- No.
- Hide-and-seek?
- No.
- Want to chase me?
- No.
- The kids are having a great time.
- This is a wonderful idea, Alan.
Thank you.
Hey, what makes it wonderful is the company.
Do you always say exactly the right thing?
I don't know.
I suppose I try to be sensitive to the moment and weigh my words so that they're emotional...
No, not always.
Listen, Frankie, I was thinking.
We get along so well, and our kids get along, and since neither one of us really has our own place...
Alan.
Absolutely not.
- But...
- No.
My life is such a mess, and I've got to straighten out a bunch of things before I can even think about a relationship.
Yes, you've got a lot of baggage, but it's nothing I can't get to the curb.
- What?
- It was something Charlie said.
I was hoping you'd know what it meant.
No.
Alan,
I talked to my brother in Seattle today, and he and his wife are going to put me and Joanie up for a while.
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.
'Cause, you know, I can enroll her in school there and get a job and start putting my life back together again.
Yeah, no.
That makes sense.
Sure.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
You're doing the right thing.
- Look on the bright side, Alan.
- What bright side?
You're going to get laid tonight.
Oh, boy.
I think I'm going to cry again.
Okay, hon, the cab's waiting.
Say goodbye to Jake.
- Bye, Jake.
- Bye.
Oh, man!
- Charlie, what can I say?
- I know.
I'm a great guy.
Oh, man!
You know, I would've been happy to drive you to the airport.
No, it's better to say goodbye here, because LAX is hectic and crazy, and the underwire in my bra always sets off the metal detectors.
You know, this doesn't have to be goodbye forever.
Once we get all settled, you can come visit us.
Sure.
Bye.
Here, I'm running late.
- It's tough seeing her go, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I'm really going to miss Joanie.
English
Previously on Two and a Half Men.
That is a very sexy woman.
- So whose car is it?
- Psychiatrist.
Let's get out of here, Charlie.
You are not just going to leave me here, are you?
Here we are.
Chez Charlie.
- She's taking her clothes off.
- Is this a great country or what?
You guys are so cute.
Right back at you.
Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.
Hey, Charlie, you're a really cool guy.
But I'm not going to have sex with you.
Ever?
Deep tissue massage, pancakes.
If you had a TV on your forehead and could breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.
You just assume that if we are both interested in the same woman
- you would come out on top?
- Of course I would.
What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard I'll be an only child.
- Are you sure?
- It's settled.
You are staying with us.
Of course, we still don't know a damn thing about her.
I'm Joanie.
Hi.
We are going to go to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.
It's a wonderful place where those awful people will never find us.
So, Frankie, why didn't you tell us you had a daughter?
Okay, guys, here's the deal.
I didn't want you to know.
Okay.
I feel better.
I'm sorry, it's a long story.
We got time.
I'm not doing anything.
Alan, you doing anything?
No, I'm free.
I was staying with my grandma and grandpa, who are really rich, and they don't want my mom to have me, so they said she's crazy.
That wasn't so long.
- Can we please talk about this later?
- Okay.
What shall we talk about?
Are you guys gay?
Isn't she something?
Okay, here we are.
This is it, right?
One kid, no pets?
As far as I know.
- Can I go look at the ocean?
- Sure, just stay on the deck.
Okay, who has the first question?
- Alan.
- Thank you.
- What the hell is going on?
- Good one.
Here it is.
I married a really rich guy, and his parents always hated me.
I don't know.
Maybe it was because when we met, he was on the road to becoming a U.S. Congressman and I was just, you know, on the road.
Joanie, get off the railing.
Anyway, they were not happy when we got married, and they were even less happy when we used part of his trust fund to finance my recording career.
- You're a singer?
- Well, as it turns out, no.
But...
Then two years ago, Brad died.
And ever since, his parents have been trying to take Joanie away from me.
- So, the psychiatrist...
- Court ordered.
They're suing me for custody, saying I'm an unfit parent.
- Unfit, how?
- You know...
I'm not a lawyer, but taking a baseball bat to the shrink's Beamer might not have helped your case.
Yeah, they'll probably spin that one in their favor.
But I was screwed anyway because they were paying him to make me look bad.
- That's horrible.
- So what are your plans now?
I don't know.
I didn't think past just getting her out of there.
You don't have to know.
You can stay here for a while and figure it out.
Right?
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.
That'd be great.
I'll go tell Joanie.
Terrific.
We're happy to have you.
Okay, we've got to get her out of here.
- Charlie, she needs us.
- She doesn't need us.
She needs a lawyer and probably a new shrink.
Well, then we'll get her those.
At this point, I think I'd like to stop using the word "we. "
You're going to bail on her?
Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get her in bed.
That's because two days ago, she was just a crazy stranger.
If I remember correctly, you couldn't wait to get rid of her.
Yes, because she was a crazy stranger.
Now I've gotten to know her and I want her to stay.
All right, Alan, but I'm warning you.
This girl's got a lot of baggage.
I don't know if you have enough sky cabs to get her to the curb.
What?
So, Joanie, what grade are you in?
- Second.
- Really?
- I have a little boy who's in fourth.
- So?
I don't know.
I thought it'd be germane to the conversation.
Wow.
Doesn't matter how old they are, you still strike out.
You know, Joanie, you are just as pretty as your mom.
So?
I bow to the master.
Hold on, let me finish.
All right, I'm going to say this one more time real slow so there's no confusion.
You can take your damn money and stick it up your "white bread, country club,
"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.
Hi.
- Really?
I'm garbage.
- Is Alan here?
Really?
Is that right?
Well, I got news for you, lady.
The term is white trash.
- Do you know her?
- Nope, that's a new one.
- Hi, Dad.
- Jake, Judith.
What are you doing here?
Alan, I told you yesterday I was going to visit my parents.
Dad's having another colonoscopy.
If I'm not there, I'll have to watch the video.
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry.
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.
Yeah.
I just met your brother's latest stuff.
- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What?
Is it yours?
No, but it's not his, either.
- But it could be.
- Says who?
Says your ex-wife.
Okay, I really don't need to hear this.
Jake, honey, have a good time.
Charlie, behave yourself.
What about me?
I am completely capable of having my own stuff.
- Hi, I'm Joanie.
- Hey.
I'm going to go play in my room.
- Can I come with you?
- Whatever.
If he can just keep that attitude for another 30 years, he's gold.
I'm not afraid of your lawyers or your shrinks.
Fine, bring them on, because you know what?
We're going to run away and hide.
Now they're really unhappy with me.
- Is there anything we can do?
- Thanks, you've already done so much.
- I just hate to put you out like this.
- It is not a problem.
We have plenty of space.
You and Joanie can stay in my room and I'll bunk with Charlie.
You'll bunk with Charlie?
- Hold on there, Pecos Bill.
- No, it'll be fun.
It'll be like when we were kids.
Okay.
But just remember, this time Mom won't be around to hear you scream.
Why are those people here?
They're going through a tough time, and we're helping them out.
That girl is really annoying.
- I think maybe she has a crush on you.
- Yeah, that's what's annoying.
- You don't really like girls yet?
- No, I like girls.
Just not into eight-year-olds.
Is Joanie okay?
Yeah.
She fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.
- It was a long day for her.
- Yeah.
The good news is I think my in-laws are going to back off.
The bad news is that wasn't my shrink's car.
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.
But at least you made this one for the right reason.
You love your daughter.
I just wish I knew where to go from here.
Because I know I seem like I've got it all together,
- but this is a little...
- Scary?
Yeah.
I understand.
When my marriage ended, I was terrified.
It's the unknown.
- Yeah.
- No, don't cry.
Everything will work out, you'll see.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
It's been so long since anybody's touched me.
Come here.
- Alan?
- Yeah?
It's been so long since anybody's touched me.
How much did you see?
Just enough to make sleep impossible.
Okay, that's great.
I am dying to talk about this.
All we did was kiss, but, Charlie, what a kiss.
It was like our souls were merging.
- That was saliva, Alan.
- No, seriously.
I mean, Frankie is incredible.
Think about it.
First she loses her husband, then she has to fight to keep her daughter, and yet, still she has such incredible spirit, such joie de vivre.
Okay, would you like to hear my take on this?
Is it positive and life affirming?
Good night, Alan.
Okay, no.
Tell me what you think.
All right.
I've known you all your life, and if there's one thing I've noticed, you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress.
- I am not.
- Come on, Alan.
Every woman you've ever been involved with has been damaged and needy.
Wait, what about...
Okay, go on.
You devote all your time and energy into fixing them up instead of doing the humane thing, which is to have sex with them and run away.
Exactly how is that the humane thing?
My way, they have a good time, you have a good time, nobody suffers.
Your way, you get married, you take over their lives, they start to hate you, and you end up moving in with me.
You know what, Charlie?
I think you're jealous.
- Of who?
- Of me.
For the first time in our lives, a woman picked me over you, and you can't deal with it.
I can deal with it.
I don't get it, but I can deal with it.
I feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry that your heart has become so hard and small that you've lost the capacity to connect with another human being on any level any more meaningful than the inebriated exchange of bodily fluids.
Boy, leave it to you to take a beautiful thing like drunken sex and make it sound dirty.
I don't know why I even bother talking to you.
- Alan?
- What?
I thought we had a pact to never go to bed mad.
Leave me alone.
Come on.
Don't you want to spoon?
I swear to God, you are going to lose that hand.
- That's not my hand.
- Mom!
- Do you know where Jake is?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.
- We're playing hide-and-seek.
- I don't know where he's hiding.
No, I was hiding, and he was supposed to find me.
It's been over an hour.
- Lf I see him, I'll let him know.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Morning.
Morning.
- Coffee?
- Thank you.
So, I thought maybe today, you, me, and the kids might go do something fun.
- What about Charlie?
- He's had his fun.
I know.
Why don't we go to Will Rogers State Park and have a picnic?
- That sounds nice.
- Great.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Oh, man.
I'm the extra guy.
Don't call yourself extra.
- Try superfluous.
- Alan.
- Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple.
- Alan!
Interesting.
- What's interesting?
- This is new for me.
Don't really like it.
- Charlie, you're a great guy.
- No, please, stop.
Do not call me a great guy.
That's what you call the schmuck loser friend who has to dance with the hot chick's ugly cousin.
- What?
- Nothing.
Just having a really good day.
- Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?
- No.
Couldn't find a date.
Jake,
Mom wants to know if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.
- Tuna.
- Me, too.
God, she's annoying.
At least you're not a third nipple.
Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen and help Joanie pick out some snacks for the picnic basket?
You sure you don't want to come with us?
- Do you really want me to come with you?
- No, I was just being polite.
Listen, Frankie, we need to talk about you and Alan.
Come on, stud.
- You're not jealous, are you?
- No.
Dumbfounded, maybe.
Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted, but not jealous.
I just want to make sure that you understand how vulnerable he is.
You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?
Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie, but I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich.
Okay, let me put it this way, my brother is crazy about you.
Well, I'm crazy about him, too.
No, you don't understand.
Alan's a nester.
He's already imagining the two of you walking through IKEA, picking out flatware and throw pillows.
- Come on.
- He did it with me.
You really care about him, don't you?
Yes.
You're a great guy, Charlie.
Great guy and a kiss on the cheek.
Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?
- Want to play tag?
- No.
- Hide-and-seek?
- No.
- Want to chase me?
- No.
- The kids are having a great time.
- This is a wonderful idea, Alan.
Thank you.
Hey, what makes it wonderful is the company.
Do you always say exactly the right thing?
I don't know.

I'm really going to miss Joanie.
English
- Okay, did you confirm the wedding photography?
- Check.
- The videographer?
- Check.
- The stenographer.
- Check.
No, there is no stenographer at a wedding.
You failed the test!
You failed.
Okay, ladies, we are 72 hours away from my wedding.
And so far, I'm not very impressed with my bridal party.
What is this?
You call this a wedding favor?
I call this garbage!
Hey, I thought you said we get to eat the rejects.
Val, relax, your wedding is gonna be perfect.
You're right, you're right.
Oh, it's just, you know, you only get married once, and I guess this whole thing's just had me so stressed out.
Really?
You hide it so well!
Val, we are in the home stretch.
The caterer's all taken care of, the flowers are all set...
You picked up my wedding dress...
Isn't it nice when sisters hug?
- You didn't pick up my dress?
- Sorry.
What about you?
You were hired as her backup!
Isn't it nice when best friends hug?
What is wrong with you two?
This is my bridal gown, the center of my wedding universe.
It is the sun -- without which, all things die.
Starting with you two!
Okay, I left five messages for your dressmaker.
I'm sure that Gittle will call you back.
Yeah, I'm sure she just, you know, took a little vacation, went out partying.
A 95-year-old Russian immigrant?
Well, they do like their vodka.
Hi, uh, we're here to see Gittle.
She's in the living room.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Obviously, all that partying caught up with her.
âª You really know how to dance âª âª When you go up, down, jump around âª âª Talk about true romance âª âª Yeah âª

Did you find the dress?
Why aren't you holding the dress?
Why aren't you holding the dress?
I searched all her closets and her bedroom, and all I found were housecoats and a poster of Jude Law.
Holly, I want my dress.
I want my beautiful, one-of-a-kind strapless dress that took three months to make.
The woman lives to 95.
She can't hold out one more freaking week?
- Hey...
- Did you find it?
Totally scored.
I found these woozy pills in her medicine cabinet.
What?
She's taken the ultimate muscle relaxer.
Okay, Val, don't worry.
I am your maid of honor.
We're gonna find your dress, okay?
It's gotta be here somewhere.
It's not like she was buried in it.
No.
She wouldn't.
I'm going in.
Oh, Gittle!
Gittle!
Gittle!
Why is it always the good ones?
Navy blue with ruffles.
I'm gonna go mingle, see what I can find out.
[ whimpers ]
How could this happen?
Gone, just like that.
I know.
She was a great woman.
So thoughtful, so wise... and not afraid to try new things in bed.
It's a shame how she went, isn't it?
Yeah.
How was that exactly?
In her sleep.
Aww...well, at least it was peaceful.
Not really.
She was driving at the time.
All right, hey, listen, I talked to the old guy.
Yeah, that narrows it down.
Well, it seems as though the family took all the clothes in the apartment and donated them to a thrift store in Queens.
A thrift store?
My beautiful dress is hanging next to polyester pants and old yellow bras?
[ cellular phone rings ]
Oh, my God, whose is that?
That's so inconsiderate.
[ ring ]
Hello?
Oh, God, okay, yes, I'll tell her.
What now?
That was the florist.
Um...
They can't get you your peach roses,
- so how about yellow?
- How about no?
My color scheme is "First Harvest Peach,"
not "pee-pee yellow."
Mint?
No.
Don't try to drug me.
I need to have all of my strength when I rip that florist a new one!
Okay, you and Lauren go rip the florist a new one,
I'll grab the guys, and we'll go to that thrift shop in Queens.
Okay, good, there's a lot of old in here.
Let's beat it before another one of 'em goes.
And now if you'd join us in the dining room for a small buffet.
Okay.
Lauren!
Come on, let's go, we're gonna miss the shrimp.
Let's go!
Wow, now I know where the '70s came to die.
Are you kidding?
This stuff is... dyn-o-mite!
J.J., we need to focus.
We are looking for a strapless, beaded bodice.
You understand, we only know "pretty" or "ugly."
And when we're drunk, either one is fine, am I right?
Don't laugh at that.
Hello.
Hello.
And a special hello to you, Popeye.
Hi, I am looking for a wedding dress.
You aren't going to marry him, are you?
Because that would make me sad.
Okay, she scares me a lot.
Wedding dresses are over there.
We've got a lot of treasures in here.
And just remember, anything slightly used can be made beautiful again with a little spit... and polish.
[ sing-song ] Popeye has a girlfriend...
Shut up, Ben.
Uh, guys... check this out.
I think it's a phone.
Hey, look at this.
By the time you finish dialing 911, you're dead.
[ mocking ] Ha ha ha.
Okay, maybe I should've brought three puppies to help me, because they would've had more concentration.
Come on, we have to find the dress.
Now, you see, if more women wore wedding dresses like this, more men would be marrying women.
It's not here, it's not here.
Excuse me, miss.
Do you have a specific wedding dress?
It's a...
[ All ]:
Strapless, beaded bodice.
Oh, of course, it's beautiful.
And gone.
I sold it.
What, you sold it?
Why -- why would you sell it?
So I don't have to eat cat food.
Well, who bought the dress?
We need to speak to them.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't give out customer information.
We get a lot of celebrities here.
Hey, guys, we have to get that address.
How about it, Popeye?
Damn this face and body.
What am I gonna do?
Val has been planning this wedding since she was 10.
She has pictured the dress, she's pictured the roses...
Did she picture her fiancé with another woman?
What?
Hey, that is Rick at the pizza place.
Oh, my God.
[ gasps ] He's with Julie.
Julie?
Ex-fiancée Julie?
That scum.
Holly, I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation why he came all the way out to Queens to share a slice of pizza with his once almost-wife two days before he gets married.
The reason is, he's scum!
Oh, my God, I can't believe him.
What could Rick be doing?
Apparently Julie.
Is that helpful?
This is really gonna kill Val.
Hey, Holly, calm down.
For all you know, Rick told Val that he's having lunch with Julie.
And you might be able to clear that up right now.
Look who's coming.
Did you find my dress?
Do they have my dress?
- Where is it?
- Okay, funny story...
Uh, just know that's how the florist started with her, and he's still got an ice pack on his groin, so...
Okay, look, they sold your dress.
Oh, my God.
Ooh, my back's tightening.
Okay, no, don't stress.
Don't stress.
You know what happens when you stress.
Apparently, I'm stressing because now it's spasming.
Don't spasm.
No need to spasm.
Hey, Lauren, you got any more of those mints?
No.
No, my family is flying in for the holidays, and I am really gonna need to freshen my breath then.
Okay, Vince is getting the address of the girl who bought it, and we're gonna go get it.
They sold it?
Oh, my God.
Hey, um, your back doesn't seem to be getting any better.
Maybe you should call Rick and have him come pick you up.
No, he can't.
He's in New Jersey all day on business.
Is that what he told you -- New Jersey?
That scum!
What?
There's just quite a bit of scum in New Jersey.
Okay.
I got the address.
And now I feel dirty and cheap.
Okay, great, let's go.
Let's go get it.
No, no, we can't.
We have to bring the photographer his check at 4:00.
How are we supposed to do both?
Okay, stop.
Ben and I will drop off the check with the photographer.
Gary and Vince will pick up your dress.
Lauren's gonna take you home, and you're gonna get your back massager and actually use it on your back, okay?
Everybody know what they have to do?
Ready, break!
Ooh, on the way home, can we stop at that pizza place across the street?
- No!
No pizza place!
- Why not?
- Because, uh, I need to talk to you about something.
- Can't it wait?
- No, no, no, it can't wait.
See, um...
- What?
Is it weird if I... look at other girls and have feelings?
What?
[ whispers ] Rick and Julie just got in a cab.
Okay, you know what?
It's over.
That phase has passed.
Let's go.
Um, is it weird?
24C.
This is it.
All right, so how do we do this?
We just ask for the wedding dress back?
Well, let me see, in my all experience asking for wedding dresses back -
- I don't know!
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.
All right.
- She's wearing it.
- I see.
How are you doing?
Uh, I'm Vince.
I...uh...tell her why we're here, Gar.
Hi.
Ha.
Um...
Are we -- are we interrupting anything holy?
Oh, no, I'm getting married in a few days.
My mother's just hemming my dress.
Okay, well, you see, that's why we're here.
Um, yeah, about your dress... now, uh... tell her, Vince.
Uh, see, the thing is, it was accidentally donated to the store where you bought it, and we kinda need it back.
[ Woman ]:
Who is it, Nikki?
It's about the dress, Ma.
They want it back.
Who wants what back?
Wow, okay, um, ahem... see, this was our friend Val's dress, and through a series of bad circumstances, it ended up at a thrift store where you...
Paid good money for it, and it's ours.
Go stir the sauce, Nikki.
Yeah, b-but it was Val's first.
And this dress -- it means everything to her.
And she's getting married in a few days.
Now, to be honest with you, the woman hasn't had the best of luck with men.
I mean, the first one --
Luck with men?
My daughter used to weigh 230 pounds.
I went all the way to the Vatican to pray she'd stop eating like a pig and find a husband.
A week later, she got in a fight at the bowling alley and wound up with her jaw wired shut.
Thank God.
And 75 pounds later, she met her fiancé.
It was a miracle, as was finding this dress.
So, you see, I ain't giving it up.
Listen, you look like a reasonable... moderately attractive woman.
I know --
Well, looks like Popeye lost his pretty.
Okay, I'm just gonna ask you one last time.
Are you sure you want to tell Val about Rick and Julie?
Well, she deserves to know.
She's marrying him in three days.
But if you never see me again, you can have my chicken at the wedding.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, I ordered 50 chickens and 85 salmon.
There are only 84 salmon here.
I'm missing salmon.
I can't believe I'm missing a salmon!
You're missing a lot more than a salmon.
Hey, um, how are you doing?
Are you still in pain?
Oh, well, sometimes I black out, and that's a nice relief.
There's something I have to tell you.
Oh, God, they called.
They can't find the dress, right?
No, no, it's on its way.
What I wanted to tell you, um...
What?
Okay.
Hypothetically speaking, if there was a tidal wave heading towards New York, would you want to know it was coming, or would you prefer to be surprised and see if you survive?
Are there any salmon in this tidal wave?
[ knock on door ]
One wedding dress for Miss Val Tyler.
Oh, it's here!
Let me see her, let me see her.
Yeah, oh, I wanna hug you.
- Aww...
- Not you, the dress!
Bam!
What the hell is that?
Well, something old, something new, something borrowed, something eww.
Where is my dress?
Well, we tried to get it back, but there was a scary Italian lady who says she knows the Pope and we had to kiss his feet, and I ain't kissing no old man's feet.
- Oh, my wedding is ruined!
- Okay, look, it's not gonna be ruined by a dress.
There's a lot of, um, other things that can ruin weddings.
No, Holly, it's not just the dress.
It's the flowers, the napkins, the salmon!
These are all omens.
I'm gonna go upstairs and go to bed.
Maybe I'll have that recurring nightmare where I'm naked at my wedding.
Oh, wait, I will be.
You know what?
She'll be fine.
She just needs a house call from her doctor.
Johnny Walker, M.D.
Holly, we're sorry.
We really did try to get the dress back.
I know, and I appreciate it.
Would you mind giving me some time alone?
I have to figure out this whole Rick and Julie thing.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
What?
Well, it's just that the dress cost us 100 bucks.
But that's cool.
Pay us when you can.
- Hey, Rick.
- Ha ha!
First time today I've seen you.
Yeah, and now we're leaving... to go have pizza -- not that that means anything in particular.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Is Val around?
I just got this message on my cell about the dress and her back...
Uh-huh, yeah, she's upstairs.
Her back is still pretty messed up.
That's all the stress from planning this wedding.
She's taking on too much.
Oh, right, well, maybe it's just because she loves you so much, and she just wants everything to be perfect.
I love her, too.
Right.
So, um...
how was New Jersey?
New Jersey was New Jersey.
Yeah...that's funny.
I forgot, how do you usually get to New Jersey?
Is there a shortcut through a pizza place in Queens?
What?
I saw you and Julie today.
And don't you think about having me whacked, because Gary, Vince, and Ben saw you, too.
Okay, Holly, listen, Julie called me and said she wanted to give me her blessing.
She said that it would help her have closure.
I left her at the altar, Holly.
I owed her that.
Okay, if it's all so innocent, then why didn't you just tell Val?
Have you met your sister?
Her eye twitched for three days when she found out the wedding singer didn't know any Michael Bolton.
Okay, this is so not the same thing.
I mean, if it wasn't that big of a deal, then --
Holly, there's nothing to worry about, okay?
Rick!
Oh, I thought I heard you down here.
[ knock on door ]
I've had the worst day.
Everything is falling apart.
I'm so glad you're here.
Hey, um, Val, this is Nikki.
She's here about the dress.
Hi, I found out where you lived from the thrift store lady.
Oh, please, God, let that be my dress.
Yeah, I got to thinking about what those two guys said about how this was your dream dress.
I can't take that away from you.
Oh...
We didn't have a lot of money after my father's operation.
So finding it was like a miracle.
And it was a miracle that I fit into it.
I don't know if you heard, but I used to tip in at 230.
Oh, my God, did you go to Camp Chubby-Wubby in Great Neck?
No.
Me neither.
Well, anyway, it really is a beautiful dress.
I felt like Cinderella in it.
So, what are you gonna do for a wedding dress?
Back to the thrift store.
But at least I'm still marrying a great guy.
Oh, this guy -- he's like chocolate chip cheesecake with fudge sauce drizzled on top.
No, he's like a glazed doughnut that when you bite into it, all of a sudden, peanut butter shoots out.
Somebody's obsessed with carbs.
A total surprise, you know?
Just like me finding love.
'Cause, you know, that's what this is all about -- love.
It doesn't matter about the dresses or the fish or chicken or overbearing mothers... when you find your soul mate, nothing else matters.
You know what?
She's right.
This is about you and me.
Yes.
So let's get past the wedding and on to our marriage because I can't wait.
Oh, my God, you got a good one, too.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
I'm sorry.
I've been such an idiot.
Thank you.
Oh, my pleasure.
Well, look, I better get going.
The thrift store closes in an hour.
Maybe I'll find another miracle dress.
Have a happy life.
Uh... wait a minute.
You forgot something.
Oh, no way.
No...you just gave me something, and I want to give you something.
Are you serious?
Oh, my God.
Do you know what you are?
You are a hot chocolate soufflé on a cold winter's night.
Oh, thank you so much!
Now I'm gonna get out of here really fast before you change your mind.
Hey, you got a good one, too.
Bye!
Hey, Val, that was really sweet what you did.
No, it was really sweet what you guys did putting up with me today.
- Today?
- Today?
You know, I didn't think it was possible, but I think I love you even more.
Aww...that's really sweet.
Very touching.
Now, what the hell are you gonna wear to your wedding?
Lauren, we're having a moment here, all right?
Okay, moment over.
I have no dress, ladies.
Let's go.
Bergdorf's closes in an hour.
- I'll meet you right outside.
- Okay, bye, see ya!
What you said about Julie makes sense,
- but something still just doesn't feel right.
- Holly --
But she's happy, so I'm not gonna say anything.
But if you ever hurt my sister... it'll be a lot harder than that.
As far as I can remember,
I've hated Christmas.
What does it say, Christian?
Gimme my car!
Christmas 1960
It should work.
Stop picking your nose.
It's working!
There we go.
Mine's not moving.
Gervais!
Han?
How are you feeling?
He's so cute!
Look, kids.
It's your little brother!
- Baby Jesus!
- Let me hold him.
Here you go.
He's beautiful.
Let me see!
Christmas 1966
Not only would my birthday always go unnoticed, but it had to start with midnight mass.
Midnight mass is too long!
Go home and open your presents!
On the contrary, you're lucky to share his birthday.
That doesn't happen to just anyone.
It's special.
Hence the birthmark on your scalp.
Hmm?
It's a sign of being gifted, you know.
At least, after mass, there was the Christmas Eve party at Grandma's.
Hello, my beautiful Zac.
The only advantage to having one's birthday on Christmas was getting a bigger present than everyone else.
He likes it, huh?
But I especially hated Christmas because I never got what I wanted.
Dammit.
It's what he wanted.
So?
It's not up to him.
You want to turn him into a fairy?
- Stop it.
He's only five!
- He's almost six and looks seven.
- Oh, come on!
- Never mind "come on."
Now return it.
Go on.
It would make you a laughingstock, son.
Daddy doesn't want that.
Daddy isn't trying to upset you.
He loves you far too much.
Hence the hockey game.
So he can play with you.
Go to sleep.
Mommy will have a nice surprise for you soon.
- For my birthday?
- No, after.
You'll see.
Go to sleep.
What's a fairy?
Nothing.
Hogwash.
Go to sleep.
Idiot.
I knew very well what a fairy was.
I especially knew...
I didn't want to be one.
Want to play, Zac?
No.
Unlike my friends' fathers, all of whom were ordinary and uninteresting, mine was the best in the world.
He has Patsy Cline's, Buddy Rich's and Aznavour's entire collections.
He fired a machine gun in the army.
Our secret side trips to Norm The King Of Fries made me deliriously happy.
For a few precious moments, I was his favourite.
Take me
To the ends of the earth
Take me
To Wonderland
It seems to me
That misery
Would be borne more easily under the sun
Hi!
Hello.
- You didn't bring any back?
- What?
Fries, you moron.
You can smell it a mile away.
We didn't have any fries.
Did we?
My three brothers were morons.
Starting with Christian, the egghead, who read constantly - anything, anytime, anywhere;
Antoine, the sports nut, a walking stinkbomb;
- What're you looking at?
- And Raymond, my sworn enemy.
Get lost, you pisser.
Dad, Raymond called me a pussy!
Not a pussy, a pisser.
Kitchen.
I could understand him being proud of Christian, or Antoine.
But Raymond?
Aren't you going to introduce us?
My dad.
- You're going out, Raymond?
- The little bastard's a Casanova.
But he asked for more ironed toast!
Hi, pretty baby.
After nine months of prayer... and superhuman feats... the good Lord would finally give me...
Another boy?
What kind of lead you got in your pencil, Beaulieu?
What can I say?
I have a surplus of male hormones.
- A surplus of hormones!
- That's irrelevant.
He has to change positions once in a while.
Yeah, well, I've tried that.
What can I say?
Five boys - you take what you can get.
Come on, Zac.
You like my surprise?
Christmas 1967
Take me
To the ends of the earth
Take me
To Wonderland
It seems to me that misery
Would be borne more easily under the sun
Drop by sometime.
See?
Look.
Again.
Zac has a gift.
I'm sure of it.
His colic stops whenever Zac holds him.
I'll go see Mrs. What's-her-name, the Tupperware lady.
She, too, has a gift.
She can staunch bleeding, heal burns and everything.
She'll tell us if he's gifted.
No.
You've seen how he plays the drums.
A regular little Buddy Rich.
Music runs in his blood, I'm telling you.
That's his gift.
He gets that from his old man.
Hi, pretty baby.
Mommy's little darling.
I can still remember the snow slowly melting on his face.
I had just turned seven and, unwittingly, declared war to my father.
Are you crazy, dammit?
!
What are you doing?
!
Roll that window back up, you nitwit!
Do we have to tie you up?
Here, buckle up!
Christ.
Use your head, you nitwit.
Stop slurping, you pig!
Don't be such a sissy!
Eleven bucks!
An imported collector's record.
You'll each reimburse me if the guilty party doesn't come forward.
I'm warning you.
I'll teach you to take responsibility for your actions, dammit!
- Gervais!
I didn't do it.
It was an accident.
Scoot, you three.
You'll not only pay for the record, but your lies, too.
I'll teach you, you'll see.
Go to your room!
He said it was an accident.
What in heaven's name did you do to him?
Zac.
He's changed.
He's a crybaby, he dresses like a girl.
It's not normal.
Get over it.
It's you who's not normal.
He's a child, for God's sake.
Let him be.
"What did I do to him"!
- The others weren't like that.
- Each of them is different.
Zac is more gentle, that's all.
More sensitive.
He's not gentler, he's softer.
God, please don't let me be soft.
And return my dad to his old self.
Shut up.
Use your head, you nitwit!
Don't be such a sissy!
I did it on purpose.
I'll tell Dad, you pisser.
When will I stop wetting the bed?
I've been asking him a long time.
Never mind - no harm done.
Hmm?
You're not alone.
It'll stop eventually.
Keep praying.
You'll see, Baby Jesus will hear you.
Especially you.
You were born on the same day.
Sweet dreams.
Big chimneys, huh?
Where are we going?
You'll see.
Careful.
Mrs. What's-her-name, the Tupperware lady, had realized my mother's dream:
she had walked in Christ's footsteps.
Try to trust your feelings.
You can feel things others can't.
You mustn't fear it.
He's been blessed from on high, Mrs. Beaulieu.
The good Lord chose him knowing he was strong enough for what's expected of him.
But give him a chance to grow up a bit.
Hmm?
So he better understands.
He's a good-looking boy.
He'll go far.
Christ...mas, I'm bushed!
I've got news for you.
Your son has a gift.
A family's seventh child of the same sex is gifted.
With my three miscarriages, that makes Zac seventh.
Who says your miscarriages were boys?
They must've been.
That's all you can do.
We knew he could stop colic, but he's otherwise gifted.
Gifted people can pass their gift on to others, if they're of the opposite sex and not related.
Mrs. What's-her-name passed all of hers on to him.
Oh, Jesus.
How much Tupperware did that cost you?
None.
She didn't try selling me any.
I bought some.
It's different.
This is no joke.
He's truly gifted!
Can your gift cure my headache?
There.
What's this?
Look.
It's not my birthday, as far as I know.
Your record's unfindable.
We bought another.
It's the same thing!
I know.
I already have this one.
The sound's not the same.
An imported collector's record isn't the same.
It's the thought that counts.
I'll just return it, then.
Raymond, Antoine!
That's enough!
Christian!
Supper's ready.
Come on, boys.
Let's eat.
- Coming.
Gifted...
What do you think about that?
What did Mrs. What's-her-name tell you?
I'm not allowed to say.
But she told Mom that if the good Lord gave me a gift,
I had to use it.
That I could help a lot of people, even save them.
Tell him to think of him.
Think of Uncle Lucien.
He cut himself eating steak.
They're not going to start calling for every little booboo?
Turn that music down.
All I had to do was silently recite the secret little prayers imparted to me by Mrs. What's-her-name, which consisted not of asking, but of commanding God to heal.
Remember, you can't use your gift for personal gain.
Or to harm others.
What a shame.
What's he saying?
He's not allowed to say.
Stop it, will you?
From now on, it'll cost a dime every time you pick your nose.
You'll be rich.
You must know how ketchup's made by now, you've been reading the damn label for half an hour.
Another pest who just cut himself shaving.
Okay, I'll tell him.
Uncle Lucien's bleeding has stopped.
Yes?
Well, I'll be damned.
Great.
He'll be thrilled.
Yes.
Thank you.
What is it?
Your lucky brother is going to summer camp.
- What?
!
I wasn't allowed to go at his age!
You got yours.
Stop complaining.
We've never sent our children to camp.
He'll sleep there?
Of course.
He'll make friends, have lots of fun...
It'll be a good experience for him.
- He'll always remember it.
- I don't wanna go.
Oh, come on.
I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go!
God, please don't let it happen.
Go to sleep.
God, please, don't let it show.
I'll never miss mass again.
Midnight mass was so short and sweet now that I'd become an atheist.
I'd kept my promise, though.
I'd never missed mass...
midnight mass.
Once a year.
It made her happy.
It kept his mouth shut.
You dragging your trash around, brother-in-law?
It's your present.
Well, if it isn't Zac!
What, no girlfriend yet?
Christmas 1975
Nice paper.
Every year, I told them:
No Christmas wrapping paper for my birthday presents, okay?
That's not what matters.
After the drum set, accordion, guitar and violin... a banjo.
You said to surprise you.
It's so hard to know what teenagers want nowadays.
You try to please them...
Some fantasies are worth keeping.
Merry Christmas!
Happy New Year!
You know what time it is, Raymond?
You're late.
I was starting to worry.
- Hi.
I'm Doris.
- Good evening.
- Merry Christmas.
- Take off your boots.
- How are you?
- Hi, Dad.
- Merry Christmas.
- Pleased to meet you.
I'm Raymond's mother.
My family always appreciated gourmet food.
Did you at least make a wish?
It won't come true, he can't get it up yet.
My brothers hadn't changed a bit.
Dad, Zac gave him the finger!
- Except my darling Yvan.
- Such brotherly love!
And how polite they are in public.
Turn that music down.
Every Christmas, the bastard barely stayed an hour.
Just long enough to stuff himself... and to piss me off.
Here, buy whatever you want.
Happy birthday.
Wait.
I loved daydreaming about my mother.
Picturing myself wealthy, so that, one day, I could spoil her.
Merry Christmas!
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh, what a lovely dress.
My cousin Brigitte had just dropped out of school to devote herself to social dancing full-time.
At the age of 15.
I can dance too, you know!
But it's not my specialty.
Back by popular request...
No getting around it.
It's your birthday!
- You've really changed.
- Yeah, you too.
This is my boyfriend, Paul.
My cousin, Zac.
He has his driver's license!
I'm stealing one.
- You don't smoke?
- Never touch the stuff.
Good thing.
If it was up to him, he'd be smoking nonstop.
We go to the movies, he wants to smoke;
we go skating, he wants to smoke...
You skate?
Roller-skate?
The guys' turn, full blast, music blaring, really stoned - you let yourself go...
you can hear everything, and feel like everything around you is moving in slow-motion,
like in a movie.
A stoner movie, yeah.
Try it.
Give me a shotgun.
No way.
Are you nuts?
I burned my tongue last time.
I thought of you and it stopped burning.
He has a gift for healing burns.
- What?
- And staunching blood.
It's true!
Tell him!
My mother got that into the whole family's head.
You stop your girlfriend's monthly bleeding, too?
Idiot.
That's it, make a fool of me.
I don't believe in that anymore.
Sorry.
That doesn't mean you've lost your blessing.
You blessed fool!
You want a shotgun?
Boy, have you changed!
Well, well...
if it isn't the lovely Michelle.
- Hi, Mr. Beaulieu.
- Hi.
I'll finish up later.
No problem.
- Is she really on the pill?
- Enough about my cousin.
I'm not the one who wants to sleep with her.
That's the last time I confide in you.
Why are the prettiest girls always the dumbest?
You've never seen her.
I've seen her picture.
Enough said.
Don't be jealous.
You're dumb too.
I see her once a year.
How am I supposed to sleep with her?
Anyway, she's got a boyfriend.
Older.
As dumb as she is.
Not as dumb as you?
Don't.
It'll ruin our friendship.
That's not what you said last week.
Stop it.
See what happens?
Absolutely nothing!
Don't tell me he groped her.
You done imitating that fucking fag?
Huh?
!
You're making us look like a bunch of idiots!
Get outta here!
It's my room too!
C'mon, Toto, ask him for an autograph.
Got a problem?
No.
Having a crazy brother also had its advantages.
- Always ready to help...
- Pay up, you little bastard.
... for the modest sum of $2.
We were here first.
Shut up, faggot.
What did you call him?
Apologize.
Apologize and switch back to his show.
Apologize, I said!
It's okay, Dad.
Go on!
Sorry.
What's for dinner?
What happened to you?
Just a hockey fight.
- Didn't you have practice today?
- Yeah, yeah.
You fought with a teammate?
It was just a scuffle.
Didn't even drop my gloves.
- Who with?
- Tremblay.
You got beaten up by Tremblay's little fag?
What, you four-eyed fag?
What's with you always calling each other fags?
You'd swear we're nothing but a bunch of fairies!
Please... anything but that.
Sorry about last night.
You know I don't like you talking to your brother that way.
Yeah...
Okay, see you at work.
Careful, now.
Please let me bump into them.
What're you doing here?
- Just in the neighbourhood.
- God, you've changed.
What'd you do to your hair?
It's cool.
Thanks.
You alone?
- No, I'm with... my new dance partner.
He's Italian.
Thank you.
This is my cousin, Zac.
Okay, well...
I'll be off.
Change...
Change...
I would be cured of my asthma... if I only managed to get through.
For the second time of my life...
I was declared clinically dead... for three seconds.
Thank God you were dedicated to Virgin Mary.
I can't believe it.
It's a miracle.
You know you made your father cry?
Don't ever scare us like that again.
Feel like talking?
I'll come back later.
While my mother performed charitable works daily... her Baby Jesus had only one thing on his mind.
You asshole!
What're you doing?
!
Fucking liar.
The hottest was a black chick.
It was like she'd never eaten before.
Mind you, they smoked a couple of joints.
Makes you hungry.
She sucked him like a Hoover!
He held her head, thrusting as deep as he could.
The harder she sucked, the more he screamed.
The more he screamed, the harder she sucked.
Ever had a blow job?
What do you want?
I was wondering where my shades went.
Going somewhere?
Boy, is this gonna cost me!
I didn't ask for nothing.
Your neck still sore?
We're out of HP Sauce.
You get a 2-for-1 special today.
You'll learn to drive properly and how to make your father's world-class spaghetti sauce.
Let's go, before your mother catches us.
Go ahead.
Turn the key, put it on "D."
Good.
Slowly, now.
Go ahead.
- HP Sauce?
- That's my secret.
Watch where you're going and shut up.
Lesson number one:
shut up and drive.
Go ahead.
Slow down!
What are you, nuts?
What are you doing?
The school principal just called.
Seems your son's been spreading rumours about Raymond!
I won't stand for smut around here!
Much less drugs!
What?
If I have to call the police to make Raymond understand,
I'll do it this time!
What's all this about?
Huh?
!
What's this?
His little brothers live here!
Stay away from me, I said!
I didn't rat him out.
He's already gone.
I didn't even say goodbye.
Could be the wrong time, but can I have his room?
- I want it!
- No one's taking his room.
Especially not you.
Does this mean we're not just friends anymore?
I dunno.
What do you think?
What's he doing here?
Toto the Weirdo.
Forget him.
Peeping Tom.
What're you looking at?
!
Fucker.
She's so excited.
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.
She went on and on about Brigitte.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Seems she's putting together a big show with her boyfriend this Christmas Eve.
- With the Italian?
- No, she's back with the other.
The mambo dancer?
He missed her big knockers.
Who's the pig who ate all my lard spread?
Think of your little cousin Daniel;
he burned himself.
Too bad!
Rutting teenager in his natural habitat.
Shut up!
What teenager?
You didn't come just for my Tupperware?
How are you coping with your gift?
Beautiful story.
A man dreamed he was walking with Christ on the beach while watching scenes of his life flash across the sky.
Upon turning around, he noticed that throughout most of his life, there were two sets of footprints in the sand, his and those of Christ.
Except during the worst times of his life, when there was only one set of prints.
The man said to Jesus,
"You promised you would walk with me always.
Why did you forsake me when I needed you most?"
Jesus replied...
"There was only one set of footprints in the sand during the worst times of your life, because I carried you."
I want to be like everyone else.
Thank God, you never will.
What got into you?
!
You have to learn to control yourself!
I'm not going to the Christmas party this year.
The guy was twice his size.
The little bastard's got nerve.
He gets that from his old man.
He's been doing well lately, huh?
You call that doing well?
A little fight's no big deal.
We should get him something special this year, don't you think?
He just needed a girlfriend.
Michelle's a nice girl.
He said she invited him over for Christmas Eve.
He'll be 16.
We can start cutting him a little slack.
You didn't agree?
I said we'd discuss it.
She can join us, if she wants to spend Christmas with him.
She can't take him away from us on his birthday.
He can do whatever he wants when he's older.
In the meantime, we celebrate Christmas as a family.
What about a new stereo for his room?
I can't believe what a good ear he has.
He gets that from me, too.
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't take me for an idiot!
What you did was wrong!
I didn't do anything.
- A liar, too!
- Let him explain.
See what that pram business and your mollycoddling does?
He's never to set foot here again!
Is that clear?
!
If you can't choose the right friends, we'll do it for you.
Fucking little faggot.
And you, you sap, get dragged into it!
- Let him speak!
- Stop defending him!
I know what I saw!
What you did was wrong.
You don't do this.
We went in to warm up, that's all.
Did we ever beat you?
Do we have to start, so you stop mocking us!
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
After everything we've done for him.
This shouldn't be happening to us.
It can happen to anyone.
It's no one's fault.
Father Carbonneau says we mustn't seek to lay blame.
Father Carbonneau?
I had to talk to someone.
- What am I, chopped liver?
- You're impossible to talk to.
- The whole neighbourhood will know.
- Of course not.
No one else is to know about this.
Is that clear?
This is strictly a family matter.
What did the priest have to say?
It's a sin, yes, but not the end of the world.
He's not alone.
The sin is in the act, not the inclination.
Look who's talking.
Him and his cassock!
Don't start.
He says he knows a priest who's real good with teenagers.
Forget it.
It's not a priest he needs.
Sometimes I wonder why we pray to a long-haired guy who hangs out with a bunch of guys in robes.
- It's fishy.
- Honestly!
Why are there no female priests, then?
They're starting to get on my nerves.
Anyway, we'll take care of his problem immediately.
It's all in his head.
Abnormal people get treated.
People aren't born that way, they become so.
It's up to us to make sure that our son doesn't.
Nature doesn't make mistakes.
There's no in-between.
It's one or the other - a boy or a girl.
I'm willing to pay for a shrink if necessary.
Our boy is a boy.
No way I sired a fairy.
We'll wipe any such notions right out of his head!
You have to be sick to spend your life sticking your pecker up someone's ass!
You've got a short memory.
That was different.
And we only tried it once.
Once?
Once or twice.
I don't remember.
Well, I do.
I'm not seeing a shrink.
I'm warning you.
I don't have a problem.
Understand?
He does take after his father.
He's freaking out over nothing.
Nothing happened.
We didn't touch each other.
We jerked off in the same car, no big deal.
Why do it together, then?
Watching him excited you?
I didn't watch him.
Do I look like a fag?
Do I talk with a lisp?
Strut like a peacock?
Nice idea of homosexuals you've got there.
They're not all like that.
They all become that way.
Sooner or later.
This is a waste of time.
I'm not a fag.
I'd rather die.
It's just a figure of speech.
Isn't it obvious?
Being happy and healthy, or miserable and fucked-up?
It's a no-brainer.
So?
A subconsciously deliberate mistake.
What?
He says I deliberately did that in your car so you'd catch me, find out I was gay and accept it so that I could.
Twenty-five bucks for that hogwash?
You didn't buy it, I hope?
- 'Course not.
- Unbelievable.
"A subconsciously deliberate mistake"!
He'll deliberately reimburse me, believe me!
What do you want?
!
You want to take this in to him?
He'll be glad to see you.
I'm sure he's forgiven you.
Dad!
How are you?
Come in, come in.
What're you doing?
Get out of here.
I don't have time.
Your brother's waiting in the car.
I'll take a rain check.
Hey, bro.
How you doing?
So, you take my room, you little bastard?
Oh, Dad, I almost forgot.
Can you lend me a few bucks?
I couldn't cash my cheque.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.
Better than nothing.
See you.
I would be cured if I could simply make it through the storm.
Happy birthday.
Christmas 1980
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
The night...
When Christ was born
Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
He wrote that for you, Zac.
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won 't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
When I was young
Happy birthday, my man!
The old man's still got it, huh?
It's been a while since I've seen him with an inhaler.
He got rid of it.
Since when?
- Almost a year, I think.
- He didn't tell us?
I said nothing, okay?
I don't know about cake.
I overate.
We've got news.
I don't want to steal your thunder, bro, so I'll be quick.
We're getting married.
You hear that?
!
They're getting married!
I'm very happy!
This calls for another bottle!
Congratulations.
How about a double wedding, honey?
Sit down and shut up.
You look like a damn fool.
What's the matter?
What's going on?
Tell him to go to hell.
Shut up, fag.
You shut up.
You seem to be sniffing a lot for someone in detox.
Did I miss something?
Two subjects had become taboo at home:
me, and Raymond.
- Sucking cock's made you a prick?
That's enough!
Your ass must've been raw after prison.
He'd done a year for beating up a junkie who tried to steal his coke.
You'd have enjoyed that, huh?
That's quite enough!
It's Christmas!
Can't we eat in peace?
!
Idiots!
How sweet life was since I had become so happy and fulfilled.
Aw, Mom!
Yeah, that's right.
Don't call me back to say she's stopped bleeding.
She'll stop anyway, whether or not I think of her.
If I truly had a gift, by dint of being his instrument, perhaps he would one day answer my prayers.
Had I known, I wouldn't have come today.
I think... you won't come much anymore.
He says it's just for a couple of weeks.
Just long enough to get back on his feet.
To run through our savings, you mean.
Anyway, he seems determined.
I've never seen him like that.
I think, this time, he really wants to clean up his act.
Please, make an effort.
Your brother needs help.
So Michelle's well, then?
Yeah.
I brought your records back.
- Coffee?
- It's okay, Mom, I'll do it.
What's new?
Not much.
Classes, work.
So, were they a hit?
Your brother's playing my old records at his club.
Can you believe it?
If that's the nutcase, I'm not here.
No, he's busy.
Can he call you back?
That her?
It was for Yvan.
Is Doris the "nutcase"?
She was nuts to put up with you for six years, that's for sure!
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'll be out of your hair soon.
I missed... your delicious ironed toast.
I love you, Mom.
Any bacon left?
Well, I'll be going.
Already?
- Need a ride back?
- Never mind, Dad.
I'll go.
Coming?
It's disco?
Not just disco.
I play a bit of everything.
Anything unusual.
I'll come see you at some point.
I'll make an exception.
I don't drink anymore, so I avoid bars.
I don't drink, smoke or swear anymore.
Fuck, I left my bag of weed at the pub.
You can drop me at the corner.
Listen...
I know I haven't always been cool with you.
I need money.
I'll pay you back.
I don't know when, but I swear I will.
You're asking me?
The old man brags that his little pet makes more than he does.
If he's got a pet, it sure isn't me.
Don't be a prick, I'm in a jam.
Even if I was a millionaire, I wouldn't lend you a dime.
Antoine and Christian did.
Even Fatty spotted me 20.
Come on!
Do I have to give you a blow job?
That's it, go kill yourself.
Aren't you in bed yet?
Here.
Someone left this for you tonight.
G'night.
You want to get things hopping, give this tape to the DJ.
- Do I have to wear this?
- I want this off, too.
Bunch of nitwits.
A tux without a bow tie isn't a tux.
We're all dressed the same.
That's the beauty of it.
Huh?
Very nice.
Where have you been?
Fatty.
- Goddammit, Raymond!
- I'll pay you back.
Congratulations.
Aren't you going to introduce us?
My mother.
My brothers.
My father.
Min.
What's that?
Min.
He takes after his old man!
Is that idiot gonna play my tape or what?
Not dancing?
I'm waiting for my song.
By popular request...
Shall we go smoke one outside?
Good idea.
You two go ahead.
Michelle and I will have girl talk.
What is it?
Your girlfriend's nice.
She's cute, too.
You want a shotgun?
A coke.
Same.
I'm very proud of you.
What's so funny?
Check those two out.
Little Zac sure seems to like his cousin.
Talk about keeping it in the family!
He's not after his cousin, but her boyfriend.
I saw them French-kissing in the parking lot earlier.
So it's true.
Junior's a fag.
Looks like it.
Ah, damn.
Don't touch me!
Are you okay?
Keep dancing.
Just a little misunderstanding.
The wedding goes on.
Keep dancing.
No, everything's okay.
Keep dancing!
Christian!
I'm sorry!
What's going on?
!
Stop!
Give us a minute?
On your brother's wedding day!
Raymond causes trouble and I get in shit?
What happened was your fault.
Your brother was defending you.
You were being called a fag!
They saw you in the parking lot with your cousin's boyfriend!
What did they see?
It's not what you think.
We were smoking a joint.
We just gave each other a shotgun.
You're a born liar.
Nothing happened!
Be a man for once in your life and tell the truth!
What do you want to hear?
!
That I'm gay?
!
A fag?
!
That I suck cock?
!
Yes, something happened, but not with him!
You know with who.
Nothing happened earlier.
But I would've fucking loved it if something had!
Fucking right!
Go.
Go.
Go away!
Forgive me, Mom.
I know you'll be sad I'm gone.
But I know you'll be glad to know where I am.
Don't worry.
Your God is watching over me.
Raymond made me realize something the other day:
I've never told you I love you.
This side trip to the Holy Land, before Europe, would make her ecstatic.
Walking in Christ's footsteps certainly intrigued me... but I hadn't crossed the Atlantic out of Catholic faith.
Zac, are you there?
I love you, sweetheart!
God works in mysterious ways, my mother always said.
The good Lord brought you back.
It's a sign.
You'll heal him.
Thanks for coming, Christian.
I'm so happy you're staying.
I want to know everything.
Dad coming down?
He's in bed already.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I found him lying there, with a syringe in his arm.
I think it'll be a while before I get that 20 back.
What?
You lost that 20 long ago.
If you ask me, it was no accident.
He'll pull through.
He's tough.
I know I'm not a perfect father.
You certainly wouldn't have the problems you do otherwise.
Raymond, either.
I'm trying to understand what's happening to us now...
It's not easy.
I know I'm partly to blame.
I'd like to redeem myself, but I don't know how.
I don't know what to tell you... to make you understand you're not what you think.
You can't forsake life's greatest pleasure - having children.
There's nothing more beautiful... more powerful.
And that really hits home when you come close... to losing one.
Because... there's no greater pain.
The good Lord must surely be trying to tell me something.
If you think it's a lost cause... that you can't change...
I can't accept that.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Speaking.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Even in the face of death, we have faith that life goes on, for it comes from God.
It is to him that we now turn in prayer.
Our Father
Who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
They will be done On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day
Our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
You spoke well.
I was deeply... touched.
Ciao, bro.
See ya, kid.
Mr. Beaulieu...
You'll come visit us, hmm?
Bye, Dad.
Take care of yourself.
Mom, too.
I don't know if it was Raymond's passing, or if time heals all wounds, but my father had become my father once more.
Although it took him 10 years to allow me into his home with a lover.
And we've never mentioned our differences since.
Nor Patsy Cline.
Subtitling and translation:
CNST, Montreal
Who's there?
Hey, sneaky.
Nobody calls me that anymore.
I found you in the phone book.
Pia, what are you doing in DC?
Can we talk about it inside?
I need a place to stay for a while.
Look, I'm sorry, I-I can't.
I've worked too hard to get away.
I've changed, Jen.
I got out just like you did.
You were up late last night, huh?
Sir?
Yeah, I heard you laughing.
A friend of mine showed up last night.
We were talking about the old times.
She'll be staying for a while.
A new roommate?
It's just temporary, sir, until she finds her own place.
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, Coates.
Sir.
A roommate.
You won't have to feel guilty about her not being able to afford her rent anymore.
That thought never crossed my mind.
Commander, Colonel, you hear the one about the venture capitalist who buys an F-18 off the Internet and hires a Navy fighter jock to teach him how to fly it?
No, Bud.
What's the punch line?
Unfortunately, ma'am, there isn't one.
Sir, would it be possible for a civilian to buy an F-18 and actually get it to work?
Well, I know that, uh, museums have them.
You'd need spare parts.
I guess if you had enough cash, you could make it happen.
What Navy aviator would risk everything to teach a civilian to fly a fighter jet?
Would any amount of money be worth it?
Well, not to me, it wouldn't.
If you want a pilot's take on anything, Bud, my door is open.
Thank you, sir.
Bud, let me have a look at that.
Hey.
Is the general in yet?
Are you kidding, sir?
He beats the sun up.
He's in a meeting upstairs.
Everything okay between you two now?
He's kind of a tough one to figure out.
Like Chinese arithmetic, sir.
Look, Commander, I'd completely understand if you had misgivings about my friend Pia.
I don't even know her.
I know, sir, but considering where you found me, you'd have every reason not to trust anyone from my past.
All that matters is that you trust her.
I know all of that.
You gave me all the information the last time you tried to put me on hold.
I'm looking for Lieutenant Harriman's class- the afternoon session.
Mm-hmm.
Trying to get a spot in this anger management class over at Bethesda.
They don't make it easy.
Must be enough to make you mad.
Just kidding.
Hello?
Disconnected.
They must be busy.
Getting into those classes just in time, brother.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
Just... you're tense, stressed out.
That's because I have an anger management issue, Mike.
Look, if it were me and I was forced into anger management, it'd be enough to make me angry, too.
I have long since learned that anger serves no practical purpose in a situation like this.
Yeah, but you're only human.
Mike, the only reason I'm doing any of this is to make a show of good faith to my new CO- that's it.
I don't need these classes.
See, you're angry right now, aren't you?
Don't you have a train to catch?
Eventually.
Mike, I'm not angry.
I mean, I would know if I was angry, wouldn't I?
I don't know.
Would you?
Hello.
Commander Bud Roberts.
Tonight?
That would be great.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.
The class leader is gonna do my orientation interview tonight after work.
All right, well, good luck, Bud.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The door was open.
Um, I'm, I'm Pia
Bonfilio;
I'm Jen's friend.
Well, hi.
Harm.
I heard about you.
Welcome to the building.
So, you live here alone?
Yeah.
I guess it's pretty safe, huh?
I mean, Jen seems to feel okay living here.
Yeah, we haven't had any problems here.
Unless, of course, you count the assassin who used to live downstairs.
You're funny.
There's a low crime rate in the neighborhood, if that makes you feel any better.
Oh, you must think I'm paranoid, or something.
So... you're in the Navy, huh?
You must keep a gun around here somewhere.
I'm sorry.
I
- I can be so rude sometimes.
I'll see you around.
Okay.
You looking for something?
Uh, yeah.
My, um, hair clip.
You know, the one with the rhinestones on it.
Yeah, you mean this one?
I'm sorry.
I borrowed it.
I didn't think you'd mind.
That's okay.
Just ask, please, next time.
Do you like this?
I'd like to know where you got it.
The shop where I work.
The security tag is still on it.
Oh, yeah, I must have forgotten to take it off when I bought it.
You think I'm shoplifting?
You have to admit, it is what we used to do.
You don't do it anymore, and neither do I.
I haven't done that in a while.
Look, you have a right to be suspicious about me.
Listen, Pia, when I first met Commander Rabb, I didn't...
Harm?
Yeah, I just met him.
He's a really great guy.
Yeah, well, he's also my officer in charge.
Anyway, when I met him, he didn't have anyplace to put me, so he ended up taking me to a party, and a woman there accused me of stealing a bracelet.
I...
I don't want to treat you like some people have treated me.
You've always been there for me when I needed you.
So... here's my half of this month's rent.
Thank you.
Hey, Harriet.
Hey, it's me.
Are you there?
If you're there, pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Please be there.
Hello.
Okay, you're not there.
Listen, I'm on my way to Bethesda for that stupid anger management interview, and I got a flat.
I was hoping you could come and pick me up.
Okay.
Uh, give me a call when you get this.
I love you.
Bye.
Hello?
Lieutenant Harriman?
Hi, it's, uh, Commander Roberts.
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to be a little bit late.
No.
No, I know.
It's just that I got a flat tire, and...
No, I know that you've probably heard this a million times before, but I just...
What?
No, I'm not getting all worked up.
I'm just trying to tell you what's happening.
I... no, I...
Okay.
I will.
Bye.
You take a deep breath.
Thanks for cooking, Pia.
You have no idea how long it's been since I've eaten that well.
Why?
Don't they feed you in the Navy?
You're not doing the dishes after all of that.
What's up with the bruises, Pia?
Look, I told you I broke up with my boyfriend.
Yeah, well, that's some charm bracelet to remember him by.
Vince used to give me bruises like that.
He's not the boyfriend you're talking about?
Well, it's not like I stole him from you, Jen.
I mean, you were long gone before Vince and me hooked up.
Please don't smoke in here.
Sorry.
Pia, I'm giving you a chance here to tell me the truth.
He got a lot worse after you left.
He went to jail a couple times for stealing cars, and... when he got out of prison the last time, he was, um... he was angry all the time.
He got me to turn tricks for him, Jen.
Why didn't you just leave?
'Cause he said he was going to kill me.
Where is he now?
He's back in jail.
Outstanding warrants.
Look, it was my chance to leave, so I just grabbed what I could carry, and I left.
I want a second chance, Jen.
I want to start over like you did.
No more lies.
I know.
So, uh... are we okay?
I mean... can I stay?
For now.
Shoot!
Sometimes I can't do anything right.
I was late this morning, and the general is not happy.
Coates, if I didn't know better,
I would say that, uh, those are the telltale symptoms of a hangover.
That would be correct, ma'am.
My roommate made a big dinner last night, complete with wine.
She, uh, locked herself out, so I had to get a visitor's pass so she could come and get the key.
I won't make a habit of last night, ma'am.
That's a good idea.
Lieutenant Colonel MacKenzie, this is Pia.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
You changed your hair.
Oh, yeah, I
- I just braided it like the way you do yours.
Do you like it?
I only do mine like this 'cause I have to.
So you don't like it?
Well, it looks good on you.
So, what do you want for dinner tonight?
You don't have to cook every night.
Let's go out;
I know a great pizza place.
Well, we could...
we could order pizza in.
I feel like going out.
I don't want to go out, Jen.
Okay, fine.
I'll see you later.
Not a lot of hardware around here,
Lieutenant.
Most squadrons are deployed, Commander.
Nine days of being grounded.
I'm going nuts, sir.
Well, you are facing an orders violation, not to mention your failure to follow the NATOPS when you ran into trouble.
I'm not the first aviator to give a flying lesson to a civilian, Commander.
We're not talking about taking a friend up in a Cessna.
You back-seated for a civilian who bought an F-18 off the Internet.
You should've cleared it with your CO.
You're right.
Well, he's pretty embarrassed about the way things went down.
Oceana had to scramble a crew for your emergency landing.
You just should've ditched.
Why didn't you ditch?
Ditch, sir?
I had a dual fuel pump failure.
I wasn't going to try and talk an untrained civilian through a forced ejection.
Look, Air Ops can't believe that you were able to land her on such a short runway.
A dead-stick night landing?
We can make a good argument that an aviator of your talent should be in the air.
Thank you, sir.
But risking your life and your career like that?
I hope it was worth the money.
I didn't do it for the money.
Oh, let me guess, love?
Is this rich lunatic your boyfriend?
The "rich lunatic" is my father, Commander.
Answer that, would you?
Yeah.
COATES We're not here right now.
Leave a message for Jen or Mattie, and we'll call you back.
Jen, it's Carla.
Look, I can pick you up at your place tonight if you don't want to take the Metro.
Let me know; otherwise, I'll just see you there.
Press "erase" to erase all...
Who was on the phone?
Oh, just some, um...
some kind of survey thing.
Shoot.
I left a message for my friend asking for a ride.
I hate taking the subway at night.
Please take that off.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Um...
I just...
I
- I wanted to see how I looked in uniform.
There's an Army/Navy surplus store a few blocks away.
Practice being a sailor there.
I didn't mean that.
Look, Jen, I know you wouldn't say anything to hurt me.
You're-you're just... protective of your Navy life, and, I mean, it makes sense, because, you know, it seems like it's the best thing that ever happened to you.
Look... to be honest, this retail thing isn't really going anywhere, and so I was...
I was wondering if maybe you thought the Navy might let me join.
They let me in.
And look what it's done for you.
You smell something burning?
Your toaster was set on smolder, and I decimated a bagel in it earlier.
You weren't smoking, Pia?
I was smoking out the window!
Next time, take your whole body outside, okay?
Listen, I'm meeting with some enlisted friends for coffee tonight.
You should come along.
Give you a chance to ask them some questions about their experiences in the Navy.
Yeah, I, um, I think I'm just going to stay in tonight.
Look, Jen, I'm not going to be a shut-in here.
I'll get it together.
I'm just...
I'm not feeling very social right now.
Does that make sense?
And plus, you-you've got your own life.
I don't...
I don't want to get in the way.
You're not in the way.
I just want you to start having some fun.
I'm going to go get dressed.
Well, maybe we can do it another time.
Thanks for staying late to speak with me, Commander.
It's not a problem.
I want to get this matter resolved as soon as possible.
As do I, especially in light of Lieutenant Wall's exemplary record.
She's never had a discipline problem before.
Not even the hint of a black mark.
Yeah, and her fit-reps...
Outstanding, though she has been a bit distracted of late.
You think I'm being unreasonable, pressing for a court-martial for such a relatively minor orders violation, right?
Well, Commander, considering the Lieutenant's record, yes.
I think that a non-punitive letter and a hit to her fit-reps would be punishment enough.
Seems like a slap on the wrist to me.
Not only did she risk her own life and that of her passenger, but she risked the lives of the NAS Oceana ground crew when she had to make that emergency night landing.
Which she made look easy, and I think retaining an aviator of her skill trumps pillorying her as a poster-child for bad judgment.
Navy doesn't keep its runways open night and day so joyriders have a place to touch down.
No, Commander, that's true, but by the same token, Lieutenant Wall's landing at Oceana didn't require any extra personnel and didn't damage any Naval property.
Are you familiar with Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York?
We don't exchange Christmas cards, but yes.
Sorry, sir.
Giuliani had a very simple philosophy.
Where there was a broken window, you fix it.
Where there was graffiti, you clean it up.
On his watch, New York ran like a finely tuned Breitling.
I'm not sure I follow you, Commander.
The key to good order and discipline is sweating the small stuff.
Yes, Lieutenant Wall has committed a minor infraction, and that is why I'm going after her.
Well, I guess I'm glad my client didn't tag the CO's car or throw a baseball through a mess window.
Listen, if the lieutenant or you think that I'm going to look the other way because she happens to be one of the best pilots in this unit, you're sorely mistaken.
Now, I got to get back to my squadron, so you have yourself a good evening, Commander.
Just a minute.
Okay.
Hey, Jenny.
You don't write.
You don't call.
What's up?
I thought you were in prison.
Get the hell out of here, Vince.
Now, that's not the way you talk to an old friend, now, is it?
It is the way I talk to a son of a bitch
I never want to see again.
What do you want?
!
Not you.
I got over that a long time ago, okay?
Where's Pia, huh?
Now, I know she's here.
She kept tabs on you all these years.
Said she'd always be back, right?
I told you she's not here.
My neighbor's going to kick your ass if you don't get the hell out of here.
Oh, right, right.
Tell you what.
If your neighbor was home, he'd be here right now, but he's not, so you're by yourself.
Get it?
Well, well, well, what do we have here, hmm?
Where's Pia?
I told you she's not here.
Could you just go?
What is that?
God... how great it is to see you again.
You tell Pia I'll be waiting for her.
Okay?
Huh?
Okay?
You got it?
You can't just bust into my home and treat me like I'm some kind of loser!
That bastard!
What was in that envelope, Pia?
It was nothing.
Cut the crap!
What was in that envelope that was so important that he had to bust himself in here to get it?
!
It was everything, all right?
It was my driver's license and my ATM card and my credit card and all the cash
I had left.
Jen, I'm sorry that I hid in the closet, but I just...
I heard him screaming in the living room, and I got freaked out.
I know I should've said something, but...
I was so scared he was going to hurt me again.
Don't be scared, Pia.
Hey.
What happened to your door?
Pia lied to me, sir.
She, uh, hasn't been getting her life together.
She's been under her boyfriend's thumb back in Hagerstown this whole time.
He used to be my boyfriend.
He'd get me to work cons for him that he couldn't.
Nobody expects to be ripped off by a teenage girl.
After I left town, he replaced me with Pia.
He showed up last night looking for her.
Jen... you don't owe this girl safe harbor if it means putting yourself at risk.
It doesn't matter.
She was gone when I woke up.
She took one of my uniforms, sir.
Detectives Morris and Jimenez.
Are you Jennifer Coates?
Yes.
Do you know a Vince Dolan?
Yeah.
What's he wanted for this time?
Has Mr. Dolan been here recently?
Yeah, he was here last night.
Did the two of you argue?
Yes, we argued.
Look at the door.
Excuse me, but she's not answering any further questions until we know what this is about.
Sir, would you mind stepping outside until she changes?
And just who are you?
I'm her neighbor.
I'm also her attorney.
You were her attorney, Counselor.
Now you're wanted for questioning.
Mr. Dolan was murdered last night.
Found him in his car.
He had your name and address in his pocket.
Commander Roberts, when do I get my F-18 back?
It's impounded until I complete my investigation.
When a car's impounded you pay a fee, and you get it back.
Well, money's not gonna help you out of this one, sir.
That Stephanie's tenth birthday.
You take your hobbies pretty seriously, Mr. Wall.
Yeah, the dividends of success.
You know...
money's bought me many things, but it has also cost me my daughter.
When Stephanie was a kid,
I was always busy working to finance one venture after another, at the expense of the most important one of all.
That picture was taken six months before Stephanie's mother divorced me and took her downstate to live.
That must have been tough.
Yeah, I saw Stephanie weekends.
And even that stopped.
Birthday cards is about all we've exchanged in the last 15 years.
Oh, then you saw the F-18 on the Internet, and you saw an opportunity to use your mutual love of flying to reconnect.
Now, I assume that you had no idea of the impact it might have on her career?
Is that what Stephanie told you?
That I bought the plane as a bid for some sort of father-daughter reunion?
That's not what happened?
When I was dating Vince, he was stealing cars.
Since that time, he's graduated to cop killing.
Shot his way out of an ATF sting last week.
A federal officer died on the scene.
Ever see this?
I have one like that at home.
This one was found in Vince Dolan's car.
I wonder if I ask around if I'll find somebody who's seen you wearing it.
How'd you meet Jennifer Coates?
I was assigned to defend her in military court three years ago.
Because she committed a crime.
It was not a violent crime,
Detective.
She was a petty thief and a mixed-up kid.
She's worked hard to turn her life around.
Some people never really change, though, do they, Commander?
That's a pretty cynical way to look at things.
McGinty's Lounge, Anacostia area.
Vince wrote your address inside.
He wasn't after me.
A more recent ex of his was staying at my place.
Pia Bonfilio, also from Hagerstown.
Look her up.
Explain how a bar full of witnesses saw you fighting with Mr. Dolan last night?
They ID'd you from your military picture.
It wasn't me.
I was home last night.
I
- I never left.
Who can vouch for that?
No one, because the person who was supposed to be with me in my apartment was out killing Vince Dolan!
The witnesses were quite certain they saw you.
See, they don't get a lot of military in that bar.
Don't you get it?
It was my uniform on Pia.
Where were you last night, Commander?
Working, in my office.
Until what time?
I got home about midnight.
So you didn't hear the altercation between Jennifer Coates and Vince Dolan?
No, nor do I believe she is capable of killing anyone.
It's a bit unusual for a naval commander to have a petty officer living right down the hall from him, isn't it?
I mean, what is the nature of the relationship between you and Ms. Coates?
Professional and platonic.
You pay her rent.
Wow.
You guys are thorough.
I used to pay half of it.
It's a long story.
I got nothing but time.
Do you cook, Petty Officer?
What does that have to do with anything?
No real cook would have such cheap knives.
Same brand Detective Morris saw in your kitchen.
Not good for much, except apparently, sticking it into Vince Dolan.
One appeared to be missing from your set.
Am I gonna find your fingerprints on it?
If it's my knife, you'll probably find my prints.
That doesn't mean I used it to kill him.
I showed these tapes to Commander Rabb.
He says that Lieutenant Wall is as good a pilot as he's ever seen.
Fathers giving daughters driving lessons- that's one thing.
A daughter taking Dad out for a jaunt in his new fighter jet- that's new.
Well, her CO's a real hard-ass.
Wants to make an example out of her because she went behind his back.
He thinks he's Rudy Giuliani.
Sounds like mitigation is the key.
Well, I was onto something.
Her father- he's a real thrill-junkie.
They've been estranged for years, and what they share is this love of flying.
He buys the ultimate toy to woo her.
Wouldn't be the first absentee father to try to buy his child's affection.
Except there's one problem.
It wasn't his idea.
It was her idea.
Yeah, nothing's ever black and white between a father and a daughter.
I ought to know.
My dad died before I could make peace with him.
Two years later, I was...
I was finally ready, but it was too late.
You have a history with
Vince Dolan.
I'm hardly the only one.
Hagerstown PD remembers you.
1998.
Witnesses at a party saw you hit Vince Dolan over the head with a beer bottle.
I was dating Vince.
Earlier that day, he'd given me a black eye.
At the time, I felt that it was self-defense.
You could have killed him.
You threatened to.
I used to have a bad temper.
Did you ever meet Mr. Dolan?
No.
But Petty Officer Coates discussed him with you.
She said he'd come to her apartment looking for her friend.
Was she afraid?
I don't know.
Angry?
She was upset, okay?
I'll take that as a yes, Commander.
I'm not used to being treated like a criminal.
That's not entirely true, Jennifer, and we both know it.
Says in your file a judge suggested you enlist in the Navy.
I'm always suspicious of folks who go straight because the court compels them to.
All I can say is I didn't do it.
I told you, Pia Bonfilio...
We'll follow up on that lead, Petty Officer.
Right now we're talking about you.
Well, we shouldn't be.
Find Pia.
You'll see.
We look a lot alike.
She's been wearing this hair clip.
I caught her in my uniform, which is now missing from my apartment.
It had to have been her in that bar with Vince.
I haven't seen him in four years.
She was with him until just last week.
He came to my apartment looking for her.
He took a manila envelope out of her suitcase.
After that, he didn't seem very interested in finding Pia.
Vince got away with the plant money from the ATF sting.
Did you happen to see inside the envelope?
No, but if it was money, I don't suppose that Pia would be too happy if Vince walked off with it.
This is either the best or worst day of your life,
Petty Officer Coates.
The ME found a long brunette hair on Vince Dolan's body.
Now, this could either tie you conclusively to the murder of Vince Dolan, or it...
Don't even bother with a warrant.
Test the DNA from this.
You'll see I didn't do it.
Now, if you're not charging me, I'd like to go.
Don't leave town.
You won't get far if you try.
Just wish you'd spoken to me before you handed over your DNA.
I guess I wanted out of there so badly,
I would have done anything.
But the hair they found on Vince could be yours.
Listen, Jennifer, I spoke to Colonel MacKenzie.
You're gonna need a lawyer who's not likely to be called as a witness.
I got to get back to the office.
This is the key to my apartment.
You're welcome to hang out there if you don't feel safe in yours, all right?
Thank you, sir.
Don't worry about this.
We'll handle it.
Yes, we will.
Hey, was a woman here last night wearing a Navy uniform?
Oh, you're a laugh riot, miss.
You left that hanging out of your door this morning.
Management's not responsible for you getting robbed.
You lose this key, I gotta charge you two dollars.
I'm not gonna lose the damn key.
You and your boyfriend are two days behind on the rent.
How much?
37 bucks.
That's crap, and you know it.
$26.
No credit cards.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm just reading up on Mr. Wall.
He's run with the bulls in Pamplona.
He's ballooned around the world twice.
Oh, here's something interesting.
"Further delays in flight of space tourist. "
You and the Commander still have connections to the Russian military, don't you?
Well, Harm's brother resigned from the service, but I'm sure he still has friends in uniform.
Why?
We're not here right now.
Leave a message for Jen or Mattie, and we'll call you back.
Coates, where are you?
You're not at either apartment.
Look, I covered for you with the general, but you should have called him.
Call me as soon as you get this message.
Union Station, information desk.
May I help you?
Head in the clouds, Lieutenant?
Busted, sir.
Glad it's you.
If my CO caught me daydreaming,
I'd be facing a firing squad.
Not a bad idea.
You have a knack for being less than honest with people that are trying to help you.
I spoke with your father.
So he said.
He was afraid he might have made things worse by admitting that I was the one who approached him about the F-18.
He did.
And then I did a little digging.
Your father's last great
"millionaire adventure in flight,"
the trip to the International Space Station, experienced several delays, all "non-operational. "
So I had a colleague of mine contact the Russian military.
They say that he had been admitted to the hospital four times for seizures.
The look on your face tells me you know why.
Brain cancer.
It's inoperable.
I couldn't tell you because...
I didn't want my father to know that I know.
You mean he didn't tell you?
Like you said, Commander, omission runs in the family.
He called my mom to tell her about his will.
He didn't want me to know he was sick... didn't want me to feel obligated to make up with him.
I didn't want to say my good-byes at a funeral, sir, so when I saw the F-18 ad on the Internet...
Uh...
I spoke to your CO.
He says given this new information, he'll give you a non-punitive letter of caution only.
You'll be flying by week's end.
Sir, my dad checked into a hospital this morning.
Doctors say he won't be checking out.
I
- I-I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.
Hello?
Finally.
Where are you?
I've been calling you for hours.
I
- I-I'd rather not say, sir.
The 6:55 to Alexandria departing from Platform 7.
Jennifer, don't do anything stupid.
Look, sir, I know I've done some stupid things in the past, but trust me on this one.
You bitch!
How did you find me?
Vince was a creature of habit, Pia.
You weren't the first girl he took to the Saint Francis.
Shut up.
Now you're going to walk me to the train, Jen.
No sudden moves, I mean it.
What happened to you, Pia?
What do you care?
You got out.
Did you kill Vince over money?
After everything he did to both of us, is that what it came down to, to greed?
Greed is what he taught me, Jen.
I think he'd understand.
You got away with the money from the ATF sting, didn't you?
That's what he took when he came to my apartment.
I knew he'd still be drinking at the same old watering hole.
We fought.
I talked him into taking me to his car.
All I wanted was the $5,000.
You should have known he wouldn't give it to you.
That wouldn't be like him.
What do you know?
!
We had something.
Look, I didn't mean to kill him, all right?
He was hurting me.
So I just stuck a knife in him.
When he stopped breathing, it was like I was finally free.
You found the money in his room.
Yup, this time I win.
You haven't won anything, Pia.
I'm sorry you think so, Jen, but unfortunately it's time for you to go.
You're not going to shoot me in front of all these people.
You know, it was actually nice to see you again.
Over here!
Are you okay?
She has a gun!
Be careful!
Security to Red Line Platform.
You are not framing me, Pia.
Give me my money!
Jen!
Hey.
Don't worry.
They'll get her.
Petty Officer Coates believes the serial number on the money in that bag will match that from the ATF sting.
Now, that makes Pia part of Vince's gun scam and proves she had a motive for his murder.
Also, Saint Francis Hotel, room 24.
You'll find Pia's things and the coat she wore when she killed Vince.
It's my uniform coat.
We'll test it for Pia's hair, skin cells, and tie the coat conclusively to her.
Incidentally, Petty Officer Coates, the DNA from the hair on Vince Dolan's body didn't match yours.
You're free to go.
Thank you.
Sir, would it bother you if I looked for another place to live?
Of course not.
Don't ask me to help you move, though.
Thank you.
Thank you, Commander.
Where you headin', sweetheart?
San Francisco.
You going that far?
Climb in.
I can take you as far as Oakland.
And what's in San Francisco?
A friend of mine.
I'm hoping she can put me up for a while.
Wow, she's pretty flexible.
Just don't let her catch you looking at her, Probie.
I think she saw me.
She gave me that look.
What look?
The look she's always giving you.
Yep.
She saw you.
Hope you wore a cup.
Okay, welcome to my version of close combat training.
McGee.
Yeah?
You start with Kate.
Go on.
All right.
You and me the ring today.
You sure about that?
I've been taking classes.
In what?
Boxing.
We're grappling today.
You want to grapple?
Yeah.
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just, you know, I did some wrestling in high school.
Did you, now?
Hoo-hoo, come on.
Why I ought to...
Not bad, DiNozzo.
Thanks.
You learn how to box in the Marines?
No.
Corps doesn't teach boxing.
That's your loss.
They teach fighting.
Your phone.
Gibbs.
Have I mentioned that
I was hand picked to protect the President of the United States?
Five times.
You gonna take that abuse, McGee?
No!
That's more like it, McGee.
Why were you holding back?
Well, you're...
I mean, I've nevrestled...
A girl?
No.
Tony...
I look like a girl to you?
All I see are two
NCIS Special Agents.
Me, too.
Training's over.
We're heading to Quantico.
Guy tried to outrun a 500-pound bomb.
And...?
He lost.
Hey.
She had three older brothers growing up.
I think there's some unresolved issues there.
You think?
Break out the gear.I'm going to find out who's in charge of this circus.
You didn't have to stop like that.
I know that.
Sorry about that, Probie.
But it's your fault.
My fault?
Yeah, the brakes grab.
It's your job to see the vehicle's in perfect running condition.
You should've called.
I could've saved you guys a trip.
Why don't we start with, who the hell are you?
Gunnery Sergeant De Luca, CID.
Is this your idea of how to run a crime scene, Gunnery Sergeant?
Nope.
It's my idea of how to run an accidendeath investigation,
Special Agent...?
Gibbs.
Well, a civilian decided to trespass at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Marines didn't spot him till it was too late.
What was a civilian doing down there?
My guess, he was a scavenger.
Lot of metal and scrap iron's been dumped here over the years.
Enough to risk blowing yourself up over?
I didn't say he was smart, Agent Gibbs.
But, hey, you want NCIS to handle the paperwork on this one?
Fine.
Get down there, secure the scene.
Just make sure your people stay inside the marked areas cleared by EOD
I don't need another dead civilian on my hands.
Attractive.
I want everybody off this range except EOD personnel.
What about Mr. Potato Head?
He stays.With luck, he'll spit on my boots.
Looking for a reason to whack him in the head, Gibbs?
No.
To shoot him.
Tony, didn't you tell methat you worked a case on a live-impact range once?
Yeah, that's right.
Fort A.P. Hill.
Tragic.
What happened?
EOD missed ordnance marking the path.
Boom!
Agent walking point, a probie, of course, blew his foot off.
You're kidding, right?
Of course I'm kidding...
Probie.
We're right behind you, buddy.
You're doing great.
Some of them are buried under the ground.
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,
I'd say our young victim was running when he was hit.
How can you tell, doctor?
Oh, I've seen far too many of these types of wounds during my tour in Vietnam.
What about the bruising on his wrists and face, Duck?
It's possible it was caused by blast concussion.
We'll know more when we get him back.
This guy was no scavenger, boss.
Salvatore Ferragamo's.
What?
Italian shoes.
Expensive.
Pair I got cost almost 500 bucks.
Well, not everybody shops at Wal-Mart.
I'm not saying you shop at Wal-Mart.
Or even that that's a bad thing.
How's it going, Kate?
Almost finished.
I've got McGee doing measurements.
What are you doing?
Following our vict prints.
They came from over there.
Well, how'd he get down here?
We're at least five miles from the nearest civilian road.
Someone dropped him off.
Hey!
That area hasn't been cleared yet.
Agent Gibbs!
Hey!
You trying to get yourself killed?
Are you deaf or nuts?
Little of both.
You still think that this was an accident, Gunny?
Jimmy, run this up to Abby for me.
Uh, sure.
Would it be okay if I stayed and chatted with her for awhile, doctor?
We're rather busy at the moment.
Okay, so you're saying that, uh... it's not okay, then?
Sorry.
Sorry.
The accent kind of throws me off sometimes.
He means well,but often ve an overwhelming urge to slap him.
Is that wrong?
Do it all the time.
So I've noticed.
But only on the back of the head.
A slap in the face would be humiliating.
Back of the head's a wake up call.
Looks like he got both.
You were right.
His facial injuries weren't from the bombs.
Our victim received a rather savage beating before his death.
And our crispy critter?
He wasn't burned by today's explosions.
Tests indicate the poor chap's been deceased east six months.
There are more bodies out there.
Yes.
I was afraid of that.
We've stumbled into a bone yard, Duck.
Yeah.
Serial killer's dumping ground.
Hey, Gunny!
What have we got here?
Well, that's not good.
hear that?
Yeah, what is that?
Evac!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Let's
Weat leastet gGithng

Just remember, they torture because care.
So Ie them slike me....
It'lt wors 's what I thought.

And he's cute.
He's dead.
I know.
's also a macriminal
What I say, I'm attracted to the bad boy...
No way.
I'm get hacked.
A port sca
No, no, this is major.
ey've already burned thr the NCIS firewall.
Well, isolate e node and dump thn the other side of the router.
I'm trying!
It's moving too fast
Ohis is good.
They're using our connection with AFIS database-- sever it.
I can't, It's a point attack.
He or she is only going after my machine.
It's not possible, there's DOD Level Nine encryption.
It would take months...
Hey.
What is that,a video game?
No, Tony, we're getting hacked.
If they get into Abby's computer, the entire NCIS network is next.
I can't stop him.
Do something, McGee.
I've never seen code like this.
Ah, way to go, Abby.
I didn't do anything.
I thought you did?
No.
I did.
What the hell's going on here?
We were pulling a fingerprint match from the AFIS database and we set off some kind of cyber attack.
- They were definitely waiting for us.
- Who?
I don't know, Tony, and right now
I'm afraid to turn my machine back on.
The speed they were cracking our encryption at there's only a few computers in the world with that type of power.
Name them.
Well, the...the CERN institute in Geneva IBM's research facility, rumors of a few in China.
Oh, good, so it should be easy to find them.
China.
You want some?
Thanks.
Whoever this guy is, he's got some friends in high places, Gibbs.
Victor Gera.
AKA Guido Valentino.
Career criminal.
Guido Valentino?
That's the alias he used in L.A.
Started running numbers in Chicago as a kid, moved onto jacking cars as a teen, graduated to drug dealing on the West Coast.
Six months ago,he showed up in D.C.
Mafia?
Well, with names like Vic Gera and Guido Valentino, what else?
Probie, in case you forget,my name is
Tony DiNozzo.
Italiano.
Doesn't make me, Mafia, now does it?
I'm sorry.
Prego.
McGee, what's the connection between small-time hood and super computer?
Well, I have no idea, boss.
Ooh, wrong answer.
I'll go look for the right one now.
Why would the mob, or anyone, stash bodies at a Marine bombing range?
Because it's the last place you'd look for them.
Who'd be nuts enough to go down there looking for bodies?
Besides us?
Yeah, Gibbs.
You did what?
!
I'm on my way!
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.
He's not done screwing up my investigation.
Wow.
I thought you were the only one who could piss him off like that.
You never met his second wife.
I told you not to touch anything without my M.E. being present.
I didn't really have much of a choice.
It was near an unstable javelin round.
It'd likely kill me and another Marine when it exploded.Here.
You have a body that goes with this?
I think it was destroyed during the explosion.
You think?
Look, EOD kicked me off the range.
That whole entire area's been declared off limits 'til it's cleared.
How long?
Gibbs, there's decades of unexploded ordnance down there.
My guess, three weeks, minimum.
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.
Gunny, you coming?
I set up a virtual model emulating my system.
He comes back again, we can dump him into it.
Won't fool him for long.
All I need is a minute to back-trace his connection.
Okay, I'm ready.
Plug me in, McGee.
Round two.
He's still there and coming on strong.
Initiating my back-trace... now.
Oh, this guy is good.
He's almost made it through your little virtual world.
Yeah, but I'm better.
Oh, got you!
Ha!
Now let's see who we're dealing with.
Oh, my God.
Gibbs is going to kill you.
Kill me?
Why?
I'm not gonna tell him.
EOD has cleared 10% of the range so far.
In this small area and in a relatively short span of time, we found three bodies.
Do the math and we could be looking at potentially 30 or more victims concealed down there.
Gunny, I want you to coordinate with the Provost Martial.
I want a cordon around that range 24 hours a day.
Agent Gibbs, that's a lot of man power.
You really think...
Well, then you'd better get moving.
Right.
Is there some secret to getting on his good side?
Oh, there's no secret.
He doesn't have one.
Uh, excuse me, boss?
What?
We completed the back-trace on the intruder's system.
Yeah?
Yeah, and, uh...
Well, the thing is...
The hacker...
It's me.
Why is NCIS interested in Vic Gera, Gibbs?
Who said we were interested in him?
You ran his prints through AFIS.
Where'd you get them?
He gave them to us.
You have him in custody?
Technically speaking.
Where'd you find him?
On a live fire range at Quantico.
He was killed in a practice bomb drop this morning.
He Mafia?
He's an undercover FBI Agent, DiNozzo.
When we saw your print search, we were hoping Vic was alive.
I want his killer, Gibbs.
Is that an offer for a joint investigation?
I can't.
Kate, Tony, escort our guests out.
I need to talk to you alone.
Our usual conference room.
What's going on?
Fornell seems unusually upset.
For an FBI Agent.
How would you feel if one of your team was lying on a slab?
Depends on who it was.
You always a smart ass?
Just to you boys from the Hoover building.
I'm listening.
Jimmy Napalitano.
Know him?
Fat, ugly Mafioso, runs the business in Maryland, Virginia and D.C.
I've spent half my career trying to put that bastard behind bars.
Three trials, three times he walked on a technicality.
Tough to be sympathetic, considering you let Ari go.
Ari's a valuable intelligence asset, Gibbs.
Napalitano's nothing but a cheap hood.
Ari shot one of my people, kidnapped one of my agents, put a round through me.
I don't see the difference, Fornell.
I knew this was a waste of time.
At least we agree on something.
Anyone ever tell you you're an insufferable bastard?
Yeah.
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here because I need your help.
I offered a joint investigation.
You turned it down.
I couldn't say anything in front of those Agents.
You don't trust them?
Napalitano's always been a step ahead of me.
Every informant, every agent I get close to him ends up like that kid downstairs.
No one's that lucky.
He's got a mole in the Bureau.
Or someone with access to my operations.
Why not take it to Internal Affairs?
They can't help me.
But I can?
Realizing how sad this sounds, you're the closest thing I have to a friend, Gibbs.
You dying or something?
Okay, not dying.
This some part of a 12-step program?
Look, you going to help me or not?
I'm thinking about it.
It's settled then.
This isn't your style, Tobias.
I know it.
The Bureau believes that the mole who put my man on your slab.... is me.
Sorry, Tobias.
Hey, Tiffany, enough with the smoking already.
Get off my back, Ricky.
I pay you to dance, not get lung cancer.
All right, already.
I thought Tiffany was your numero uno?
Nah, I dumped her.
Rickey, how do ya dump somethin' that looks like that?
It's easy.
Ba-da bing, ba-da boom.
Ciao!
I gotta remember that one.
The comedian is Napalitano's son, Little Rickey.
Who's the muscle with him?
Sal Balducci, Napalitano's enforcer.
And that's the man himself.
Jimmy Napalitano, AKA Jimmy Naps.
He's politically connected and has the finest lawyers money can buy.
He's virtually untouchable.
We got a problem.
What kind of problem, Pops?
Not here.
Inside.
You got ears inside?
No.
Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.
Camera two, get me tight on the thug by the rear entrance.
_They find our bugs and wiretaps before we finish installing them.
-Or your mole tips 'em off.
There's no mole.
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.
They study us like we study them.
Rumor has it they have dossiers on all of us.
They even know we're watching them right now.
Camera one, show me Abe.
Hello, Abe.
"Abe?"
As in Vigoda.
That's the FBI call sign for him.
Oh, yeah, it does sort of look like him.
Tom, can you get me off, for old time's sake?
Sorry, Solly.
No can do.
You two through?
Sorry.
Point is, Agent Gibbs, it's impossible to get near them.
Agent Gera did.
And he's dead.
Not much of a view.
Kind of reminds me of your basement.
It'sot dark enough.
You see the Bureau's case against me?
You know that your people won't share files with us.
What's this supposed to be?
Coffee.
I'll take your word for it.
They found two kilos of coke and 50 grand in counterfeit bills in my freezer.
I thought the coke in ice cream quarts was a nice touch.
It was an expensive one.
Jimmy Naps's going to a lot of trouble to frame youTobias...
Why now?
He knew I was vulnerable.
Vulnerable?
How?
Ari.
You laying this on me, huh?
I arranged your meeting with him, Jethro.
He's our only agent inside Al Qaeda, and what did you do?
You shot him.
I could have killed him.
Putting a round in his shoulder helped sell his cover to Al Qaeda.
Why don't you explain that to the director?
He didn't buy it when I did.
Okay.
If you think it'll do any good.
I'm not getting out of this, am I?
Ah, you'll get out of it.
It just may not be the way you like.
Duck, what do you got for me?
Ah, I've identified our second victim from the dental charts supplied by the FBI.
His name's Frank Pilato.
Frankie P.
He was to testify against Napalitano five years ago.
Disappeared walking his dog on a Sunday afternoon.
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon strolls can be dangerous.
Ducky, I thought you said the test indicated he was dead only five or six months ago.
I did.
Anyone care to guess how he died?
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say something to do with flames?
And you'd be wrong, Tony.
His throat was slit.
Bled to death.
Actually, no, Kate.
Lead poisoning.
Three nine-millimeter slugs to be exact.
Administered at close range.
He was kidnapped in '99.
And wasn't shot until a few months ago?
He was most likely executed years ago;
His body has only recently been exposed to the elements.
Excuse me.
His blood was drained after death... and his body frozen.
Jimmy Naps' version of the ice man.
They stashed the body in a cooler somewhere and then dump it years later when everyone's stopped looking.
Yeesh.
Shot, throat slit, frozen and burned?
Jimmy Naps definitely didn't like this dude.
The Mafia does tend to have a flair for the dramatic, Tony.
Anything on the finger parts Gunny De Luca picked up on the range?
I'm good, Jethro, but not that good.
I sent them up to Abby.
Kate, Tony.
On it, boss.
Agent Charles, can you get me the Bureau file on Fornell?
I haven't even seen it.
I get caught, I'm finished as a Federal Agent.
Don't get caught.
You know what I think, McGee?
What?
I think you're more interested in me than what I'm doing.
That's not true.
Wait, not that I-I'm not interested...
in you.
I am.
But I'm more interested in the work.
How could you say that?
Because what I'm looking at through the microscope...
Yeah?
...is up there on that screen.
Hey, guys!
You here for the finger or the blood?
What blood?
I found two types on Agent Gera's face.
One is his.
One is not.
So if he was beaten, you know, kind of like the way you were yesterday by Gibbs, it could be the killer's.
Kate, Kate, Kate, when I let Gibbs win, we all win.
And if I beat the crap out of him, who do you think he's going to take it out on?
Oh, that's right, all of us.
So you took a dive for the team?
Of course, McGee.
It's good to know.
It sure is.
Turn around.
I'm waiting for you to slap the back of my head, boss.
I'm not going to slap your head.
You're not?
What, you don't think I have a sense of humor?
Abbs, I need the DNA on the unknown blood.
I already started it.
Okay, what about the finger?
Any idea how long it was it on the range?
Well, ordinarily, you can't date bone unless it's been in the ground long enough to soak up fluorine.
Which is, like, hundreds of years.
But sometimes being in a place where things get blown up is a good thing.
I swabbed the finger for explosives and I found traces of one:
mercury fulminate,which was completely phased out by the military by 1986.
Well, that means the Mafia must have been dumping bodies down there for...
At least 18 years.
Thank you, McGee.
That's a good job, Abbs.
McGee, find a way to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Okay.
It's no fun if you know it's coming.
What was that for?
!
That's for eating my sandwich.
I know how to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Gonna sleep with him?
He was hit with two paternity suits in the last five years.
Beat them both with a DNA test.
Nice try, Probie, but those tests are sealed court records.
Those court records are sealed, McGee.
Hey, that's what I just said-- first!
But not the records from the lab that he used.
It's downtown.
You'll never get a judge to sign off on that warrant.
Maybe we don't need one.
That is, if you're ready to become a father.
I think she's talking to you, Probie.
We go down to the lab and see if I'm carrying your baby.
It'll be fun.
Oh, and we can steal Little Rickey's DNA test.
Photograph it for Abby.
I'll do it.
Why you?
You think anyone'd believe you actually slept with Kate?
Hey!
I figured out how to get Little Rickey's DNA records.
You mean I fig...
Hey, there is no 'I'in "team," McGee.
How?
Paternity clinic downtown.
Kate and I can have them in an hour.
Go get 'em.
Thank you, sir.
McGee.
I got the file on Fornell.
Good.
Not good.
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps was under surveillance.
He can explain this.
That photo came from an anonymous source.
From the newspaper blowup you can see the date.
The 17th?
Tobias had me pull surveillance on the 17th.
Why?
Never said.
But it's the day before Agent Gera disappeared.
He didn't hang himself, not Fornell.
That's the coward's way out and Tobias was no coward.
Only one person was in this cell with him today.
Who?
Me.
To cut him down.
Doctor...
I would like our M.E.,
Dr. Mallard, to receive a copy of your autopsy report.
Ducky?
Of course.
You writing my name right?
What?
!
I just want to know if it's mine.
She kind of sleeps around a lot, if you know what I mean.
If I did, it's 'cause he ain't any good in bed.
Least I didn't sleep with my cousin.
You slept with my sister.
I thought it was you.
She weighs 300 pounds.
She was wearing your earrings.
Now that's enough.
If you two can't be civil I'm going to have to ask you leave.
Look, is there anywhere that I can wait away from him, please?
I'm begging you.
There's an empty exam room behind you two doors on the right.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
She slept with my brother... and my best friend at the same time.
Okay, we've got Rickey's DNA from the clinic.
Let's see if we can match it to our sample from the crime scene.
We're cued up.
Initiating DNA match.
That's it, it's Rickey Napalitano's blood.
Thanks, Abs.
We made a good couple, Kate.
For The Jerry Springer Show.
Dig your threads.
You got to be kidding me?
Un-freaking-believable, he whacked himself.
Yeah, poor Fornell.
You won't see him no more, Pops.
What the...?
This guy's pulling us over, boss.
If I find out we got a busted taillight or something, Sallie boy, it's your ass.
Is there a problem, officer?
You're talking to the wrong person.
Buona sera.
We got a warrant for your arrest, Little Dickey.
It's Rickey.
It's for murder, Dickey.
Come on.
Get out.
All right.
Hands on the hood, big guy.
Hand up.
Who the hell are you guys anyway, FBI?
NCIS.
Meat inspectors?
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?
They're Navy cops.
Turn around.
Arrested by Navy cops?
Talk about embarrassing.
At least you're hot, sweet...
Take it easy, take it easy.
Now that's embarrassing.
Let's go.
All right, don't worry.
Go with them, Rickey.
Our lawyers'll take care of this.
I don't think we've met, Agent...
Special Agent.
Gibbs.
Special Agent Gibbs.
So who is it my son was supposed to have whacked?
An FBI Agent.
Victor Gera.
I remember something about that.
Something happened on a marinease?
What was that?
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.
A bomb.
Yeah, yeah.
Suppose-
- God forbid-- that my son could be connected to this accident, what would you charge him with,
Special Agent Gibbs?
Manslaughter.
Manslaughter?
Manslaughter, what's the worst you can get with that, Sallie?
Four years.
Does one.
Might do the kid some good, season him up a bit.
Jail can be a dangerous place.
So they tell me.
You remind me of somebody, Special Agent Gibbs.
Who was that guy that always talking trash, that Fed?
Fornell?
Oh, yeah, Fornell.
That's it, yeah.
Whatever happened to him?
I think he hung himself.
Real sad.
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.
All that ambition and everything and he ends up doing the twist.
I get the government agent on your payroll by sunup, dirt bag... or Little Rickey does the twist.
Say I do this, all right?
What do I get?
I deliver Little Rickey to you, the evidence against him gets lost, and you never see me again.
You'd do all this just to clear Fornell's name?
He was my friend.
You can't threaten to kill someone in custody, Gibbs.
It wasn't a threat.
You'd really do it?
Hey.
You want to clear Tobias's name?
Hell, yes.
But not by letting Little Rickey off for Vic's murder.
Oh, he'll screw up again.
You think Jimmy Naps is going to make a swap and just let you walk away?
I hope not.
Gibbs.
Rear of the club.
One hour.
Lose the Feds in the building and in the alley.
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm operating on my own hook.
Pick another place.
You want me to pick a place?
I'm trying to show you there are no tricks here, Jimmy boy.
Coleman Park.
You know it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it.
Come alone.
I'm not that stupid.
All right, we each bring a man.
One hour.
And, Gibbs... you hurt my boy,
I'll kill your brothers, your uncles, your father...
and after their funerals, I'll kill you.
No brothers, no uncles.
My father passed years ago.
I do have three ex-wives whose names and addresses
I will gladly fax on to you.
Oh.
He hung up.
Whoa.
Where do you three think you're going?
With you, boss.
I can bring one back up.
Clearly you should take me.
Kate, with all due respect...
Are you kidding, Tony, why should he bring you?
With all due respect, you have no idea...
You're a total jackass.
Come on, you can conduct yourself in the field?
Agent Charles is going.
Me?
Are you kidding, boss?
He's kidding, right?
I don't think he is, Tony.
Gibbs, you need someone...
Someone who can verify the guy that Jimmy Naps turns over is FBI or Justice.
Can any of you do that?
He's right.
I know the players.
I go.
These bracelets are killing me.
You hear me?
Stay there, Sallie.
Stay, stay.
Where's my boy?
Where's Rickey?
Pops.
Hey.
You okay, son?
No.
Make them take these freaking bracelets off me.
Where's your end of the swap?
I leave my backup at the car, u do the same.
Sallie, bring him out.
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.Chop-chop, let's go.
We ain't got all day.
That's Abe.
Stupido.
Pop, I had nothing to do...
Not you, not you.This jabone.
What'd you think I was gonna do, let you come in my backyard and walk away with your coglioni?
You know what Primacord is, Jimmy?
Primacord?
That was Primacord.
This... is Primacord.
Oh!
Oh!
Pops!
And this is a dead-man's switch.
Oh, marone.
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.
All you have to do is give me your mole's name.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
You dumb Wop.
He never would've set it off.
The blast would kill him.
Who you gonna believe?
He's pazzo, Pop.
He'll do it.
He'll do it.
In fact, I think the blast should kill all of you.
You should've kept your mouth shut, Napalitano.
You lied to me, Jimmy.
Like you didn't expect it.
I just saved all our lives.
Now what?
Ciao.
Pops.
Pops!
You go to jail, you stay there a couple of years, it'll do you good, son.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, let's go.
Get this thing off me.
Here.
Do it yourself.
Boom.
What you doing there, Probie?
I'm trying to find what I missed.
How did Gibbs know that it was Charles?
You mean you didn't know?
He didn't know.
What, you knew?
We're seasoned investigators, McGee.
You have to start thinking outside the box.
Expect the unexpected.
Good advice, Tony.
Agent Todd.
DiNozzo.
McGee.
What?
Wow, she's pretty flexible.
Just don't let her catch you looking at her, Probie.
I think she saw me.
She gave me that look.
What look?
The look she's always giving you.
Yep.
She saw you.
Hope you wore a cup.
Okay, welcome to my version of close combat training.
McGee.
Yeah?
You start with Kate.
Go on.
All right.
You and me the ring today.
You sure about that?
I've been taking classes.
In what?
Boxing.
We're grappling today.
You want to grapple?
Yeah.
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just, you know, I did some wrestling in high school.
Did you, now?
Hoo-hoo, come on.
Why I ought to...
Not bad, DiNozzo.
Thanks.
You learn how to box in the Marines?
No.
Corps doesn't teach boxing.
That's your loss.
They teach fighting.
Your phone.
Gibbs.
Have I mentioned that
I was hand picked to protect the President of the United States?
Five times.
You gonna take that abuse, McGee?
No!
That's more like it, McGee.
Why were you holding back?
Well, you're...
I mean, I've nevrestled...
A girl?
No.
Tony...
I look like a girl to you?
All I see are two
NCIS Special Agents.
Me, too.
Training's over.
We're heading to Quantico.
Guy tried to outrun a 500-pound bomb.
And...?
He lost.
Hey.
She had three older brothers growing up.
I think there's some unresolved issues there.
You think?
Break out the gear.I'm going to find out who's in charge of this circus.
You didn't have to stop like that.
I know that.
Sorry about that, Probie.
But it's your fault.
My fault?
Yeah, the brakes grab.
It's your job to see the vehicle's in perfect running condition.
You should've called.
I could've saved you guys a trip.
Why don't we start with, who the hell are you?
Gunnery Sergeant De Luca, CID.
Is this your idea of how to run a crime scene, Gunnery Sergeant?
Nope.
It's my idea of how to run an accidendeath investigation,
Special Agent...?
Gibbs.
Well, a civilian decided to trespass at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Marines didn't spot him till it was too late.
What was a civilian doing down there?
My guess, he was a scavenger.
Lot of metal and scrap iron's been dumped here over the years.
Enough to risk blowing yourself up over?
I didn't say he was smart, Agent Gibbs.
But, hey, you want NCIS to handle the paperwork on this one?
Fine.
Get down there, secure the scene.
Just make sure your people stay inside the marked areas cleared by EOD
I don't need another dead civilian on my hands.
Attractive.
I want everybody off this range except EOD personnel.
What about Mr. Potato Head?
He stays.With luck, he'll spit on my boots.
Looking for a reason to whack him in the head, Gibbs?
No.
To shoot him.
Tony, didn't you tell methat you worked a case on a live-impact range once?
Yeah, that's right.
Fort A.P. Hill.
Tragic.
What happened?
EOD missed ordnance marking the path.
Boom!
Agent walking point, a probie, of course, blew his foot off.
You're kidding, right?
Of course I'm kidding...
Probie.
We're right behind you, buddy.
You're doing great.
Some of them are buried under the ground.
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,
I'd say our young victim was running when he was hit.
How can you tell, doctor?
Oh, I've seen far too many of these types of wounds during my tour in Vietnam.
What about the bruising on his wrists and face, Duck?
It's possible it was caused by blast concussion.
We'll know more when we get him back.
This guy was no scavenger, boss.
Salvatore Ferragamo's.
What?
Italian shoes.
Expensive.
Pair I got cost almost 500 bucks.
Well, not everybody shops at Wal-Mart.
I'm not saying you shop at Wal-Mart.
Or even that that's a bad thing.
How's it going, Kate?
Almost finished.
I've got McGee doing measurements.
What are you doing?
Following our vict prints.
They came from over there.
Well, how'd he get down here?
We're at least five miles from the nearest civilian road.
Someone dropped him off.
Hey!
That area hasn't been cleared yet.
Agent Gibbs!
Hey!
You trying to get yourself killed?
Are you deaf or nuts?
Little of both.
You still think that this was an accident, Gunny?
Jimmy, run this up to Abby for me.
Uh, sure.
Would it be okay if I stayed and chatted with her for awhile, doctor?
We're rather busy at the moment.
Okay, so you're saying that, uh... it's not okay, then?
Sorry.
Sorry.
The accent kind of throws me off sometimes.
He means well,but often ve an overwhelming urge to slap him.
Is that wrong?
Do it all the time.
So I've noticed.
But only on the back of the head.
A slap in the face would be humiliating.
Back of the head's a wake up call.
Looks like he got both.
You were right.
His facial injuries weren't from the bombs.
Our victim received a rather savage beating before his death.
And our crispy critter?
He wasn't burned by today's explosions.
Tests indicate the poor chap's been deceased east six months.
There are more bodies out there.
Yes.
I was afraid of that.
We've stumbled into a bone yard, Duck.
Yeah.
Serial killer's dumping ground.
Hey, Gunny!
What have we got here?
Well, that's not good.
hear that?
Yeah, what is that?
Evac!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Let's
Weat leastet gGithng
I heare kicked your buhis McGee.
Weheard wrong.

Just remember, they torture because care.
So Ie them slike me....
It'lt wors 's what I thought.

And he's cute.
He's dead.
I know.
's also a macriminal
What I say, I'm attracted to the bad boy...
No way.
I'm get hacked.
A port sca
No, no, this is major.
ey've already burned thr the NCIS firewall.
Well, isolate e node and dump thn the other side of the router.
I'm trying!
It's moving too fast
Ohis is good.
They're using our connection with AFIS database-- sever it.
I can't, It's a point attack.
He or she is only going after my machine.
It's not possible, there's DOD Level Nine encryption.
It would take months...
Hey.
What is that,a video game?
No, Tony, we're getting hacked.
If they get into Abby's computer, the entire NCIS network is next.
I can't stop him.
Do something, McGee.
I've never seen code like this.
Ah, way to go, Abby.
I didn't do anything.
I thought you did?
No.
I did.
What the hell's going on here?
We were pulling a fingerprint match from the AFIS database and we set off some kind of cyber attack.
- They were definitely waiting for us.
- Who?
I don't know, Tony, and right now
I'm afraid to turn my machine back on.
The speed they were cracking our encryption at there's only a few computers in the world with that type of power.
Name them.
Well, the...the CERN institute in Geneva IBM's research facility, rumors of a few in China.
Oh, good, so it should be easy to find them.
China.
You want some?
Thanks.
Whoever this guy is, he's got some friends in high places, Gibbs.
Victor Gera.
AKA Guido Valentino.
Career criminal.
Guido Valentino?
That's the alias he used in L.A.
Started running numbers in Chicago as a kid, moved onto jacking cars as a teen, graduated to drug dealing on the West Coast.
Six months ago,he showed up in D.C.
Mafia?
Well, with names like Vic Gera and Guido Valentino, what else?
Probie, in case you forget,my name is
Tony DiNozzo.
Italiano.
Doesn't make me, Mafia, now does it?
I'm sorry.
Prego.
McGee, what's the connection between small-time hood and super computer?
Well, I have no idea, boss.
Ooh, wrong answer.
I'll go look for the right one now.
Why would the mob, or anyone, stash bodies at a Marine bombing range?
Because it's the last place you'd look for them.
Who'd be nuts enough to go down there looking for bodies?
Besides us?
Yeah, Gibbs.
You did what?
!
I'm on my way!
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.
He's not done screwing up my investigation.
Wow.
I thought you were the only one who could piss him off like that.
You never met his second wife.
I told you not to touch anything without my M.E. being present.
I didn't really have much of a choice.
It was near an unstable javelin round.
It'd likely kill me and another Marine when it exploded.Here.
You have a body that goes with this?
I think it was destroyed during the explosion.
You think?
Look, EOD kicked me off the range.
That whole entire area's been declared off limits 'til it's cleared.
How long?
Gibbs, there's decades of unexploded ordnance down there.
My guess, three weeks, minimum.
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.
Gunny, you coming?
I set up a virtual model emulating my system.
He comes back again, we can dump him into it.
Won't fool him for long.
All I need is a minute to back-trace his connection.
Okay, I'm ready.
Plug me in, McGee.
Round two.
He's still there and coming on strong.
Initiating my back-trace... now.
Oh, this guy is good.
He's almost made it through your little virtual world.
Yeah, but I'm better.
Oh, got you!
Ha!
Now let's see who we're dealing with.
Oh, my God.
Gibbs is going to kill you.
Kill me?
Why?
I'm not gonna tell him.
EOD has cleared 10% of the range so far.
In this small area and in a relatively short span of time, we found three bodies.
Do the math and we could be looking at potentially 30 or more victims concealed down there.
Gunny, I want you to coordinate with the Provost Martial.
I want a cordon around that range 24 hours a day.
Agent Gibbs, that's a lot of man power.
You really think...
Well, then you'd better get moving.
Right.
Is there some secret to getting on his good side?
Oh, there's no secret.
He doesn't have one.
Uh, excuse me, boss?
What?
We completed the back-trace on the intruder's system.
Yeah?
Yeah, and, uh...
Well, the thing is...
The hacker...
It's me.
Why is NCIS interested in Vic Gera, Gibbs?
Who said we were interested in him?
You ran his prints through AFIS.
Where'd you get them?
He gave them to us.
You have him in custody?
Technically speaking.
Where'd you find him?
On a live fire range at Quantico.
He was killed in a practice bomb drop this morning.
He Mafia?
He's an undercover FBI Agent, DiNozzo.
When we saw your print search, we were hoping Vic was alive.
I want his killer, Gibbs.
Is that an offer for a joint investigation?
I can't.
Kate, Tony, escort our guests out.
I need to talk to you alone.
Our usual conference room.
What's going on?
Fornell seems unusually upset.
For an FBI Agent.
How would you feel if one of your team was lying on a slab?
Depends on who it was.
You always a smart ass?
Just to you boys from the Hoover building.
I'm listening.
Jimmy Napalitano.
Know him?
Fat, ugly Mafioso, runs the business in Maryland, Virginia and D.C.
I've spent half my career trying to put that bastard behind bars.
Three trials, three times he walked on a technicality.
Tough to be sympathetic, considering you let Ari go.
Ari's a valuable intelligence asset, Gibbs.
Napalitano's nothing but a cheap hood.
Ari shot one of my people, kidnapped one of my agents, put a round through me.
I don't see the difference, Fornell.
I knew this was a waste of time.
At least we agree on something.
Anyone ever tell you you're an insufferable bastard?
Yeah.
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here because I need your help.
I offered a joint investigation.
You turned it down.
I couldn't say anything in front of those Agents.
You don't trust them?
Napalitano's always been a step ahead of me.
Every informant, every agent I get close to him ends up like that kid downstairs.
No one's that lucky.
He's got a mole in the Bureau.
Or someone with access to my operations.
Why not take it to Internal Affairs?
They can't help me.
But I can?
Realizing how sad this sounds, you're the closest thing I have to a friend, Gibbs.
You dying or something?
Okay, not dying.
This some part of a 12-step program?
Look, you going to help me or not?
I'm thinking about it.
It's settled then.
This isn't your style, Tobias.
I know it.
The Bureau believes that the mole who put my man on your slab.... is me.
Sorry, Tobias.
Hey, Tiffany, enough with the smoking already.
Get off my back, Ricky.
I pay you to dance, not get lung cancer.
All right, already.
I thought Tiffany was your numero uno?
Nah, I dumped her.
Rickey, how do ya dump somethin' that looks like that?
It's easy.
Ba-da bing, ba-da boom.
Ciao!
I gotta remember that one.
The comedian is Napalitano's son, Little Rickey.
Who's the muscle with him?
Sal Balducci, Napalitano's enforcer.
And that's the man himself.
Jimmy Napalitano, AKA Jimmy Naps.
He's politically connected and has the finest lawyers money can buy.
He's virtually untouchable.
We got a problem.
What kind of problem, Pops?
Not here.
Inside.
You got ears inside?
No.
Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.
Camera two, get me tight on the thug by the rear entrance.
-They find our bugs and wiretaps before we finish installing them.
-Or your mole tips 'em off.
There's no mole.
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.
They study us like we study them.
Rumor has it they have dossiers on all of us.
They even know we're watching them right now.
Camera one, show me Abe.
Hello, Abe.
"Abe?"
As in Vigoda.
That's the FBI call sign for him.
Oh, yeah, it does sort of look like him.
Tom, can you get me off, for old time's sake?
Sorry, Solly.
No can do.
You two through?
Sorry.
Point is, Agent Gibbs, it's impossible to get near them.
Agent Gera did.
And he's dead.
Not much of a view.
Kind of reminds me of your basement.
It's not dark enough.
You see the Bureau's case against me?
You know that your people won't share files with us.
What's this supposed to be?
Coffee.
I'll take your word for it.
They found two kilos of coke and 50 grand in counterfeit bills in my freezer.
I thought the coke in ice cream quarts was a nice touch.
It was an expensive one.
Jimmy Naps's going to a lot of trouble to frame youTobias...
Why now?
He knew I was vulnerable.
Vulnerable?
How?
Ari.
You laying this on me, huh?
I arranged your meeting with him, Jethro.
He's our only agent inside Al Qaeda, and what did you do?
You shot him.
I could have killed him.
Putting a round in his shoulder helped sell his cover to Al Qaeda.
Why don't you explain that to the director?
He didn't buy it when I did.
Okay.
If you think it'll do any good.
I'm not getting out of this, am I?
Ah, you'll get out of it.
It just may not be the way you like.
Duck, what do you got for me?
Ah, I've identified our second victim from the dental charts supplied by the FBI.
His name's Frank Pilato.
Frankie P.
He was to testify against Napalitano five years ago.
Disappeared walking his dog on a Sunday afternoon.
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon strolls can be dangerous.
Ducky, I thought you said the test indicated he was dead only five or six months ago.
I did.
Anyone care to guess how he died?
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say something to do with flames?
And you'd be wrong, Tony.
His throat was slit.
Bled to death.
Actually, no, Kate.
Lead poisoning.
Three nine-millimeter slugs to be exact.
Administered at close range.
He was kidnapped in '99.
And wasn't shot until a few months ago?
He was most likely executed years ago;
His body has only recently been exposed to the elements.
Excuse me.
His blood was drained after death... and his body frozen.
Jimmy Naps' version of the ice man.
They stashed the body in a cooler somewhere and then dump it years later when everyone's stopped looking.
Yeesh.
Shot, throat slit, frozen and burned?
Jimmy Naps definitely didn't like this dude.
The Mafia does tend to have a flair for the dramatic, Tony.
Anything on the finger parts Gunny De Luca picked up on the range?
I'm good, Jethro, but not that good.
I sent them up to Abby.
Kate, Tony.
On it, boss.
Agent Charles, can you get me the Bureau file on Fornell?
I haven't even seen it.
I get caught, I'm finished as a Federal Agent.
Don't get caught.
You know what I think, McGee?
What?
I think you're more interested in me than what I'm doing.
That's not true.
Wait, not that I-I'm not interested...
in you.
I am.
But I'm more interested in the work.
How could you say that?
Because what I'm looking at through the microscope...
Yeah?
...is up there on that screen.
Hey, guys!
You here for the finger or the blood?
What blood?
I found two types on Agent Gera's face.
One is his.
One is not.
So if he was beaten, you know, kind of like the way you were yesterday by Gibbs, it could be the killer's.
Kate, Kate, Kate, when I let Gibbs win, we all win.
And if I beat the crap out of him, who do you think he's going to take it out on?
Oh, that's right, all of us.
So you took a dive for the team?
Of course, McGee.
It's good to know.
It sure is.
Turn around.
I'm waiting for you to slap the back of my head, boss.
I'm not going to slap your head.
You're not?
What, you don't think I have a sense of humor?
Abbs, I need the DNA on the unknown blood.
I already started it.
Okay, what about the finger?
Any idea how long it was it on the range?
Well, ordinarily, you can't date bone unless it's been in the ground long enough to soak up fluorine.
Which is, like, hundreds of years.
But sometimes being in a place where things get blown up is a good thing.
I swabbed the finger for explosives and I found traces of one:
mercury fulminate,which was completely phased out by the military by 1986.
Well, that means the Mafia must have been dumping bodies down there for...
At least 18 years.
Thank you, McGee.
That's a good job, Abbs.
McGee, find a way to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Okay.
It's no fun if you know it's coming.
What was that for?
!
That's for eating my sandwich.
I know how to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Gonna sleep with him?
He was hit with two paternity suits in the last five years.
Beat them both with a DNA test.
Nice try, Probie, but those tests are sealed court records.
Those court records are sealed, McGee.
Hey, that's what I just said-- first!
But not the records from the lab that he used.
It's downtown.
You'll never get a judge to sign off on that warrant.
Maybe we don't need one.
That is, if you're ready to become a father.
I think she's talking to you, Probie.
We go down to the lab and see if I'm carrying your baby.
It'll be fun.
Oh, and we can steal Little Rickey's DNA test.
Photograph it for Abby.
I'll do it.
Why you?
You think anyone'd believe you actually slept with Kate?
Hey!
I figured out how to get Little Rickey's DNA records.
You mean I fig...
Hey, there is no 'I'in "team," McGee.
How?
Paternity clinic downtown.
Kate and I can have them in an hour.
Go get 'em.
Thank you, sir.
McGee.
I got the file on Fornell.
Good.
Not good.
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps was under surveillance.
He can explain this.
That photo came from an anonymous source.
From the newspaper blowup you can see the date.
The 17th?
Tobias had me pull surveillance on the 17th.
Why?
Never said.
But it's the day before Agent Gera disappeared.
He didn't hang himself, not Fornell.
That's the coward's way out and Tobias was no coward.
Only one person was in this cell with him today.
Who?
Me.
To cut him down.
Doctor...
I would like our M.E.,
Dr. Mallard, to receive a copy of your autopsy report.
Ducky?
Of course.
You writing my name right?
What?
!
I just want to know if it's mine.
She kind of sleeps around a lot, if you know what I mean.
If I did, it's 'cause he ain't any good in bed.
Least I didn't sleep with my cousin.
You slept with my sister.
I thought it was you.
She weighs 300 pounds.
She was wearing your earrings.
Now that's enough.
If you two can't be civil I'm going to have to ask you leave.
Look, is there anywhere that I can wait away from him, please?
I'm begging you.
There's an empty exam room behind you two doors on the right.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
She slept with my brother... and my best friend at the same time.
Okay, we've got Rickey's DNA from the clinic.
Let's see if we can match it to our sample from the crime scene.
We're cued up.
Initiating DNA match.
That's it, it's Rickey Napalitano's blood.
Thanks, Abs.
We made a good couple, Kate.
For The Jerry Springer Show.
Dig your threads.
You got to be kidding me?
Un-freaking-believable, he whacked himself.
Yeah, poor Fornell.
You won't see him no more, Pops.
What the...?
This guy's pulling us over, boss.
If I find out we got a busted taillight or something, Sallie boy, it's your ass.
Is there a problem, officer?
You're talking to the wrong person.
We got a warrant for your arrest, Little Dickey.
It's Rickey.
It's for murder, Dickey.
Come on.
Get out.
All right.
Hands on the hood, big guy.
Hand up.
Who the hell are you guys anyway, FBI?
NCIS.
Meat inspectors?
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?
They're Navy cops.
Turn around.
Arrested by Navy cops?
Talk about embarrassing.
At least you're hot, sweet...
Take it easy, take it easy.
Now that's embarrassing.
Let's go.
All right, don't worry.
Go with them, Rickey.
Our lawyers'll take care of this.
I don't think we've met, Agent...
Special Agent.
Gibbs.
Special Agent Gibbs.
So who is it my son was supposed to have whacked?
An FBI Agent.
Victor Gera.
I remember something about that.
Something happened on a marinease?
What was that?
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.
A bomb.
Yeah, yeah.
Suppose-
- God forbid-- that my son could be connected to this accident, what would you charge him with,
Special Agent Gibbs?
Manslaughter.
Manslaughter?
Manslaughter, what's the worst you can get with that, Sallie?
Four years.
Does one.
Might do the kid some good, season him up a bit.
Jail can be a dangerous place.
So they tell me.
You remind me of somebody, Special Agent Gibbs.
Who was that guy that always talking trash, that Fed?
Fornell?
Oh, yeah, Fornell.
That's it, yeah.
Whatever happened to him?
I think he hung himself.
Real sad.
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.
All that ambition and everything and he ends up doing the twist.
I get the government agent on your payroll by sunup, dirt bag... or Little Rickey does the twist.
Say I do this, all right?
What do I get?
I deliver Little Rickey to you, the evidence against him gets lost, and you never see me again.
You'd do all this just to clear Fornell's name?
He was my friend.
You can't threaten to kill someone in custody, Gibbs.
It wasn't a threat.
You'd really do it?
Hey.
You want to clear Tobias's name?
Hell, yes.
But not by letting Little Rickey off for Vic's murder.
Oh, he'll screw up again.
You think Jimmy Naps is going to make a swap and just let you walk away?
I hope not.
Gibbs.
Rear of the club.
One hour.
Lose the Feds in the building and in the alley.
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm operating on my own hook.
Pick another place.
You want me to pick a place?
I'm trying to show you there are no tricks here, Jimmy boy.
Coleman Park.
You know it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it.
Come alone.
I'm not that stupid.
All right, we each bring a man.
One hour.
And, Gibbs... you hurt my boy,
I'll kill your brothers, your uncles, your father...
and after their funerals, I'll kill you.
No brothers, no uncles.
My father passed years ago.
I do have three ex-wives whose names and addresses
I will gladly fax on to you.
Oh.
He hung up.
Whoa.
Where do you three think you're going?
With you, boss.
I can bring one back up.
Clearly you should take me.
Kate, with all due respect...
Are you kidding, Tony, why should he bring you?
With all due respect, you have no idea...
You're a total jackass.
Come on, you can conduct yourself in the field?
Agent Charles is going.
Me?
Are you kidding, boss?
He's kidding, right?
I don't think he is, Tony.
Gibbs, you need someone...
Someone who can verify the guy that Jimmy Naps turns over is FBI or Justice.
Can any of you do that?
He's right.
I know the players.
I go.
These bracelets are killing me.
You hear me?
Stay there, Sallie.
Stay, stay.
Where's my boy?
Where's Rickey?
Pops.
Hey.
You okay, son?
No.
Make them take these freaking bracelets off me.
Where's your end of the swap?
I leave my backup at the car, u do the same.
Sallie, bring him out.
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.Chop-chop, let's go.
We ain't got all day.
That's Abe.
Stupido.
Pop, I had nothing to do...
Not you, not you.This jabone.
What'd you think I was gonna do, let you come in my backyard and walk away with your coglioni?
You know what Primacord is, Jimmy?
Primacord?
That was Primacord.
This... is Primacord.
Oh!
Oh!
Pops!
And this is a dead-man's switch.
Oh, marone.
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.
All you have to do is give me your mole's name.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
You dumb Wop.
He never would've set it off.
The blast would kill him.
Who you gonna believe?
He's pazzo, Pop.
He'll do it.
He'll do it.
In fact, I think the blast should kill all of you.
You should've kept your mouth shut, Napalitano.
You lied to me, Jimmy.
Like you didn't expect it.
I just saved all our lives.
Now what?
Ciao.
Pops.
Pops!
You go to jail, you stay there a couple of years, it'll do you good, son.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, let's go.
Get this thing off me.
Here.
Do it yourself.
Boom.
What you doing there, Probie?
I'm trying to find what I missed.
How did Gibbs know that it was Charles?
You mean you didn't know?
He didn't know.
What, you knew?
We're seasoned investigators, McGee.
You have to start thinking outside the box.
Expect the unexpected.
Good advice, Tony.
Agent Todd.
DiNozzo.
McGee.
What?
Wow, she's pretty flexible.
Just don't let her catch you looking at her, Probie.
I think she saw me.
She gave me that look.
What look?
The look she's always giving you.
Yep.
She saw you.
Hope you wore a cup.
Okay, welcome to my version of close combat training.
McGee.
Yeah?
You start with Kate.
Go on.
All right.
You and me the ring today.
You sure about that?
I've been taking classes.
In what?
Boxing.
We're grappling today.
You want to grapple?
Yeah.
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just, you know, I did some wrestling in high school.
Did you, now?
Hoo-hoo, come on.
Why I ought to...
Not bad, DiNozzo.
Thanks.
You learn how to box in the Marines?
No.
Corps doesn't teach boxing.
That's your loss.
They teach fighting.
Your phone.
Gibbs.
Have I mentioned that
I was hand picked to protect the President of the United States?
Five times.
You gonna take that abuse, McGee?
No!
That's more like it, McGee.
Why were you holding back?
Well, you're...
I mean, I've nevrestled...
A girl?
No.
Tony...
I look like a girl to you?
All I see are two
NCIS Special Agents.
Me, too.
Training's over.
We're heading to Quantico.
Guy tried to outrun a 500-pound bomb.
And...?
He lost.
Hey.
She had three older brothers growing up.
I think there's some unresolved issues there.
You think?
Break out the gear.I'm going to find out who's in charge of this circus.
You didn't have to stop like that.
I know that.
Sorry about that, Probie.
But it's your fault.
My fault?
Yeah, the brakes grab.
It's your job to see the vehicle's in perfect running condition.
You should've called.
I could've saved you guys a trip.
Why don't we start with, who the hell are you?
Gunnery Sergeant De Luca, CID.
Is this your idea of how to run a crime scene, Gunnery Sergeant?
Nope.
It's my idea of how to run an accidendeath investigation,
Special Agent...?
Gibbs.
Well, a civilian decided to trespass at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Marines didn't spot him till it was too late.
What was a civilian doing down there?
My guess, he was a scavenger.
Lot of metal and scrap iron's been dumped here over the years.
Enough to risk blowing yourself up over?
I didn't say he was smart, Agent Gibbs.
But, hey, you want NCIS to handle the paperwork on this one?
Fine.
Get down there, secure the scene.
Just make sure your people stay inside the marked areas cleared by EOD
I don't need another dead civilian on my hands.
Attractive.
I want everybody off this range except EOD personnel.
What about Mr. Potato Head?
He stays.With luck, he'll spit on my boots.
Looking for a reason to whack him in the head, Gibbs?
No.
To shoot him.
Tony, didn't you tell methat you worked a case on a live-impact range once?
Yeah, that's right.
Fort A.P. Hill.
Tragic.
What happened?
EOD missed ordnance marking the path.
Boom!
Agent walking point, a probie, of course, blew his foot off.
You're kidding, right?
Of course I'm kidding...
Probie.
We're right behind you, buddy.
You're doing great.
Some of them are buried under the ground.
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,
I'd say our young victim was running when he was hit.
How can you tell, doctor?
Oh, I've seen far too many of these types of wounds during my tour in Vietnam.
What about the bruising on his wrists and face, Duck?
It's possible it was caused by blast concussion.
We'll know more when we get him back.
This guy was no scavenger, boss.
Salvatore Ferragamo's.
What?
Italian shoes.
Expensive.
Pair I got cost almost 500 bucks.
Well, not everybody shops at Wal-Mart.
I'm not saying you shop at Wal-Mart.
Or even that that's a bad thing.
How's it going, Kate?
Almost finished.
I've got McGee doing measurements.
What are you doing?
Following our vict prints.
They came from over there.
Well, how'd he get down here?
We're at least five miles from the nearest civilian road.
Someone dropped him off.
Hey!
That area hasn't been cleared yet.
Agent Gibbs!
Hey!
You trying to get yourself killed?
Are you deaf or nuts?
Little of both.
You still think that this was an accident, Gunny?
Jimmy, run this up to Abby for me.
Uh, sure.
Would it be okay if I stayed and chatted with her for awhile, doctor?
We're rather busy at the moment.
Okay, so you're saying that, uh... it's not okay, then?
Sorry.
Sorry.
The accent kind of throws me off sometimes.
He means well,but often ve an overwhelming urge to slap him.
Is that wrong?
Do it all the time.
So I've noticed.
But only on the back of the head.
A slap in the face would be humiliating.
Back of the head's a wake up call.
Looks like he got both.
You were right.
His facial injuries weren't from the bombs.
Our victim received a rather savage beating before his death.
And our crispy critter?
He wasn't burned by today's explosions.
Tests indicate the poor chap's been deceased east six months.
There are more bodies out there.
Yes.
I was afraid of that.
We've stumbled into a bone yard, Duck.
Yeah.
Serial killer's dumping ground.
Hey, Gunny!
What have we got here?
Well, that's not good.
hear that?
Yeah, what is that?
Evac!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Let's

So Ie them slike me....

And he's cute.
He's dead.
I know.
's also a macriminal
What I say, I'm attracted to the bad boy...
No way.
I'm get hacked.
A port sca
No, no, this is major.
ey've already burned thr the NCIS firewall.
Well, isolate e node and dump thn the other side of the router.
I'm trying!
It's moving too fast
Ohis is good.
They're using our connection with AFIS database-- sever it.
I can't, It's a point attack.
He or she is only going after my machine.
It's not possible, there's DOD Level Nine encryption.
It would take months...
Hey.
What is that,a video game?
No, Tony, we're getting hacked.
If they get into Abby's computer, the entire NCIS network is next.
I can't stop him.
Do something, McGee.
I've never seen code like this.
Ah, way to go, Abby.
I didn't do anything.
I thought you did?
No.
I did.
What the hell's going on here?
We were pulling a fingerprint match from the AFIS database and we set off some kind of cyber attack.
- They were definitely waiting for us.
- Who?
I don't know, Tony, and right now
I'm afraid to turn my machine back on.
The speed they were cracking our encryption at there's only a few computers in the world with that type of power.
Name them.
Well, the...the CERN institute in Geneva IBM's research facility, rumors of a few in China.
Oh, good, so it should be easy to find them.
China.
You want some?
Thanks.
Whoever this guy is, he's got some friends in high places, Gibbs.
Victor Gera.
AKA Guido Valentino.
Career criminal.
Guido Valentino?
That's the alias he used in L.A.
Started running numbers in Chicago as a kid, moved onto jacking cars as a teen, graduated to drug dealing on the West Coast.
Six months ago,he showed up in D.C.
Mafia?
Well, with names like Vic Gera and Guido Valentino, what else?
Probie, in case you forget,my name is
Tony DiNozzo.
Italiano.
Doesn't make me, Mafia, now does it?
I'm sorry.
Prego.
McGee, what's the connection between small-time hood and super computer?
Well, I have no idea, boss.
Ooh, wrong answer.
I'll go look for the right one now.
Why would the mob, or anyone, stash bodies at a Marine bombing range?
Because it's the last place you'd look for them.
Who'd be nuts enough to go down there looking for bodies?
Besides us?
Yeah, Gibbs.
You did what?
!
I'm on my way!
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.
He's not done screwing up my investigation.
Wow.
I thought you were the only one who could piss him off like that.
You never met his second wife.
I told you not to touch anything without my M.E. being present.
I didn't really have much of a choice.
It was near an unstable javelin round.
It'd likely kill me and another Marine when it exploded.Here.
You have a body that goes with this?
I think it was destroyed during the explosion.
You think?
Look, EOD kicked me off the range.
That whole entire area's been declared off limits 'til it's cleared.
How long?
Gibbs, there's decades of unexploded ordnance down there.
My guess, three weeks, minimum.
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.
Gunny, you coming?
I set up a virtual model emulating my system.
He comes back again, we can dump him into it.
Won't fool him for long.
All I need is a minute to back-trace his connection.
Okay, I'm ready.
Plug me in, McGee.
Round two.
He's still there and coming on strong.
Initiating my back-trace... now.
Oh, this guy is good.
He's almost made it through your little virtual world.
Yeah, but I'm better.
Oh, got you!
Ha!
Now let's see who we're dealing with.
Oh, my God.
Gibbs is going to kill you.
Kill me?
Why?
I'm not gonna tell him.
EOD has cleared 10% of the range so far.
In this small area and in a relatively short span of time, we found three bodies.
Do the math and we could be looking at potentially 30 or more victims concealed down there.
Gunny, I want you to coordinate with the Provost Martial.
I want a cordon around that range 24 hours a day.
Agent Gibbs, that's a lot of man power.
You really think...
Well, then you'd better get moving.
Right.
Is there some secret to getting on his good side?
Oh, there's no secret.
He doesn't have one.
Uh, excuse me, boss?
What?
We completed the back-trace on the intruder's system.
Yeah?
Yeah, and, uh...
Well, the thing is...
The hacker...
It's me.
Why is NCIS interested in Vic Gera, Gibbs?
Who said we were interested in him?
You ran his prints through AFIS.
Where'd you get them?
He gave them to us.
You have him in custody?
Technically speaking.
Where'd you find him?
On a live fire range at Quantico.
He was killed in a practice bomb drop this morning.
He Mafia?
He's an undercover FBI Agent, DiNozzo.
When we saw your print search, we were hoping Vic was alive.
I want his killer, Gibbs.
Is that an offer for a joint investigation?
I can't.
Kate, Tony, escort our guests out.
I need to talk to you alone.
Our usual conference room.
What's going on?
Fornell seems unusually upset.
For an FBI Agent.
How would you feel if one of your team was lying on a slab?
Depends on who it was.
You always a smart ass?
Just to you boys from the Hoover building.
I'm listening.
Jimmy Napalitano.
Know him?
Fat, ugly Mafioso, runs the business in Maryland, Virginia and D.C.
I've spent half my career trying to put that bastard behind bars.
Three trials, three times he walked on a technicality.
Tough to be sympathetic, considering you let Ari go.
Ari's a valuable intelligence asset, Gibbs.
Napalitano's nothing but a cheap hood.
Ari shot one of my people, kidnapped one of my agents, put a round through me.
I don't see the difference, Fornell.
I knew this was a waste of time.
At least we agree on something.
Anyone ever tell you you're an insufferable bastard?
Yeah.
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here because I need your help.
I offered a joint investigation.
You turned it down.
I couldn't say anything in front of those Agents.
You don't trust them?
Napalitano's always been a step ahead of me.
Every informant, every agent I get close to him ends up like that kid downstairs.
No one's that lucky.
He's got a mole in the Bureau.
Or someone with access to my operations.
Why not take it to Internal Affairs?
They can't help me.
But I can?
Realizing how sad this sounds, you're the closest thing I have to a friend, Gibbs.
You dying or something?
Okay, not dying.
This some part of a 12-step program?
Look, you going to help me or not?
I'm thinking about it.
It's settled then.
This isn't your style, Tobias.
I know it.
The Bureau believes that the mole who put my man on your slab.... is me.
Sorry, Tobias.
Hey, Tiffany, enough with the smoking already.
Get off my back, Ricky.
I pay you to dance, not get lung cancer.
All right, already.
I thought Tiffany was your numero uno?
Nah, I dumped her.
Rickey, how do ya dump somethin' that looks like that?
It's easy.
Ba-da bing, ba-da boom.
Ciao!
I gotta remember that one.
The comedian is Napalitano's son, Little Rickey.
Who's the muscle with him?
Sal Balducci, Napalitano's enforcer.
And that's the man himself.
Jimmy Napalitano, AKA Jimmy Naps.
He's politically connected and has the finest lawyers money can buy.
He's virtually untouchable.
We got a problem.
What kind of problem, Pops?
Not here.
Inside.
You got ears inside?
No.
Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.
Camera two, get me tight on the thug by the rear entrance.
_They find our bugs and wiretaps before we finish installing them.
-Or your mole tips 'em off.
There's no mole.
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.
They study us like we study them.
Rumor has it they have dossiers on all of us.
They even know we're watching them right now.
Camera one, show me Abe.
Hello, Abe.
"Abe?"
As in Vigoda.
That's the FBI call sign for him.
Oh, yeah, it does sort of look like him.
Tom, can you get me off, for old time's sake?
Sorry, Solly.
No can do.
You two through?
Sorry.
Point is, Agent Gibbs, it's impossible to get near them.
Agent Gera did.
And he's dead.
Not much of a view.
Kind of reminds me of your basement.
It'sot dark enough.
You see the Bureau's case against me?
You know that your people won't share files with us.
What's this supposed to be?
Coffee.
I'll take your word for it.
They found two kilos of coke and 50 grand in counterfeit bills in my freezer.
I thought the coke in ice cream quarts was a nice touch.
It was an expensive one.
Jimmy Naps's going to a lot of trouble to frame youTobias...
Why now?
He knew I was vulnerable.
Vulnerable?
How?
Ari.
You laying this on me, huh?
I arranged your meeting with him, Jethro.
He's our only agent inside Al Qaeda, and what did you do?
You shot him.
I could have killed him.
Putting a round in his shoulder helped sell his cover to Al Qaeda.
Why don't you explain that to the director?
He didn't buy it when I did.
Okay.
If you think it'll do any good.
I'm not getting out of this, am I?
Ah, you'll get out of it.
It just may not be the way you like.
Duck, what do you got for me?
Ah, I've identified our second victim from the dental charts supplied by the FBI.
His name's Frank Pilato.
Frankie P.
He was to testify against Napalitano five years ago.
Disappeared walking his dog on a Sunday afternoon.
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon strolls can be dangerous.
Ducky, I thought you said the test indicated he was dead only five or six months ago.
I did.
Anyone care to guess how he died?
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say something to do with flames?
And you'd be wrong, Tony.
His throat was slit.
Bled to death.
Actually, no, Kate.
Lead poisoning.
Three nine-millimeter slugs to be exact.
Administered at close range.
He was kidnapped in '99.
And wasn't shot until a few months ago?
He was most likely executed years ago;
His body has only recently been exposed to the elements.
Excuse me.
His blood was drained after death... and his body frozen.
Jimmy Naps' version of the ice man.
They stashed the body in a cooler somewhere and then dump it years later when everyone's stopped looking.
Yeesh.
Shot, throat slit, frozen and burned?
Jimmy Naps definitely didn't like this dude.
The Mafia does tend to have a flair for the dramatic, Tony.
Anything on the finger parts Gunny De Luca picked up on the range?
I'm good, Jethro, but not that good.
I sent them up to Abby.
Kate, Tony.
On it, boss.
Agent Charles, can you get me the Bureau file on Fornell?
I haven't even seen it.
I get caught, I'm finished as a Federal Agent.
Don't get caught.
You know what I think, McGee?
What?
I think you're more interested in me than what I'm doing.
That's not true.
Wait, not that I-I'm not interested...
in you.
I am.
But I'm more interested in the work.
How could you say that?
Because what I'm looking at through the microscope...
Yeah?
...is up there on that screen.
Hey, guys!
You here for the finger or the blood?
What blood?
I found two types on Agent Gera's face.
One is his.
One is not.
So if he was beaten, you know, kind of like the way you were yesterday by Gibbs, it could be the killer's.
Kate, Kate, Kate, when I let Gibbs win, we all win.
And if I beat the crap out of him, who do you think he's going to take it out on?
Oh, that's right, all of us.
So you took a dive for the team?
Of course, McGee.
It's good to know.
It sure is.
Turn around.
I'm waiting for you to slap the back of my head, boss.
I'm not going to slap your head.
You're not?
What, you don't think I have a sense of humor?
Abbs, I need the DNA on the unknown blood.
I already started it.
Okay, what about the finger?
Any idea how long it was it on the range?
Well, ordinarily, you can't date bone unless it's been in the ground long enough to soak up fluorine.
Which is, like, hundreds of years.
But sometimes being in a place where things get blown up is a good thing.
I swabbed the finger for explosives and I found traces of one:
mercury fulminate,which was completely phased out by the military by 1986.
Well, that means the Mafia must have been dumping bodies down there for...
At least 18 years.
Thank you, McGee.
That's a good job, Abbs.
McGee, find a way to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Okay.
It's no fun if you know it's coming.
What was that for?
!
That's for eating my sandwich.
I know how to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Gonna sleep with him?
He was hit with two paternity suits in the last five years.
Beat them both with a DNA test.
Nice try, Probie, but those tests are sealed court records.
Those court records are sealed, McGee.
Hey, that's what I just said-- first!
But not the records from the lab that he used.
It's downtown.
You'll never get a judge to sign off on that warrant.
Maybe we don't need one.
That is, if you're ready to become a father.
I think she's talking to you, Probie.
We go down to the lab and see if I'm carrying your baby.
It'll be fun.
Oh, and we can steal Little Rickey's DNA test.
Photograph it for Abby.
I'll do it.
Why you?
You think anyone'd believe you actually slept with Kate?
Hey!
I figured out how to get Little Rickey's DNA records.
You mean I fig...
Hey, there is no 'I'in "team," McGee.
How?
Paternity clinic downtown.
Kate and I can have them in an hour.
Go get 'em.
Thank you, sir.
McGee.
I got the file on Fornell.
Good.
Not good.
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps was under surveillance.
He can explain this.
That photo came from an anonymous source.
From the newspaper blowup you can see the date.
The 17th?
Tobias had me pull surveillance on the 17th.
Why?
Never said.
But it's the day before Agent Gera disappeared.
He didn't hang himself, not Fornell.
That's the coward's way out and Tobias was no coward.
Only one person was in this cell with him today.
Who?
Me.
To cut him down.
Doctor...
I would like our M.E.,
Dr. Mallard, to receive a copy of your autopsy report.
Ducky?
Of course.
You writing my name right?
What?
!
I just want to know if it's mine.
She kind of sleeps around a lot, if you know what I mean.
If I did, it's 'cause he ain't any good in bed.
Least I didn't sleep with my cousin.
You slept with my sister.
I thought it was you.
She weighs 300 pounds.
She was wearing your earrings.
Now that's enough.
If you two can't be civil I'm going to have to ask you leave.
Look, is there anywhere that I can wait away from him, please?
I'm begging you.
There's an empty exam room behind you two doors on the right.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
She slept with my brother... and my best friend at the same time.
Okay, we've got Rickey's DNA from the clinic.
Let's see if we can match it to our sample from the crime scene.
We're cued up.
Initiating DNA match.
That's it, it's Rickey Napalitano's blood.
Thanks, Abs.
We made a good couple, Kate.
For The Jerry Springer Show.
Dig your threads.
You got to be kidding me?
Un-freaking-believable, he whacked himself.
Yeah, poor Fornell.
You won't see him no more, Pops.
What the...?
This guy's pulling us over, boss.
If I find out we got a busted taillight or something, Sallie boy, it's your ass.
Is there a problem, officer?
You're talking to the wrong person.
Buona sera.
We got a warrant for your arrest, Little Dickey.
It's Rickey.
It's for murder, Dickey.
Come on.
Get out.
All right.
Hands on the hood, big guy.
Hand up.
Who the hell are you guys anyway, FBI?
NCIS.
Meat inspectors?
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?
They're Navy cops.
Turn around.
Arrested by Navy cops?
Talk about embarrassing.
At least you're hot, sweet...
Take it easy, take it easy.
Now that's embarrassing.
Let's go.
All right, don't worry.
Go with them, Rickey.
Our lawyers'll take care of this.
I don't think we've met, Agent...
Special Agent.
Gibbs.
Special Agent Gibbs.
So who is it my son was supposed to have whacked?
An FBI Agent.
Victor Gera.
I remember something about that.
Something happened on a marinease?
What was that?
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.
A bomb.
Yeah, yeah.
Suppose-
- God forbid-- that my son could be connected to this accident, what would you charge him with,
Special Agent Gibbs?
Manslaughter.
Manslaughter?
Manslaughter, what's the worst you can get with that, Sallie?
Four years.
Does one.
Might do the kid some good, season him up a bit.
Jail can be a dangerous place.
So they tell me.
You remind me of somebody, Special Agent Gibbs.
Who was that guy that always talking trash, that Fed?
Fornell?
Oh, yeah, Fornell.
That's it, yeah.
Whatever happened to him?
I think he hung himself.
Real sad.
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.
All that ambition and everything and he ends up doing the twist.
I get the government agent on your payroll by sunup, dirt bag... or Little Rickey does the twist.
Say I do this, all right?
What do I get?
I deliver Little Rickey to you, the evidence against him gets lost, and you never see me again.
You'd do all this just to clear Fornell's name?
He was my friend.
You can't threaten to kill someone in custody, Gibbs.
It wasn't a threat.
You'd really do it?
Hey.
You want to clear Tobias's name?
Hell, yes.
But not by letting Little Rickey off for Vic's murder.
Oh, he'll screw up again.
You think Jimmy Naps is going to make a swap and just let you walk away?
I hope not.
Gibbs.
Rear of the club.
One hour.
Lose the Feds in the building and in the alley.
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm operating on my own hook.
Pick another place.
You want me to pick a place?
I'm trying to show you there are no tricks here, Jimmy boy.
Coleman Park.
You know it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it.
Come alone.
I'm not that stupid.
All right, we each bring a man.
One hour.
And, Gibbs... you hurt my boy,
I'll kill your brothers, your uncles, your father...
and after their funerals, I'll kill you.
No brothers, no uncles.
My father passed years ago.
I do have three ex-wives whose names and addresses
I will gladly fax on to you.
Oh.
He hung up.
Whoa.
Where do you three think you're going?
With you, boss.
I can bring one back up.
Clearly you should take me.
Kate, with all due respect...
Are you kidding, Tony, why should he bring you?
With all due respect, you have no idea...
You're a total jackass.
Come on, you can conduct yourself in the field?
Agent Charles is going.
Me?
Are you kidding, boss?
He's kidding, right?
I don't think he is, Tony.
Gibbs, you need someone...
Someone who can verify the guy that Jimmy Naps turns over is FBI or Justice.
Can any of you do that?
He's right.
I know the players.
I go.
These bracelets are killing me.
You hear me?
Stay there, Sallie.
Stay, stay.
Where's my boy?
Where's Rickey?
Pops.
Hey.
You okay, son?
No.
Make them take these freaking bracelets off me.
Where's your end of the swap?
I leave my backup at the car, u do the same.
Sallie, bring him out.
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.Chop-chop, let's go.
We ain't got all day.
That's Abe.
Stupido.
Pop, I had nothing to do...
Not you, not you.This jabone.
What'd you think I was gonna do, let you come in my backyard and walk away with your coglioni?
You know what Primacord is, Jimmy?
Primacord?
That was Primacord.
This... is Primacord.
Oh!
Oh!
Pops!
And this is a dead-man's switch.
Oh, marone.
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.
All you have to do is give me your mole's name.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
You dumb Wop.
He never would've set it off.
The blast would kill him.
Who you gonna believe?
He's pazzo, Pop.
He'll do it.
He'll do it.
In fact, I think the blast should kill all of you.
You should've kept your mouth shut, Napalitano.
You lied to me, Jimmy.
Like you didn't expect it.
I just saved all our lives.
Now what?
Ciao.
Pops.
Pops!
You go to jail, you stay there a couple of years, it'll do you good, son.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, let's go.
Get this thing off me.
Here.
Do it yourself.
Boom.
What you doing there, Probie?
I'm trying to find what I missed.
How did Gibbs know that it was Charles?
You mean you didn't know?
He didn't know.
What, you knew?
We're seasoned investigators, McGee.
You have to start thinking outside the box.
Expect the unexpected.
Good advice, Tony.
Agent Todd.
DiNozzo.
McGee.
What?
Wow, she's pretty flexible.
Just don't let her catch you looking at her, Probie.
I think she saw me.
She gave me that look.
What look?
The look she's always giving you.
Yep.
She saw you.
Hope you wore a cup.
Okay, welcome to my version of close combat training.
McGee.
Yeah?
You start with Kate.
Go on.
All right.
You and me the ring today.
You sure about that?
I've been taking classes.
In what?
Boxing.
We're grappling today.
You want to grapple?
Yeah.
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just, you know, I did some wrestling in high school.
Did you, now?
Hoo-hoo, come on.
Why I ought to...
Not bad, DiNozzo.
Thanks.
You learn how to box in the Marines?
No.
Corps doesn't teach boxing.
That's your loss.
They teach fighting.
Your phone.
Gibbs.
Have I mentioned that
I was hand picked to protect the President of the United States?
Five times.
You gonna take that abuse, McGee?
No!
That's more like it, McGee.
Why were you holding back?
Well, you're...
I mean, I've nevrestled...
A girl?
No.
Tony...
I look like a girl to you?
All I see are two
NCIS Special Agents.
Me, too.
Training's over.
We're heading to Quantico.
Guy tried to outrun a 500-pound bomb.
And...?
He lost.
Hey.
She had three older brothers growing up.
I think there's some unresolved issues there.
You think?
Break out the gear.
I'm going to find out who's in charge of this circus.
You didn't have to stop like that.
I know that.
Sorry about that, Probie.
But it's your fault.
My fault?
Yeah, the brakes grab.
It's your job to see the vehicle's in perfect running condition.
You should've called.
I could've saved you guys a trip.
Why don't we start with, who the hell are you?
Gunnery Sergeant De Luca, CID.
Is this your idea of how to run a crime scene, Gunnery Sergeant?
Nope.
It's my idea of how to run an accidendeath investigation,
Special Agent...?
Gibbs.
Well, a civilian decided to trespass at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Marines didn't spot him till it was too late.
What was a civilian doing down there?
My guess, he was a scavenger.
Lot of metal and scrap iron's been dumped here over the years.
Enough to risk blowing yourself up over?
I didn't say he was smart, Agent Gibbs.
But, hey, you want NCIS to handle the paperwork on this one?
Fine.
Get down there, secure the scene.
Just make sure your people stay inside the marked areas cleared by EOD
I don't need another dead civilian on my hands.
Attractive.
I want everybody off this range except EOD personnel.
What about Mr. Potato Head?
He stays.
With luck, he'll spit on my boots.
Looking for a reason to whack him in the head, Gibbs?
No.
To shoot him.
Tony, didn't you tell methat you worked a case on a live-impact range once?
Yeah, that's right.
Fort A.P. Hill.
Tragic.
What happened?
EOD missed ordnance marking the path.
Boom!
Agent walking point, a probie, of course, blew his foot off.
You're kidding, right?
Of course I'm kidding...
Probie.
We're right behind you, buddy.
You're doing great.
Some of them are buried under the ground.
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,
I'd say our young victim was running when he was hit.
How can you tell, doctor?
Oh, I've seen far too many of these types of wounds during my tour in Vietnam.
What about the bruising on his wrists and face, Duck?
It's possible it was caused by blast concussion.
We'll know more when we get him back.
This guy was no scavenger, boss.
Salvatore Ferragamo's.
What?
Italian shoes.
Expensive.
Pair I got cost almost 500 bucks.
Well, not everybody shops at Wal-Mart.
I'm not saying you shop at Wal-Mart.
Or even that that's a bad thing.
How's it going, Kate?
Almost finished.
I've got McGee doing measurements.
What are you doing?
Following our vict prints.
They came from over there.
Well, how'd he get down here?
We're at least five miles from the nearest civilian road.
Someone dropped him off.
Hey!
That area hasn't been cleared yet.
Agent Gibbs!
Hey!
You trying to get yourself killed?
Are you deaf or nuts?
Little of both.
You still think that this was an accident, Gunny?
Jimmy, run this up to Abby for me.
Uh, sure.
Would it be okay if I stayed and chatted with her for awhile, doctor?
We're rather busy at the moment.
Okay, so you're saying that, uh... it's not okay, then?
Sorry.
Sorry.
The accent kind of throws me off sometimes.
He means well, but often I have an overwhelming urge to slap him.
Is that wrong?
Do it all the time.
So I've noticed.
But only on the back of the head.
A slap in the face would be humiliating.
Back of the head's a wake up call.
Looks like he got both.
You were right.
His facial injuries weren't from the bombs.
Our victim received a rather savage beating before his death.
And our crispy critter?
He wasn't burned by today's explosions.
Tests indicate the poor chap's been deceased east six months.
There are more bodies out there.
Yes.
I was afraid of that.
We've stumbled into a bone yard, Duck.
Yeah.
Serial killer's dumping ground.
Hey, Gunny!
Have a look.
What have we got here?
Well, that's not good.
You hear that?
Yeah, what is that?
Evac!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Well at least I get Gibbs a finger.
I heared Kate kicked your but this morning, McGee.
Oh, you heared wrong.
It wasn't my butt.
She kicked you in the...
Yeah.
I thought I was joining a Federal Agency not reliving my junior year in high school.
Just remember, they torture you because they care.
So I make them dislike me...
Never get worth.
It's what I thought.
Hey!
I just I.D.'d your body.
And he's cute.
He's dead.
I know.
He's also a major criminal.
What can I say?
I'm attracted to that bad boy type...
No way.
I'm get hacked.
A port scan?
No, no, this is major.
They've already burned to the NCIS public firewall.
Well, isolate the node and dump then the other side of the router.
I'm trying!
It's moving too fast
Oh, this is not good.
They're using our connection with AFIS database- sever it.
I can't, It's a point attack.
He or she is only going after my machine.
It's not possible, there's DOD Level Nine encryption.
It would take months...
Hey.
What is that, a video game?
No, Tony, we're getting hacked.
If they get into Abby's computer, the entire NCIS network is next.
I can't stop him.
Do something, McGee.
I've never seen code like this.
Ah, way to go, Abby.
I didn't do anything.
I thought you did?
No.
I did.
What the hell's going on here?
We were pulling a fingerprint match from the AFIS database and we set off some kind of cyber attack.
- They were definitely waiting for us.
- Who?
I don't know, Tony, and right now
I'm afraid to turn my machine back on.
The speed they were cracking our encryption at there's only a few computers in the world with that type of power.
Name them.
Well, the... the CERN institute in Geneva, IBM's research facility, rumors of a few in China.
Oh, good, so it should be easy to find them.
Where is my match?
China.
You want some?
Thanks.
Whoever this guy is, he's got some friends in high places, Gibbs.
Victor Gera.
AKA Guido Valentino.
Career criminal.
Guido Valentino?
That's the alias he used in L.A.
Started running numbers in Chicago as a kid, moved onto jacking cars as a teen, graduated to drug dealing on the West Coast.
Six months ago, he showed up in D.C.
Mafia?
Well, with names like Vic Gera and Guido Valentino, what else?
Probie, in case you forget, my name is
Tony DiNozzo.
Italiano.
Doesn't make me, Mafia, now does it?
No.
Of course not.
I'm sorry.
Prego.
McGee, what's the connection between small-time hood and super computer?
Well, I have no idea, boss.
Ooh, wrong answer.
I'll go look for the right one now.
Why would the mob, or anyone, stash bodies at a Marine bombing range?
Because it's the last place you'd look for them.
Who'd be nuts enough to go down there looking for bodies?
Besides us?
Yeah, Gibbs.
You did what?
!
I'm on my way!
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.
He's not done screwing up my investigation.
Wow.
I thought you were the only one who could piss him off like that.
You never met his second wife.
I told you not to touch anything without my M.E. being present.
I didn't really have much of a choice.
It was near an unstable javelin round.
It'd likely kill me and another Marine when it exploded.
Here.
You have a body that goes with this?
I think it was destroyed during the explosion.
You think?
Look, EOD kicked me off the range.
That whole entire area's been declared off limits 'til it's cleared.
How long?
Gibbs, there's decades of unexploded ordnance down there.
My guess, three weeks, minimum.
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.
Gunny, you coming?
I set up a virtual model emulating my system.
He comes back again, we can dump him into it.
Won't fool him for long.
All I need is a minute to back-trace his connection.
Okay, I'm ready.
Plug me in, McGee.
Round two.
He's still there and coming on strong.
Initiating my back-trace... now.
Oh, this guy is good.
He's almost made it through your little virtual world.
Yeah, but I'm better.
Oh, got you!
Ha!
Now let's see who we're dealing with.
Oh, my God.
Gibbs is going to kill you.
Kill me?
Why?
I'm not gonna tell him.
EOD has cleared 10% of the range so far.
In this small area and in a relatively short span of time, we found three bodies.
Do the math and we could be looking at potentially 30 or more victims concealed down there.
Gunny, I want you to coordinate with the Provost Martial.
I want a cordon around that range 24 hours a day.
Agent Gibbs, that's a lot of man power.
You really think...
Well, then you'd better get moving.
Right.
Is there some secret to getting on his good side?
Oh, there's no secret.
He doesn't have one.
Uh, excuse me, boss?
What?
We completed the back-trace on the intruder's system.
Yeah?
Yeah, and, uh...
Well, the thing is...
The hacker...
It's me.
Why is NCIS interested in Vic Gera, Gibbs?
Who said we were interested in him?
You ran his prints through AFIS.
Where'd you get them?
He gave them to us.
You have him in custody?
Technically speaking.
Where'd you find him?
On a live fire range at Quantico.
He was killed in a practice bomb drop this morning.
He Mafia?
He's an undercover FBI Agent, DiNozzo.
When we saw your print search, we were hoping Vic was alive.
I want his killer, Gibbs.
Is that an offer for a joint investigation?
I can't.
Kate, Tony, escort our guests out.
I need to talk to you alone.
Our usual conference room.
What's going on?
Fornell seems unusually upset.
For an FBI Agent.
How would you feel if one of your team was lying on a slab?
Depends on who it was.
You always a smart ass?
Just to you boys from the Hoover building.
I'm listening.
Jimmy Napalitano.
Know him?
Fat, ugly Mafioso, runs the business in Maryland, Virginia and D.C.
I've spent half my career trying to put that bastard behind bars.
Three trials, three times he walked on a technicality.
Tough to be sympathetic, considering you let Ari go.
Ari's a valuable intelligence asset, Gibbs.
Napalitano's nothing but a cheap hood.
Ari shot one of my people, kidnapped one of my agents, put a round through me.
I don't see the difference, Fornell.
I knew this was a waste of time.
At least we agree on something.
Anyone ever tell you you're an insufferable bastard?
Yeah.
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here because I need your help.
I offered a joint investigation.
You turned it down.
I couldn't say anything in front of those Agents.
You don't trust them?
Napalitano's always been a step ahead of me.
Every informant, every agent I get close to him ends up like that kid downstairs.
No one's that lucky.
He's got a mole in the Bureau.
Or someone with access to my operations.
Why not take it to Internal Affairs?
They can't help me.
But I can?
Realizing how sad this sounds, you're the closest thing I have to a friend, Gibbs.
You dying or something?
Okay, not dying.
This some part of a 12-step program?
Look, you going to help me or not?
I'm thinking about it.
It's settled then.
This isn't your style, Tobias.
I know it.
The Bureau believes that the mole who put my man on your slab... is me.
Sorry, Tobias.
Hey, Tiffany, enough with the smoking already.
Get off my back, Ricky.
I pay you to dance, not get lung cancer.
All right, already.
I thought Tiffany was your numero uno?
Nah, I dumped her.
Rickey, how do ya dump somethin' that looks like that?
It's easy.
Ba-da bing, ba-da boom.
Ciao!
I gotta remember that one.
The comedian is Napalitano's son, Little Rickey.
Who's the muscle with him?
Sal Balducci, Napalitano's enforcer.
And that's the man himself.
Jimmy Napalitano, AKA Jimmy Naps.
He's politically connected and has the finest lawyers money can buy.
He's virtually untouchable.
We got a problem.
What kind of problem, Pops?
Not here.
Inside.
You got ears inside?
No.
Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.
Camera two, get me tight on the thug by the rear entrance.
- They find our bugs and wiretaps before we finish installing them.
- Or your mole tips 'em off.
There's no mole.
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.
They study us like we study them.
Rumor has it they have dossiers on all of us.
They even know we're watching them right now.
Camera one, show me Abe.
Hello, Abe.
"Abe?"
As in Vigoda.
That's the FBI call sign for him.
Oh, yeah, it does sort of look like him.
Tom, can you get me off, for old time's sake?
Sorry, Solly.
No can do.
You two through?
Sorry.
Point is, Agent Gibbs, it's impossible to get near them.
Agent Gera did.
And he's dead.
Not much of a view.
Kind of reminds me of your basement.
It'sot dark enough.
You see the Bureau's case against me?
You know that your people won't share files with us.
What's this supposed to be?
Coffee.
I'll take your word for it.
They found two kilos of coke and 50 grand in counterfeit bills in my freezer.
I thought the coke in ice cream quarts was a nice touch.
It was an expensive one.
Jimmy Naps's going to a lot of trouble to frame youTobias...
Why now?
He knew I was vulnerable.
Vulnerable?
How?
Ari.
You laying this on me, huh?
I arranged your meeting with him, Jethro.
He's our only agent inside Al Qaeda, and what did you do?
You shot him.
I could have killed him.
Putting a round in his shoulder helped sell his cover to Al Qaeda.
Why don't you explain that to the director?
He didn't buy it when I did.
Okay.
If you think it'll do any good.
I'm not getting out of this, am I?
Ah, you'll get out of it.
It just may not be the way you like.
Duck, what do you got for me?
Ah, I've identified our second victim from the dental charts supplied by the FBI.
His name's Frank Pilato.
Frankie P.
He was to testify against Napalitano five years ago.
Disappeared walking his dog on a Sunday afternoon.
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon strolls can be dangerous.
Ducky, I thought you said the test indicated he was dead only five or six months ago.
I did.
Anyone care to guess how he died?
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say something to do with flames?
And you'd be wrong, Tony.
His throat was slit.
Bled to death.
Actually, no, Kate.
Lead poisoning.
Three nine-millimeter slugs to be exact.
Administered at close range.
He was kidnapped in '99.
And wasn't shot until a few months ago?
He was most likely executed years ago;
His body has only recently been exposed to the elements.
Excuse me.
His blood was drained after death... and his body frozen.
Jimmy Naps' version of the ice man.
They stashed the body in a cooler somewhere and then dump it years later when everyone's stopped looking.
Yeesh.
Shot, throat slit, frozen and burned?
Jimmy Naps definitely didn't like this dude.
The Mafia does tend to have a flair for the dramatic, Tony.
Anything on the finger parts Gunny De Luca picked up on the range?
I'm good, Jethro, but not that good.
I sent them up to Abby.
Kate, Tony.
On it, boss.
Agent Charles, can you get me the Bureau file on Fornell?
I haven't even seen it.
I get caught, I'm finished as a Federal Agent.
Don't get caught.
You know what I think, McGee?
What?
I think you're more interested in me than what I'm doing.
That's not true.
Wait, not that I-I'm not interested... in you.
I am.
But I'm more interested in the work.
How could you say that?
Because what I'm looking at through the microscope...
Yeah?
...is up there on that screen.
Hey, guys!
You here for the finger or the blood?
What blood?
I found two types on Agent Gera's face.
One is his.
One is not.
So if he was beaten, you know, kind of like the way you were yesterday by Gibbs, it could be the killer's.
Kate, Kate, Kate, when I let Gibbs win, we all win.
And if I beat the crap out of him, who do you think he's going to take it out on?
Oh, that's right, all of us.
So you took a dive for the team?
Of course, McGee.
It's good to know.
It sure is.
Turn around.
I'm waiting for you to slap the back of my head, boss.
I'm not going to slap your head.
You're not?
What, you don't think I have a sense of humor?
Abbs, I need the DNA on the unknown blood.
I already started it.
Okay, what about the finger?
Any idea how long it was it on the range?
Well, ordinarily, you can't date bone unless it's been in the ground long enough to soak up fluorine.
Which is, like, hundreds of years.
But sometimes being in a place where things get blown up is a good thing.
I swabbed the finger for explosives and I found traces of one:
mercury fulminate, which was completely phased out by the military by 1986.
Well, that means the Mafia must have been dumping bodies down there for...
At least 18 years.
Thank you, McGee.
That's a good job, Abbs.
McGee, find a way to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Okay.
It's no fun if you know it's coming.
What was that for?
!
That's for eating my sandwich.
I know how to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Gonna sleep with him?
He was hit with two paternity suits in the last five years.
Beat them both with a DNA test.
Nice try, Probie, but those tests are sealed court records.
Those court records are sealed, McGee.
Hey, that's what I just said- first!
But not the records from the lab that he used.
It's downtown.
You'll never get a judge to sign off on that warrant.
Maybe we don't need one.
That is, if you're ready to become a father.
I think she's talking to you, Probie.
We go down to the lab and see if I'm carrying your baby.
It'll be fun.
Oh, and we can steal Little Rickey's DNA test.
Photograph it for Abby.
I'll do it.
Why you?
You think anyone'd believe you actually slept with Kate?
Hey!
I figured out how to get Little Rickey's DNA records.
You mean I fig...
Hey, there is no 'I'in "team", McGee.
How?
Paternity clinic downtown.
Kate and I can have them in an hour.
Go get 'em.
Thank you, sir.
McGee.
I got the file on Fornell.
Good.
Not good.
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps was under surveillance.
He can explain this.
That photo came from an anonymous source.
From the newspaper blowup you can see the date.
The 17th?
Tobias had me pull surveillance on the 17th.
Why?
Never said.
But it's the day before Agent Gera disappeared.
He didn't hang himself, not Fornell.
That's the coward's way out and Tobias was no coward.
Only one person was in this cell with him today.
Who?
Me.
To cut him down.
Doctor...
I would like our M.E.,
Dr. Mallard, to receive a copy of your autopsy report.
Ducky?
Of course.
You writing my name right?
What?
!
I just want to know if it's mine.
She kind of sleeps around a lot, if you know what I mean.
If I did, it's 'cause he ain't any good in bed.
Least I didn't sleep with my cousin.
You slept with my sister.
I thought it was you.
She weighs 300 pounds.
She was wearing your earrings.
Now that's enough.
If you two can't be civil I'm going to have to ask you leave.
Look, is there anywhere that I can wait away from him, please?
I'm begging you.
There's an empty exam room behind you two doors on the right.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
She slept with my brother... and my best friend at the same time.
Okay, we've got Rickey's DNA from the clinic.
Let's see if we can match it to our sample from the crime scene.
We're cued up.
Initiating DNA match.
That's it, it's Rickey Napalitano's blood.
Thanks, Abs.
We made a good couple, Kate.
For The Jerry Springer Show.
Dig your threads.
You got to be kidding me?
Un-freaking-believable, he whacked himself.
Yeah, poor Fornell.
You won't see him no more, Pops.
What the...?
This guy's pulling us over, boss.
If I find out we got a busted taillight or something, Sallie boy, it's your ass.
Is there a problem, officer?
You're talking to the wrong person.
We got a warrant for your arrest, Little Dickey.
It's Rickey.
It's for murder, Dickey.
Come on.
Get out.
All right.
Hands on the hood, big guy.
Hand up.
Who the hell are you guys anyway, FBI?
NCIS.
Meat inspectors?
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?
They're Navy cops.
Turn around.
Arrested by Navy cops?
Talk about embarrassing.
At least you're hot, sweet...
Take it easy, take it easy.
Now that's embarrassing.
Let's go.
All right, don't worry.
Go with them, Rickey.
Our lawyers'll take care of this.
I don't think we've met, Agent...
Special Agent.
Gibbs.
Special Agent Gibbs.
So who is it my son was supposed to have whacked?
An FBI Agent.
Victor Gera.
I remember something about that.
Something happened on a marine base?
What was that?
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.
A bomb.
Yeah, yeah.
Suppose
- God forbid- that my son could be connected to this accident, what would you charge him with,
Special Agent Gibbs?
Manslaughter.
Manslaughter?
Manslaughter, what's the worst you can get with that, Sallie?
Four years.
Does one.
Might do the kid some good, season him up a bit.
Jail can be a dangerous place.
So they tell me.
You remind me of somebody, Special Agent Gibbs.
Who was that guy that always talking trash, that Fed?
Fornell?
Oh, yeah, Fornell.
That's it, yeah.
Whatever happened to him?
I think he hung himself.
Real sad.
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.
All that ambition and everything and he ends up doing the twist.
I get the government agent on your payroll by sunup, dirt bag... or Little Rickey does the twist.
Say I do this, all right?
What do I get?
I deliver Little Rickey to you, the evidence against him gets lost, and you never see me again.
You'd do all this just to clear Fornell's name?
He was my friend.
You can't threaten to kill someone in custody, Gibbs.
It wasn't a threat.
You'd really do it?
Hey.
You want to clear Tobias's name?
Hell, yes.
But not by letting Little Rickey off for Vic's murder.
Oh, he'll screw up again.
You think Jimmy Naps is going to make a swap and just let you walk away?
I hope not.
Gibbs.
Rear of the club.
One hour.
Lose the Feds in the building and in the alley.
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm operating on my own hook.
Pick another place.
You want me to pick a place?
I'm trying to show you there are no tricks here, Jimmy boy.
Coleman Park.
You know it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it.
Come alone.
I'm not that stupid.
All right, we each bring a man.
One hour.
And, Gibbs... you hurt my boy,
I'll kill your brothers, your uncles, your father... and after their funerals, I'll kill you.
No brothers, no uncles.
My father passed years ago.
I do have three ex-wives whose names and addresses
I will gladly fax on to you.
Oh.
He hung up.
Whoa.
Where do you three think you're going?
With you, boss.
I can bring one back up.
Clearly you should take me.
Kate, with all due respect...
Are you kidding, Tony, why should he bring you?
With all due respect, you have no idea...
You're a total jackass.
Come on, you can conduct yourself in the field?
Agent Charles is going.
Me?
Are you kidding, boss?
He's kidding, right?
I don't think he is, Tony.
Gibbs, you need someone...
Someone who can verify the guy that Jimmy Naps turns over is FBI or Justice.
Can any of you do that?
He's right.
I know the players.
I go.
These bracelets are killing me.
You hear me?
Stay there, Sallie.
Stay, stay.
Where's my boy?
Where's Rickey?
Pops.
Hey.
You okay, son?
No.
Make them take these freaking bracelets off me.
Where's your end of the swap?
I leave my backup at the car, u do the same.
Sallie, bring him out.
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Chop-chop, let's go.
We ain't got all day.
That's Abe.
Stupido.
Pop, I had nothing to do...
Not you, not you.
This jabone.
What'd you think I was gonna do, let you come in my backyard and walk away with your coglioni?
You know what Primacord is, Jimmy?
Primacord?
That was Primacord.
This... is Primacord.
Oh!
Oh!
Pops!
And this is a dead-man's switch.
Oh, marone.
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.
All you have to do is give me your mole's name.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
You dumb Wop.
He never would've set it off.
The blast would kill him.
Who you gonna believe?
He's pazzo, Pop.
He'll do it.
He'll do it.
In fact, I think the blast should kill all of you.
You should've kept your mouth shut, Napalitano.
You lied to me, Jimmy.
Like you didn't expect it.
I just saved all our lives.
Now what?
Ciao.
Pops.
Pops!
You go to jail, you stay there a couple of years, it'll do you good, son.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, let's go.
Get this thing off me.
Here.
Do it yourself.
Boom.
What you doing there, Probie?
I'm trying to find what I missed.
How did Gibbs know that it was Charles?
You mean you didn't know?
He didn't know.
What, you knew?
We're seasoned investigators, McGee.
You have to start thinking outside the box.
Expect the unexpected.
Good advice, Tony.
Agent Todd.
DiNozzo.
McGee.
What?
Wow, she's pretty flexible.
Just don't let her catch you looking at her, Probie.
I think she saw me.
She gave me that look.
What look?
The look she's always giving you.
Yep.
She saw you.
Hope you wore a cup.
Okay, welcome to my version of close combat training.
McGee.
Yeah?
You start with Kate.
Go on.
All right.
You and me the ring today.
You sure about that?
I've been taking classes.
In what?
Boxing.
We're grappling today.
You want to grapple?
Yeah.
You have a problem with that?
No, it's just, you know, I did some wrestling in high school.
Did you, now?
Hoo-hoo, come on.
Why I ought to...
Not bad, DiNozzo.
Thanks.
You learn how to box in the Marines?
No.
Corps doesn't teach boxing.
That's your loss.
They teach fighting.
Your phone.
Gibbs.
Have I mentioned that
I was hand picked to protect the President of the United States?
Five times.
You gonna take that abuse, McGee?
No!
That's more like it, McGee.
Why were you holding back?
Well, you're...
I mean, I've nevrestled...
A girl?
No.
Tony...
I look like a girl to you?
All I see are two
NCIS Special Agents.
Me, too.
Training's over.
We're heading to Quantico.
Guy tried to outrun a 500-pound bomb.
And...?
He lost.
Hey.
She had three older brothers growing up.
I think there's some unresolved issues there.
You think?
Break out the gear.
I'm going to find out who's in charge of this circus.
You didn't have to stop like that.
I know that.
Sorry about that, Probie.
But it's your fault.
My fault?
Yeah, the brakes grab.
It's your job to see the vehicle's in perfect running condition.
You should've called.
I could've saved you guys a trip.
Why don't we start with, who the hell are you?
Gunnery Sergeant De Luca, CID.
Is this your idea of how to run a crime scene, Gunnery Sergeant?
Nope.
It's my idea of how to run an accidendeath investigation,
Special Agent...?
Gibbs.
Well, a civilian decided to trespass at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Marines didn't spot him till it was too late.
What was a civilian doing down there?
My guess, he was a scavenger.
Lot of metal and scrap iron's been dumped here over the years.
Enough to risk blowing yourself up over?
I didn't say he was smart, Agent Gibbs.
But, hey, you want NCIS to handle the paperwork on this one?
Fine.
Get down there, secure the scene.
Just make sure your people stay inside the marked areas cleared by EOD
I don't need another dead civilian on my hands.
Attractive.
I want everybody off this range except EOD personnel.
What about Mr. Potato Head?
He stays.
With luck, he'll spit on my boots.
Looking for a reason to whack him in the head, Gibbs?
No.
To shoot him.
Tony, didn't you tell methat you worked a case on a live-impact range once?
Yeah, that's right.
Fort A.P. Hill.
Tragic.
What happened?
EOD missed ordnance marking the path.
Boom!
Agent walking point, a probie, of course, blew his foot off.
You're kidding, right?
Of course I'm kidding...
Probie.
We're right behind you, buddy.
You're doing great.
Some of them are buried under the ground.
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,
I'd say our young victim was running when he was hit.
How can you tell, doctor?
Oh, I've seen far too many of these types of wounds during my tour in Vietnam.
What about the bruising on his wrists and face, Duck?
It's possible it was caused by blast concussion.
We'll know more when we get him back.
This guy was no scavenger, boss.
Salvatore Ferragamo's.
What?
Italian shoes.
Expensive.
Pair I got cost almost 500 bucks.
Well, not everybody shops at Wal-Mart.
I'm not saying you shop at Wal-Mart.
Or even that that's a bad thing.
How's it going, Kate?
Almost finished.
I've got McGee doing measurements.
What are you doing?
Following our vict prints.
They came from over there.
Well, how'd he get down here?
We're at least five miles from the nearest civilian road.
Someone dropped him off.
Hey!
That area hasn't been cleared yet.
Agent Gibbs!
Hey!
You trying to get yourself killed?
Are you deaf or nuts?
Little of both.
You still think that this was an accident, Gunny?
Jimmy, run this up to Abby for me.
Uh, sure.
Would it be okay if I stayed and chatted with her for awhile, doctor?
We're rather busy at the moment.
Okay, so you're saying that, uh... it's not okay, then?
Sorry.
Sorry.
The accent kind of throws me off sometimes.
He means well, but often I have an overwhelming urge to slap him.
Is that wrong?
Do it all the time.
So I've noticed.
But only on the back of the head.
A slap in the face would be humiliating.
Back of the head's a wake up call.
Looks like he got both.
You were right.
His facial injuries weren't from the bombs.
Our victim received a rather savage beating before his death.
And our crispy critter?
He wasn't burned by today's explosions.
Tests indicate the poor chap's been deceased east six months.
There are more bodies out there.
Yes.
I was afraid of that.
We've stumbled into a bone yard, Duck.
Yeah.
Serial killer's dumping ground.
Hey, Gunny!
Have a look.
What have we got here?
Well, that's not good.
You hear that?
Yeah, what is that?
Evac!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Well at least I get Gibbs a finger.
I heared Kate kicked your but this morning, McGee.
Oh, you heared wrong.
It wasn't my butt.
She kicked you in the...
Yeah.
I thought I was joining a Federal Agency not reliving my junior year in high school.
Just remember, they torture you because they care.
So I make them dislike me....
Never get worth.
It's what I thought.
Hey!
I just I.D.'d your body.
And he's cute.
He's dead.
I know.
He's also a major criminal.
What can I say?
I'm attracted to that bad boy type...
No way.
I'm get hacked.
A port scan?
No, no, this is major.
They've already burned to the NCIS public firewall.
Well, isolate the node and dump then the other side of the router.
I'm trying!
It's moving too fast
Oh, this is not good.
They're using our connection with AFIS database-- sever it.
I can't, It's a point attack.
He or she is only going after my machine.
It's not possible, there's DOD Level Nine encryption.
It would take months...
Hey.
What is that, a video game?
No, Tony, we're getting hacked.
If they get into Abby's computer, the entire NCIS network is next.
I can't stop him.
Do something, McGee.
I've never seen code like this.
Ah, way to go, Abby.
I didn't do anything.
I thought you did?
No.
I did.
What the hell's going on here?
We were pulling a fingerprint match from the AFIS database and we set off some kind of cyber attack.
- They were definitely waiting for us.
- Who?
I don't know, Tony, and right now
I'm afraid to turn my machine back on.
The speed they were cracking our encryption at there's only a few computers in the world with that type of power.
Name them.
Well, the... the CERN institute in Geneva, IBM's research facility, rumors of a few in China.
Oh, good, so it should be easy to find them.
Where is my match?
China.
You want some?
Thanks.
Whoever this guy is, he's got some friends in high places, Gibbs.
Victor Gera.
AKA Guido Valentino.
Career criminal.
Guido Valentino?
That's the alias he used in L.A.
Started running numbers in Chicago as a kid, moved onto jacking cars as a teen, graduated to drug dealing on the West Coast.
Six months ago, he showed up in D.C.
Mafia?
Well, with names like Vic Gera and Guido Valentino, what else?
Probie, in case you forget, my name is
Tony DiNozzo.
Italiano.
Doesn't make me, Mafia, now does it?
No.
Of course not.
I'm sorry.
Prego.
McGee, what's the connection between small-time hood and super computer?
Well, I have no idea, boss.
Ooh, wrong answer.
I'll go look for the right one now.
Why would the mob, or anyone, stash bodies at a Marine bombing range?
Because it's the last place you'd look for them.
Who'd be nuts enough to go down there looking for bodies?
Besides us?
Yeah, Gibbs.
You did what?
!
I'm on my way!
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.
He's not done screwing up my investigation.
Wow.
I thought you were the only one who could piss him off like that.
You never met his second wife.
I told you not to touch anything without my M.E. being present.
I didn't really have much of a choice.
It was near an unstable javelin round.
It'd likely kill me and another Marine when it exploded.
Here.
You have a body that goes with this?
I think it was destroyed during the explosion.
You think?
Look, EOD kicked me off the range.
That whole entire area's been declared off limits 'til it's cleared.
How long?
Gibbs, there's decades of unexploded ordnance down there.
My guess, three weeks, minimum.
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.
Gunny, you coming?
I set up a virtual model emulating my system.
He comes back again, we can dump him into it.
Won't fool him for long.
All I need is a minute to back-trace his connection.
Okay, I'm ready.
Plug me in, McGee.
Round two.
He's still there and coming on strong.
Initiating my back-trace... now.
Oh, this guy is good.
He's almost made it through your little virtual world.
Yeah, but I'm better.
Oh, got you!
Ha!
Now let's see who we're dealing with.
Oh, my God.
Gibbs is going to kill you.
Kill me?
Why?
I'm not gonna tell him.
EOD has cleared 10% of the range so far.
In this small area and in a relatively short span of time, we found three bodies.
Do the math and we could be looking at potentially 30 or more victims concealed down there.
Gunny, I want you to coordinate with the Provost Martial.
I want a cordon around that range 24 hours a day.
Agent Gibbs, that's a lot of man power.
You really think...
Well, then you'd better get moving.
Right.
Is there some secret to getting on his good side?
Oh, there's no secret.
He doesn't have one.
Uh, excuse me, boss?
What?
We completed the back-trace on the intruder's system.
Yeah?
Yeah, and, uh...
Well, the thing is...
The hacker...
It's me.
Why is NCIS interested in Vic Gera, Gibbs?
Who said we were interested in him?
You ran his prints through AFIS.
Where'd you get them?
He gave them to us.
You have him in custody?
Technically speaking.
Where'd you find him?
On a live fire range at Quantico.
He was killed in a practice bomb drop this morning.
He Mafia?
He's an undercover FBI Agent, DiNozzo.
When we saw your print search, we were hoping Vic was alive.
I want his killer, Gibbs.
Is that an offer for a joint investigation?
I can't.
Kate, Tony, escort our guests out.
I need to talk to you alone.
Our usual conference room.
What's going on?
Fornell seems unusually upset.
For an FBI Agent.
How would you feel if one of your team was lying on a slab?
Depends on who it was.
You always a smart ass?
Just to you boys from the Hoover building.
I'm listening.
Jimmy Napalitano.
Know him?
Fat, ugly Mafioso, runs the business in Maryland, Virginia and D.C.
I've spent half my career trying to put that bastard behind bars.
Three trials, three times he walked on a technicality.
Tough to be sympathetic, considering you let Ari go.
Ari's a valuable intelligence asset, Gibbs.
Napalitano's nothing but a cheap hood.
Ari shot one of my people, kidnapped one of my agents, put a round through me.
I don't see the difference, Fornell.
I knew this was a waste of time.
At least we agree on something.
Anyone ever tell you you're an insufferable bastard?
Yeah.
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here because I need your help.
I offered a joint investigation.
You turned it down.
I couldn't say anything in front of those Agents.
You don't trust them?
Napalitano's always been a step ahead of me.
Every informant, every agent I get close to him ends up like that kid downstairs.
No one's that lucky.
He's got a mole in the Bureau.
Or someone with access to my operations.
Why not take it to Internal Affairs?
They can't help me.
But I can?
Realizing how sad this sounds, you're the closest thing I have to a friend, Gibbs.
You dying or something?
Okay, not dying.
This some part of a 12-step program?
Look, you going to help me or not?
I'm thinking about it.
It's settled then.
This isn't your style, Tobias.
I know it.
The Bureau believes that the mole who put my man on your slab.... is me.
Sorry, Tobias.
Hey, Tiffany, enough with the smoking already.
Get off my back, Ricky.
I pay you to dance, not get lung cancer.
All right, already.
I thought Tiffany was your numero uno?
Nah, I dumped her.
Rickey, how do ya dump somethin' that looks like that?
It's easy.
Ba-da bing, ba-da boom.
Ciao!
I gotta remember that one.
The comedian is Napalitano's son, Little Rickey.
Who's the muscle with him?
Sal Balducci, Napalitano's enforcer.
And that's the man himself.
Jimmy Napalitano, AKA Jimmy Naps.
He's politically connected and has the finest lawyers money can buy.
He's virtually untouchable.
We got a problem.
What kind of problem, Pops?
Not here.
Inside.
You got ears inside?
No.
Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.
Camera two, get me tight on the thug by the rear entrance.
-They find our bugs and wiretaps before we finish installing them.
-Or your mole tips 'em off.
There's no mole.
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.
They study us like we study them.
Rumor has it they have dossiers on all of us.
They even know we're watching them right now.
Camera one, show me Abe.
Hello, Abe.
"Abe?"
As in Vigoda.
That's the FBI call sign for him.
Oh, yeah, it does sort of look like him.
Tom, can you get me off, for old time's sake?
Sorry, Solly.
No can do.
You two through?
Sorry.
Point is, Agent Gibbs, it's impossible to get near them.
Agent Gera did.
And he's dead.
Not much of a view.
Kind of reminds me of your basement.
It'sot dark enough.
You see the Bureau's case against me?
You know that your people won't share files with us.
What's this supposed to be?
Coffee.
I'll take your word for it.
They found two kilos of coke and 50 grand in counterfeit bills in my freezer.
I thought the coke in ice cream quarts was a nice touch.
It was an expensive one.
Jimmy Naps's going to a lot of trouble to frame youTobias...
Why now?
He knew I was vulnerable.
Vulnerable?
How?
Ari.
You laying this on me, huh?
I arranged your meeting with him, Jethro.
He's our only agent inside Al Qaeda, and what did you do?
You shot him.
I could have killed him.
Putting a round in his shoulder helped sell his cover to Al Qaeda.
Why don't you explain that to the director?
He didn't buy it when I did.
Okay.
If you think it'll do any good.
I'm not getting out of this, am I?
Ah, you'll get out of it.
It just may not be the way you like.
Duck, what do you got for me?
Ah, I've identified our second victim from the dental charts supplied by the FBI.
His name's Frank Pilato.
Frankie P.
He was to testify against Napalitano five years ago.
Disappeared walking his dog on a Sunday afternoon.
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon strolls can be dangerous.
Ducky, I thought you said the test indicated he was dead only five or six months ago.
I did.
Anyone care to guess how he died?
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say something to do with flames?
And you'd be wrong, Tony.
His throat was slit.
Bled to death.
Actually, no, Kate.
Lead poisoning.
Three nine-millimeter slugs to be exact.
Administered at close range.
He was kidnapped in '99.
And wasn't shot until a few months ago?
He was most likely executed years ago;
His body has only recently been exposed to the elements.
Excuse me.
His blood was drained after death... and his body frozen.
Jimmy Naps' version of the ice man.
They stashed the body in a cooler somewhere and then dump it years later when everyone's stopped looking.
Yeesh.
Shot, throat slit, frozen and burned?
Jimmy Naps definitely didn't like this dude.
The Mafia does tend to have a flair for the dramatic, Tony.
Anything on the finger parts Gunny De Luca picked up on the range?
I'm good, Jethro, but not that good.
I sent them up to Abby.
Kate, Tony.
On it, boss.
Agent Charles, can you get me the Bureau file on Fornell?
I haven't even seen it.
I get caught, I'm finished as a Federal Agent.
Don't get caught.
You know what I think, McGee?
What?
I think you're more interested in me than what I'm doing.
That's not true.
Wait, not that I-I'm not interested...
in you.
I am.
But I'm more interested in the work.
How could you say that?
Because what I'm looking at through the microscope...
Yeah?
...is up there on that screen.
Hey, guys!
You here for the finger or the blood?
What blood?
I found two types on Agent Gera's face.
One is his.
One is not.
So if he was beaten, you know, kind of like the way you were yesterday by Gibbs, it could be the killer's.
Kate, Kate, Kate, when I let Gibbs win, we all win.
And if I beat the crap out of him, who do you think he's going to take it out on?
Oh, that's right, all of us.
So you took a dive for the team?
Of course, McGee.
It's good to know.
It sure is.
Turn around.
I'm waiting for you to slap the back of my head, boss.
I'm not going to slap your head.
You're not?
What, you don't think I have a sense of humor?
Abbs, I need the DNA on the unknown blood.
I already started it.
Okay, what about the finger?
Any idea how long it was it on the range?
Well, ordinarily, you can't date bone unless it's been in the ground long enough to soak up fluorine.
Which is, like, hundreds of years.
But sometimes being in a place where things get blown up is a good thing.
I swabbed the finger for explosives and I found traces of one:
mercury fulminate, which was completely phased out by the military by 1986.
Well, that means the Mafia must have been dumping bodies down there for...
At least 18 years.
Thank you, McGee.
That's a good job, Abbs.
McGee, find a way to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Okay.
It's no fun if you know it's coming.
What was that for?
!
That's for eating my sandwich.
I know how to get Little Rickey's DNA.
Gonna sleep with him?
He was hit with two paternity suits in the last five years.
Beat them both with a DNA test.
Nice try, Probie, but those tests are sealed court records.
Those court records are sealed, McGee.
Hey, that's what I just said-- first!
But not the records from the lab that he used.
It's downtown.
You'll never get a judge to sign off on that warrant.
Maybe we don't need one.
That is, if you're ready to become a father.
I think she's talking to you, Probie.
We go down to the lab and see if I'm carrying your baby.
It'll be fun.
Oh, and we can steal Little Rickey's DNA test.
Photograph it for Abby.
I'll do it.
Why you?
You think anyone'd believe you actually slept with Kate?
Hey!
I figured out how to get Little Rickey's DNA records.
You mean I fig...
Hey, there is no 'I'in "team", McGee.
How?
Paternity clinic downtown.
Kate and I can have them in an hour.
Go get 'em.
Thank you, sir.
McGee.
I got the file on Fornell.
Good.
Not good.
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps was under surveillance.
He can explain this.
That photo came from an anonymous source.
From the newspaper blowup you can see the date.
The 17th?
Tobias had me pull surveillance on the 17th.
Why?
Never said.
But it's the day before Agent Gera disappeared.
He didn't hang himself, not Fornell.
That's the coward's way out and Tobias was no coward.
Only one person was in this cell with him today.
Who?
Me.
To cut him down.
Doctor...
I would like our M.E.,
Dr. Mallard, to receive a copy of your autopsy report.
Ducky?
Of course.
You writing my name right?
What?
!
I just want to know if it's mine.
She kind of sleeps around a lot, if you know what I mean.
If I did, it's 'cause he ain't any good in bed.
Least I didn't sleep with my cousin.
You slept with my sister.
I thought it was you.
She weighs 300 pounds.
She was wearing your earrings.
Now that's enough.
If you two can't be civil I'm going to have to ask you leave.
Look, is there anywhere that I can wait away from him, please?
I'm begging you.
There's an empty exam room behind you two doors on the right.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
She slept with my brother... and my best friend at the same time.
Okay, we've got Rickey's DNA from the clinic.
Let's see if we can match it to our sample from the crime scene.
We're cued up.
Initiating DNA match.
That's it, it's Rickey Napalitano's blood.
Thanks, Abs.
We made a good couple, Kate.
For The Jerry Springer Show.
Dig your threads.
You got to be kidding me?
Un-freaking-believable, he whacked himself.
Yeah, poor Fornell.
You won't see him no more, Pops.
What the...?
This guy's pulling us over, boss.
If I find out we got a busted taillight or something, Sallie boy, it's your ass.
Is there a problem, officer?
You're talking to the wrong person.
We got a warrant for your arrest, Little Dickey.
It's Rickey.
It's for murder, Dickey.
Come on.
Get out.
All right.
Hands on the hood, big guy.
Hand up.
Who the hell are you guys anyway, FBI?
NCIS.
Meat inspectors?
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?
They're Navy cops.
Turn around.
Arrested by Navy cops?
Talk about embarrassing.
At least you're hot, sweet...
Take it easy, take it easy.
Now that's embarrassing.
Let's go.
All right, don't worry.
Go with them, Rickey.
Our lawyers'll take care of this.
I don't think we've met, Agent...
Special Agent.
Gibbs.
Special Agent Gibbs.
So who is it my son was supposed to have whacked?
An FBI Agent.
Victor Gera.
I remember something about that.
Something happened on a marine base?
What was that?
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.
A bomb.
Yeah, yeah.
Suppose-
- God forbid-- that my son could be connected to this accident, what would you charge him with,
Special Agent Gibbs?
Manslaughter.
Manslaughter?
Manslaughter, what's the worst you can get with that, Sallie?
Four years.
Does one.
Might do the kid some good, season him up a bit.
Jail can be a dangerous place.
So they tell me.
You remind me of somebody, Special Agent Gibbs.
Who was that guy that always talking trash, that Fed?
Fornell?
Oh, yeah, Fornell.
That's it, yeah.
Whatever happened to him?
I think he hung himself.
Real sad.
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.
All that ambition and everything and he ends up doing the twist.
I get the government agent on your payroll by sunup, dirt bag... or Little Rickey does the twist.
Say I do this, all right?
What do I get?
I deliver Little Rickey to you, the evidence against him gets lost, and you never see me again.
You'd do all this just to clear Fornell's name?
He was my friend.
You can't threaten to kill someone in custody, Gibbs.
It wasn't a threat.
You'd really do it?
Hey.
You want to clear Tobias's name?
Hell, yes.
But not by letting Little Rickey off for Vic's murder.
Oh, he'll screw up again.
You think Jimmy Naps is going to make a swap and just let you walk away?
I hope not.
Gibbs.
Rear of the club.
One hour.
Lose the Feds in the building and in the alley.
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm operating on my own hook.
Pick another place.
You want me to pick a place?
I'm trying to show you there are no tricks here, Jimmy boy.
Coleman Park.
You know it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it.
Come alone.
I'm not that stupid.
All right, we each bring a man.
One hour.
And, Gibbs... you hurt my boy,
I'll kill your brothers, your uncles, your father...
and after their funerals, I'll kill you.
No brothers, no uncles.
My father passed years ago.
I do have three ex-wives whose names and addresses
I will gladly fax on to you.
Oh.
He hung up.
Whoa.
Where do you three think you're going?
With you, boss.
I can bring one back up.
Clearly you should take me.
Kate, with all due respect...
Are you kidding, Tony, why should he bring you?
With all due respect, you have no idea...
You're a total jackass.
Come on, you can conduct yourself in the field?
Agent Charles is going.
Me?
Are you kidding, boss?
He's kidding, right?
I don't think he is, Tony.
Gibbs, you need someone...
Someone who can verify the guy that Jimmy Naps turns over is FBI or Justice.
Can any of you do that?
He's right.
I know the players.
I go.
These bracelets are killing me.
You hear me?
Stay there, Sallie.
Stay, stay.
Where's my boy?
Where's Rickey?
Pops.
Hey.
You okay, son?
No.
Make them take these freaking bracelets off me.
Where's your end of the swap?
I leave my backup at the car, u do the same.
Sallie, bring him out.
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Chop-chop, let's go.
We ain't got all day.
That's Abe.
Stupido.
Pop, I had nothing to do...
Not you, not you.
This jabone.
What'd you think I was gonna do, let you come in my backyard and walk away with your coglioni?
You know what Primacord is, Jimmy?
Primacord?
That was Primacord.
This... is Primacord.
Oh!
Oh!
Pops!
And this is a dead-man's switch.
Oh, marone.
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.
All you have to do is give me your mole's name.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
You dumb Wop.
He never would've set it off.
The blast would kill him.
Who you gonna believe?
He's pazzo, Pop.
He'll do it.
He'll do it.
In fact, I think the blast should kill all of you.
You should've kept your mouth shut, Napalitano.
You lied to me, Jimmy.
Like you didn't expect it.
I just saved all our lives.
Now what?
Ciao.
Pops.
Pops!
You go to jail, you stay there a couple of years, it'll do you good, son.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, let's go.
Get this thing off me.
Here.
Do it yourself.
Boom.
What you doing there, Probie?
I'm trying to find what I missed.
How did Gibbs know that it was Charles?
You mean you didn't know?
He didn't know.
What, you knew?
We're seasoned investigators, McGee.
You have to start thinking outside the box.
Expect the unexpected.
Good advice, Tony.
Agent Todd.
DiNozzo.
McGee.
What?
Previously on Will Grace
Lyle Finster and I are back together!
Really?
Didn't you guys break up?
'Cause the last time we saw the two of you, you were taking advantage of him to get back at his daughter, Lorraine.
Meanwhile, you developed real feelings for him in the process, but he no longer cared.
He's back, he's moved in, and we're shagging like two lieutenants after lights out.
Oh, darling, promise me it will always be this way.
I wouldn't count on it.
I was kicked out of my place, so I'm moving in here.
Hello, mother!
Oh, well, Grace and I are looking to buy a property to flip.
we'll buy for a fair price.
We'll invest our time and our creativity, and we'll flip for an honest profit.
That's right.
We're the flippers who care.
So, are you thinking about selling your old place?
What's it to you, chimp?
I have the perfect buyers!
This is Will and Grace.
They're my best friends.
Her husband abandoned her.
His never existed.
The place looks amazing.
And we are gonna make a fortune!
You know what?
I want my home back!
come on, give her the place back!
No!
I'm sorry, but she sold it to us.
I want us to live together.
I want to buy this place and make it our home.
For reals?
!
What about Zandra.
You said that she hated the Actors' Retirement Village.
Oh, screw her.
She got in with the Gabor clique, she's fine.
I'm a bride!
Will Grace 6x16 "Flip-Flop part 2"
Would you look at that great big, beautiful city.
You know, they say there's a crime committed here every six seconds.
Should we wait?
Okay.
Oh, my God.
There it is.
Wow, three seconds.
Way ahead.
Helloooo!
Oh, hey, Will!
I love when you add "O"s onto your hellos.
It's, like, my favorite thing you do.
Yeah, its true.
We talk about it all the time.
Really?
Oh, that's good.
I-I-I was toying with getting rid of it, but now I know it has a following....
I just came by to drop off this paperwork.
You are now...
Oh, isn't that great?
Do you remember when gay people weren't allowed to be in escrow?
And, to celebrate, little pre-housewarming gift, the Whirlybird popcorn maker.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I didn't, I had two of them.
I just thought it'd be a good gift for all those nights you guys'll be hanging out here at home, renting movies, eating popcorn.
Oooh, I know.
I can hardly wait.
Soon as I've washed my hands 17 times, I'm gonna take it out of the box.
I envy you two.
Not having to go to the clubs.
Not having that moment at the end of the night where you look around during last call, and everybody's paired up except for you and one trollish-looking guy.
You figure, what the heck, and you go over to him, and he says no.
That--that happened to a friend of mine.
Yeah.
Happened to a friend of mine too...
Well, anyway, I gotta get going.
Why-why don't you, uh, sit with us for a bit?
Hang out.
It'll be fun.
Oh, okay.
Well, that was fun.
See ya!
Hey, thanks a lot.
What?
Why are you smiling?
Did he fart?
I was just thinking about what Will said.
You know, he's right.
Well, of course he's right.
What self-respecting troll would go home with Will at the end of the night?
No, no, not about that.
About us.
About how lucky we are.
I mean, we are set.
There's nothing left for us to do except sit back and grow old together.
I don't know about you, but this girl ain't growing' old.
No, that's why I take care of myself.
I eat right, I exercise, and I take a multivitamin to avoid iron-poor blood like Evonne Goolagong.
You don't have to worry about that anymore.
You got the guy, give up the gym.
Yeah, but I've been doing cardio ever since I was nine.
now you don't have to anymore.
You can finally stop running.
Darling, are we being robbed?
Can you see who it is?
No, it's too dark.
You stay there, Karen.
I'm pretty good with this thing.
You don't have to tell me about that.
Oh, shoot.
I thought it was someone trying to kill us.
What are you doing?
You scared me half to death.
Well, what are you doing?
I mean, it's the middle of the night.
I know that.
I'm drunk, not stupid.
Now, keep it down.
I've had a very rough night.
I had to walk 140 blocks back from the Yankee Stadium after I lost your limo.
You lost my limo?
Oh, relax.
I didn't misplace it.
I lost it in a bet.
I mean, who knew Hideki Matsui could hit a baseball further than me?
Finny, are you hearing this?
It's one thing that she doesn't clean her room, but now she's lost our limo to the Asian Willie Mays.
Lorraine, this time you have gone too far.
Daddy gonna crack the whip.
It's all right.
I'll handle this, thank you.
Now, look, you are disrespectful.
And you are irresponsible.
And you need to learn that your actions have consequences.
Okay?
So-
- You are going to pay for Karen's limo out of your own money.
Or try winning it back using this house as collateral.
Like hell I will.
You'll do as I say, and you'll like it, young lady!
I rather like this, Karen.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's too late for you to be a father.
You don't care about me, and you never did.
I'm gonna go and get a place of my own.
You're never gonna see me again!
I thought you were cool!
Boy, you really showed her.
Felt good, huh?
Oh, I--I've made a horrible mistake.
What?
Well, I was finally building a relationship with her, doing all the things that I never got the chance to do before.
Like the other day when she fell down and skinned her knee, I was there to kiss her boo-boo.
Of course, I may now have hepatitis, but it--it brought us closer.
Now she's gone, and I've ruined my liver for nothing.
Are you implying that it's my fault that she left?
Of course it's your fault!
You can't stand me getting closer to her.
You're always driving a wedge between her and me.
And that's been your plan all along!
No, Darling.
I've been like a mother to that girl.
I've locked her in her room, I've told her she was fat, and once I even left her in a store.
Well, let me tell you something.
Last time I chose you.
This time, I'm choosing my daughter.
But Finny, no...
Good-bye, Karen.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, thank God you're home.
You will not believe what just happened.
You washed a dish?
I got a call on Zandra's place.
Someone offered the most insane amount of money.
How insane?
If the money were a person, it'd be Courtney Love.
Did--did you tell them that the place was already sold?
No, I said that I would talk to you about it.
Grace, we can't.
We're in escrow.
Oh, escrow.
What is escrow?
You know what it is.
They've already put up the money.
I thought it was something else.
What's "force majeure"?
Grace, the place is sold, okay?
Stuart bought it.
Besides, we're the flippers who care, remember?
That's our motto.
Read your coffee cup.
Why do you think I had these made?
You know, if we start screwing our friends over, we can never drink from these mugs again.
You're right.
You're right, I--I think I just got caught up in all that money.
Just out of curiosity, how insane was that offer?
Oh, my God!
That's Courtney Love and Margot Kidder!
On a hike with Anne Heche!
No, no, no, it's-
- Yes, it's a lot of money, but we--
You cannot put a price on integrity, right?
I don't think Stuart and I should live together.
I never thought you should!
And you know, it's not too late to get out of escrow.
Do you want to know why?
Not really.
I mean, I-I'm sure you've thought about it.
You're a smart guy.
Listen, is Stuart still in the apartment?
'Cause we could undo this thing right now.
Will?
I think we should hear him out.
No.
Grace, he's made up his mind.
He doesn't want to take the apartment.
We're not gonna-- not gonna force majeure 'im.
Hey, I don't know what happened.
I was there with Stuart in that apartment, and he was talking.
And all of a sudden, we were old.
There were cats, and housecoats, and CBS.
And keeping tissues up our sleeves.
I don't think I'm ready to be an old married lady.
Does somebody have a shawl?
It's really chilly in here.
Jack, everyone gets nervous when they move in with someone.
It's totally normal.
Like me.
When I moved in with Leo, I was really nervous.
And you know what?
Never shoulda done it.
You're right.
We're moving too quickly.
I'm gonna go talk to Stuart.
I hope this doesn't affect our friendship if we back out of the deal.
Oh, how would you even ask?
Oh, no.
Okay, thanks, you guys, bye.
Whoo hoo!
Let's get him on the phone.
Money-money-money-money...
Money!
I guess on the beach towels, we should change it to "Flippers Who Don't Give A Crap."
Oh, Rosie, I miss Lyle so much.
Or do you just miss the idea of Lyle?
No, I miss Lyle.
But hey, good insight, lady.
Well, in El Salvador, I was three credits short a Masters in Psychology.
Well, I'm glad you came here to mop up my sick off the floor instead.
Hey, Karen, get in.
Why should I?
I got your limo.
I won it back from Hideki Matsui in a secret underground Iron Chef contest.
Come on, get in.
all right
But only because I've been walking for blocks, and my feet are killing me.
Oy, me too.
Not you, Rosie.
So, what are you doing here, Lorraine?
You've taken your father away from me, and now you've come to rub it in my face?
I haven't come to run anything in anyone's face.
I already tipped the driver.
No, I just came to apologize.
I was awful.
Hey, hey.
Wait a minute.
When we are in my limo, we listen to Soft Hits 106.
Continue.
Well...
I guess I was just scared.
You know, I just found my dad.
And--and it felt like you were taking him away from me.
well, you won.
He's all yours.
What do you mean?
All he talks about is you.
He does?
Well, where do you think I'm taking you, you gin-soaked old crone?
Lorraine, why are you being so nice to me?
Oh, because I hate this.
You're sad, he's sad.
Nobody's any bloody fun anymore.
Well, to tell the truth, it hasn't been as much fun around the manse either, without you there.
if only I could put into words how I feel.
I love this song.
A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there...
But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home...
When there's no one there to hold you tight, and no one there you can kiss good night.
I'm glad we didn't invite Rosie.
I knew as soon as you said that to Jack, you were doing the wrong thing.
I was just helpless to stop you.
You jumped onboard.
You made the final sale.
You hypnotized me with your Svengali-like powers.
And yet I can't get you to stop biting your toenails.
How else do you get them shorter?
Hellloooo.
I'm glad you guys are both here.
Yeah, we have something that we need to tell you.
We did an awful thing.
We really did.
The reason we said you shouldn't live together is that we got another offer on this place for a lot more money.
And it was just really wrong of us.
The truth is, you guys are a great couple.
And nothing would make us happier than to see you two set up house together.
It really would.
Why did you point on that one?
It seems the shoe is on the other foot now, doesn't it?
I don't know what you mean exactly.
I think I might have put my Uggs on backwards.
The difference between the toes is really subtle.
I think what Jack's saying is that we were starting to feel little uncomfortable about moving in together so quickly.
It seemed kind of lesbian of us to fall in love and shack up right away.
Yeah, so, if you don't mind, I don't think we're gonna take the place.
I guess--I guess you can take that other offer now.
that's the furthest thing from our mind right now.
Our biggest concern is your happiness.
So, see ya.
Hurry up, call them.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Are you kindding?
I was dialing in my pocket as he was talking.
Hi, hi, it's Will Truman.
Right, listen, I've got some great news for you, uh, if you're still looking for an apartment.
Money, money, money, money...
Oh, you did?
No, that--that--no, that's okay.
I--I understand.
Money?
They bought another place.
You know what?
Maybe we deserve this.
Maybe this happened because we are supposed to learn a lesson.
Maybe the flippers who care are supposed to care a little more.
What are we gonna do with this apartment?
Anyway, Zandra, we're-- we're really sorry we tried to kick you out of your home.
And all we're asking for is-- is what we put into the place.
That's very fair of you, Homo.
I'm so glad to be out of the Actors' Retirement Village.
Finally I can take a tub without Charlotte Rae staring at me.
those-
- Those are some Facts of Life I could've done without knowing.
The--what?
The--the place fell through?
Well, no, no, of course it's still available.
Zandra, your bag's still in the hallway, right?
Now, look, as we're playing for money, I should warn you, I'm extremely good at this.
Anyone else you'd like me to hit?
Another drink please, barman.
Hello, sailor.
Look, I've only got a hundred dollars--
Karen?
Hi, Dad.
What are you doing here?
I want us to be together.
And I know you want it too.
But I--I don't see how it's possible.
I mean, I can't have the two women that I love most in the world going at it like Italians.
Well, don't say it like that.
It makes us sound so garlicky.
But... we've been doing some thinking.
And we've realized that... the reason we fight so much isn't because we're different.
It's because we're the same.
That's right.
We're both money-grubbing, sex-starved women who are ofttimes mistaken for transvestites.
And if that's not reason enough to build a relationship, I don't know what is.
Look,
I can't guarantee that we won't fight.
But we're two women who love you, and want you to be happy.
Is that such a bad thing?
No, I suppose not.
Three women would be better, but two's a start.
I'm gonna leave you two alone.
I'm gonna head back to my seedy little hotel room, which ironically was quite nice before I moved in.
No, Lorraine, wait.
Come back to the manse.
Stay as long as you want.
Really?
Thanks.
How 'bout you, stretch?
You coming too?
Oh, well, it doesn't seem proper, the three of us living together without benefit of marriage.
Did I just hear a proposal?
No, but now you've made it awkward.
Good heavens, I wanted to marry you the first time I set eyes on you.
Karen, before God, before these toothless whores and aging alcoholics, before my daughter, I proclaim my love.
Will you marry me?
Of course I will, Lyle.
That is how you pronounce it, right?
Yeah, Lyle, yeah.
Oh, this is so exciting!
Finally, the old man's getting married.
And congratulations to you too, Dad.
Previously on Will Grace...
Lyle Finster and I are back together!
Really?
Didn't you guys break up?
'Cause the last time we saw the two of you, you were taking advantage of him to get back at his daughter, Lorraine.
Meanwhile, you developed real feelings for him in the process, but he no longer cared.
He's back, he's moved in, and we're shagging like two lieutenants after lights out.
Oh, darling, promise me it will always be this way.
I wouldn't count on it.
I was kicked out of my place, so I'm moving in here.
Hello, mother!
Oh, Grace and I are looking to buy a property to flip.
You know, we'll buy for a fair price.
We'll invest our time and our creativity, and we'll flip for an honest profit.
That's right.
We're the flippers who care.
So, are you thinking about selling your old place?
What's it to you, chimp?
I have the perfect buyers!
This is Will and Grace.
They're my best friends.
Her husband abandoned her.
His never existed.
The place looks amazing.
And we are gonna make a fortune!
You know what?
I want my home back!
Come on, give her the place back!
No!
I'm sorry, but she sold it to us.
I want us to live together.
I want to buy this place and make it our home.
- For reals?
- What about Zandra.
You said that she hated the Actors' Retirement Village.
Oh, screw her.
She got in with the Gabor clique, she's fine.
I'm a bride!
Will Grace Saison 6
- Episode 16
Flip Flop (Part 2)
Would you look at that great big, beautiful city.
You know, they say there's a crime committed here every six seconds.
Should we wait?
- Oh, my God.
There it is.
- Wow, three seconds.
Way ahead.
Helloooo!
Oh, hey, Will!
I love when you add "O"s onto your hellos.
It's, like, my favorite thing you do.
Yeah, its true.
We talk about it all the time.
Really?
Oh, that's good.
I was toying with getting rid of it, but now I know it has a following...
I just came by to drop off this paperwork.
You are now officially in escrow.
Oh, isn't that great?
Do you remember when gay people weren't allowed to be in escrow?
And, to celebrate, little pre-housewarming gift, the Whirlybird popcorn maker.
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- I didn't, I had two of them.
I just thought it'd be a good gift for all those nights you guys'll be hanging out here at home, renting movies, eating popcorn.
Oooh, I know.
I can hardly wait.
Soon as I've washed my hands 17 times,
I'm gonna take it out of the box.
I envy you two.
Not having to go to the clubs.
Not having that moment at the end of the night where you look around during last call, and everybody's paired up except for you and one trollish-looking guy.
You figure, what the heck, and you go over to him, and he says no.
That happened to a friend of mine.
Yeah.
Happened to a friend of mine too...
Well, anyway, I gotta get going.
Why don't you, uh, sit with us for a bit?
Hang out.
It'll be fun.
Well, that was fun.
See ya!
Hey, thanks a lot.
What?
Why are you smiling?
Did he fart?
I was just thinking about what Will said.
You know, he's right.
Well, of course he's right.
What self-respecting troll would go home with Will at the end of the night?
No, no, not about that.
About us.
About how lucky we are.
I mean, we are set.
There's nothing left for us to do except sit back and grow old together.
I don't know about you, but this girl ain't growing' old.
No, that's why I take care of myself.
I eat right, I exercise, and I take a multivitamin to avoid iron-poor blood like Evonne Goolagong.
You don't have to worry about that anymore.
You got the guy, give up the gym.
Yeah, but I've been doing cardio ever since I was nine.
Now you don't have to anymore.
You can finally stop running.
Darling, are we being robbed?
Can you see who it is?
No, it's too dark.
You stay there, Karen.
I'm pretty good with this thing.
You don't have to tell me about that.
Oh, shoot.
I thought it was someone trying to kill us.
What are you doing?
You scared me half to death.
Well, what are you doing?
I mean, it's the middle of the night.
I know that.
I'm drunk, not stupid.
Now, keep it down.
I've had a very rough night.
I had to walk 140 blocks back from the Yankee Stadium after I lost your limo.
You lost my limo?
Oh, relax.
I didn't misplace it.
I lost it in a bet.
I mean, who knew Hideki Matsui could hit a baseball further than me?
Finny, are you hearing this?
It's one thing that she doesn't clean her room, but now she's lost our limo to the Asian Willie Mays.
Lorraine, this time you have gone too far.
Daddy gonna crack the whip.
It's all right.
Thank you, Dear.
I'll handle this, thank you.
Now, look, you are disrespectful.
And you are irresponsible.
And you need to learn that your actions have consequences.
Okay?
So...
You are going to pay for Karen's limo out of your own money.
Or try winning it back using this house as collateral.
Like hell I will.
You'll do as I say, and you'll like it, young lady!
I rather like this, Karen.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's too late for you to be a father.
You don't care about me, and you never did.
I'm gonna go and get a place of my own.
You're never gonna see me again!
I thought you were cool!
Boy, you really showed her.
Felt good, huh?
Oh, I've made a horrible mistake.
What?
Well, I was finally building a relationship with her, doing all the things that I never got the chance to do before.
Like the other day when she fell down and skinned her knee,
I was there to kiss her boo-boo.
Of course, I may now have hepatitis, but it brought us closer.
Now she's gone, and I've ruined my liver for nothing.
Are you implying that it's my fault that she left?
Of course it's your fault!
You can't stand me getting closer to her.
You're always driving a wedge between her and me.
And that's been your plan all along!

Oh, you shouldn't have.
I didn't, I had two of them.
I just thought it'd be a good gift for all those nights you guys'll be hanging out here at home, renting movies, eating popcorn.
Oooh, I know.
I can hardly wait.
Soon as I've washed my hands 17 times, I'm gonna take it out of the box.
I envy you two.
Not having to go to the clubs.
Not having that moment at the end of the night where you look around during last call, and everybody's paired up except for you and one trollish-looking guy.
You figure, what the heck, and you go over to him, and he says no.
That--that happened to a friend of mine.
Yeah.
Happened to a friend of mine too...
Well, anyway, I gotta get going.
Why-why don't you, uh, sit with us for a bit?
Hang out.
It'll be fun.
Oh, okay.
Well, that was fun.
See ya!
Hey, thanks a lot.
What?
Why are you smiling?
Did he fart?
I was just thinking about what Will said.
You know, he's right.
Well, of course he's right.
What self-respecting troll would go home with Will at the end of the night?
No, no, not about that.
About us.
About how lucky we are.
I mean, we are set.
There's nothing left for us to do except sit back and grow old together.
I don't know about you, but this girl ain't growing' old.
No, that's why I take care of myself.
I eat right, I exercise, and I take a multivitamin to avoid iron-poor blood like Evonne Goolagong.
You don't have to worry about that anymore.
You got the guy, give up the gym.
Yeah, but I've been doing cardio ever since I was nine.
now you don't have to anymore.
You can finally stop running.
Darling, are we being robbed?
Can you see who it is?
No, it's too dark.
You stay there, Karen.
I'm pretty good with this thing.
You don't have to tell me about that.
Oh, shoot.
I thought it was someone trying to kill us.
What are you doing?
You scared me half to death.
Well, what are you doing?
I mean, it's the middle of the night.
I know that.
I'm drunk, not stupid.
Now, keep it down.
I've had a very rough night.
I had to walk 140 blocks back from the Yankee Stadium after I lost your limo.
You lost my limo?
Oh, relax.
I didn't misplace it.
I lost it in a bet.
I mean, who knew Hideki Matsui could hit a baseball further than me?
Finny, are you hearing this?
It's one thing that she doesn't clean her room, but now she's lost our limo to the Asian Willie Mays.
Lorraine, this time you have gone too far.
Daddy gonna crack the whip.
It's all right.
I'll handle this, thank you.
Now, look, you are disrespectful.
And you are irresponsible.
And you need to learn that your actions have consequences.
Okay?
So-
- You are going to pay for Karen's limo out of your own money.
Or try winning it back using this house as collateral.
Like hell I will.
You'll do as I say, and you'll like it, young lady!
I rather like this, Karen.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's too late for you to be a father.
You don't care about me, and you never did.
I'm gonna go and get a place of my own.
You're never gonna see me again!
I thought you were cool!
Boy, you really showed her.
Felt good, huh?
Oh, I--I've made a horrible mistake.
What?
Well, I was finally building a relationship with her, doing all the things that I never got the chance to do before.
Like the other day when she fell down and skinned her knee, I was there to kiss her boo-boo.
Of course, I may now have hepatitis, but it--it brought us closer.
Now she's gone, and I've ruined my liver for nothing.
Are you implying that it's my fault that she left?
Of course it's your fault!
You can't stand me getting closer to her.
You're always driving a wedge between her and me.
And that's been your plan all along!
No, Darling.
I've been like a mother to that girl.
I've locked her in her room, I've told her she was fat, and once I even left her in a store.
Well, let me tell you something.
Last time I chose you.
This time, I'm choosing my daughter.
But Finny, no...
Good-bye, Karen.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, thank God you're home.
You will not believe what just happened.
You washed a dish?
I got a call on Zandra's place.
Someone offered the most insane amount of money.
How insane?
If the money were a person, it'd be Courtney Love.
Did--did you tell them that the place was already sold?
No, I said that I would talk to you about it.
Grace, we can't.
We're in escrow.
Oh, escrow.
What is escrow?
You know what it is.
They've already put up the money.
I thought it was something else.
What's "force majeure"?
Grace, the place is sold, okay?
Stuart bought it.
Besides, we're the flippers who care, remember?
That's our motto.
Read your coffee cup.
Why do you think I had these made?
You know, if we start screwing our friends over, we can never drink from these mugs again.
You're right.
You're right, I--I think I just got caught up in all that money.
Just out of curiosity, how insane was that offer?
Oh, my God!
That's Courtney Love and Margot Kidder!
On a hike with Anne Heche!
No, no, no, it's-
- Yes, it's a lot of money, but we--
You cannot put a price on integrity, right?
I don't think Stuart and I should live together.
I never thought you should!
And you know, it's not too late to get out of escrow.
Do you want to know why?
Not really.
I mean, I-I'm sure you've thought about it.
You're a smart guy.
Listen, is Stuart still in the apartment?
'Cause we could undo this thing right now.
Will?
I think we should hear him out.
No.
Grace, he's made up his mind.
He doesn't want to take the apartment.
We're not gonna-- not gonna force majeure 'im.
Hey, I don't know what happened.
I was there with Stuart in that apartment, and he was talking.
And all of a sudden, we were old.
There were cats, and housecoats, and CBS.
And keeping tissues up our sleeves.
I don't think I'm ready to be an old married lady.
Does somebody have a shawl?
It's really chilly in here.
Jack, everyone gets nervous when they move in with someone.
It's totally normal.
Like me.
When I moved in with Leo, I was really nervous.
And you know what?
Never shoulda done it.
You're right.
We're moving too quickly.
I'm gonna go talk to Stuart.
I hope this doesn't affect our friendship if we back out of the deal.
Oh, how would you even ask?
Oh, no.
Okay, thanks, you guys, bye.
Whoo hoo!
Let's get him on the phone.
Money-money-money-money...
Money!
I guess on the beach towels, we should change it to "Flippers Who Don't Give A Crap."
Oh, Rosie, I miss Lyle so much.
Or do you just miss the idea of Lyle?
No, I miss Lyle.
But hey, good insight, lady.
Well, in El Salvador, I was three credits short a Masters in Psychology.
Well, I'm glad you came here to mop up my sick off the floor instead.
Hey, Karen, get in.
Why should I?
I got your limo.
I won it back from Hideki Matsui in a secret underground Iron Chef contest.
Come on, get in.
all right
But only because I've been walking for blocks, and my feet are killing me.
Oy, me too.
Not you, Rosie.
So, what are you doing here, Lorraine?
You've taken your father away from me, and now you've come to rub it in my face?
I haven't come to run anything in anyone's face.
I already tipped the driver.
No, I just came to apologize.
I was awful.
Hey, hey.
Wait a minute.
When we are in my limo, we listen to Soft Hits 106.
Continue.
Well...
I guess I was just scared.
You know, I just found my dad.
And--and it felt like you were taking him away from me.
well, you won.
He's all yours.
What do you mean?
All he talks about is you.
He does?
Well, where do you think I'm taking you, you gin-soaked old crone?
Lorraine, why are you being so nice to me?
Oh, because I hate this.
You're sad, he's sad.
Nobody's any bloody fun anymore.
Well, to tell the truth, it hasn't been as much fun around the manse either, without you there.
if only I could put into words how I feel.
I love this song.
A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there...
But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home...
When there's no one there to hold you tight, and no one there you can kiss good night.
I'm glad we didn't invite Rosie.
I knew as soon as you said that to Jack, you were doing the wrong thing.
I was just helpless to stop you.
You jumped onboard.
You made the final sale.
You hypnotized me with your Svengali-like powers.
And yet I can't get you to stop biting your toenails.
How else do you get them shorter?
Hellloooo.
I'm glad you guys are both here.
Yeah, we have something that we need to tell you.
We did an awful thing.
We really did.
The reason we said you shouldn't live together is that we got another offer on this place for a lot more money.
And it was just really wrong of us.
The truth is, you guys are a great couple.
And nothing would make us happier than to see you two set up house together.
It really would.
Why did you point on that one?
It seems the shoe is on the other foot now, doesn't it?
I don't know what you mean exactly.
I think I might have put my Uggs on backwards.
The difference between the toes is really subtle.
I think what Jack's saying is that we were starting to feel little uncomfortable about moving in together so quickly.
It seemed kind of lesbian of us to fall in love and shack up right away.
Yeah, so, if you don't mind, I don't think we're gonna take the place.
I guess--I guess you can take that other offer now.
that's the furthest thing from our mind right now.
Our biggest concern is your happiness.
So, see ya.
Hurry up, call them.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Are you kindding?
I was dialing in my pocket as he was talking.
Hi, hi, it's Will Truman.
Right, listen, I've got some great news for you, uh, if you're still looking for an apartment.
Money, money, money, money...
Oh, you did?
No, that--that--no, that's okay.
I--I understand.
Money?
They bought another place.
You know what?
Maybe we deserve this.
Maybe this happened because we are supposed to learn a lesson.
Maybe the flippers who care are supposed to care a little more.
What are we gonna do with this apartment?
Anyway, Zandra, we're-- we're really sorry we tried to kick you out of your home.
And all we're asking for is-- is what we put into the place.
That's very fair of you, Homo.
I'm so glad to be out of the Actors' Retirement Village.
Finally I can take a tub without Charlotte Rae staring at me.
those-
- Those are some Facts of Life I could've done without knowing.
The--what?
The--the place fell through?
Well, no, no, of course it's still available.
Zandra, your bag's still in the hallway, right?
Now, look, as we're playing for money, I should warn you, I'm extremely good at this.
Anyone else you'd like me to hit?
Another drink please, barman.
Hello, sailor.
Look, I've only got a hundred dollars--
Karen?
Hi, Dad.
What are you doing here?
I want us to be together.
And I know you want it too.
But I--I don't see how it's possible.
I mean, I can't have the two women that I love most in the world going at it like Italians.
Well, don't say it like that.
It makes us sound so garlicky.
But... we've been doing some thinking.
And we've realized that... the reason we fight so much isn't because we're different.
It's because we're the same.
That's right.
We're both money-grubbing, sex-starved women who are ofttimes mistaken for transvestites.
And if that's not reason enough to build a relationship, I don't know what is.
Look,
I can't guarantee that we won't fight.
But we're two women who love you, and want you to be happy.
Is that such a bad thing?
No, I suppose not.
Three women would be better, but two's a start.
I'm gonna leave you two alone.
I'm gonna head back to my seedy little hotel room, which ironically was quite nice before I moved in.
No, Lorraine, wait.
Come back to the manse.
Stay as long as you want.
Really?
Thanks.
How 'bout you, stretch?
You coming too?
Oh, well, it doesn't seem proper, the three of us living together without benefit of marriage.
Did I just hear a proposal?
No, but now you've made it awkward.
Good heavens, I wanted to marry you the first time I set eyes on you.
Karen, before God, before these toothless whores and aging alcoholics, before my daughter, I proclaim my love.
Will you marry me?
Of course I will, Lyle.
That is how you pronounce it, right?
Yeah, Lyle, yeah.
Oh, this is so exciting!
Finally, the old man's getting married.
And congratulations to you too, Dad.
okay, take the time.

There you go. [Rumbles in the sky]
Dad, Dad, it's up here.
Slow down Sam, slowdown.
Wow!

Move, go, go, go!
Sam, you're all right?
I'm scared!
Wuh?

Watch out!
How're you doing Dallas?
Eddie.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I usually ride in the back.
It seems you remember you're being with me a couple of those times.
You've got work lined up?
Why?
You hiring?
I had enough trouble convincing people I belonged in the job, but I'll ask around town for you.
I appreciate it.
You, uh, seen my brother?
Actually, I've been seeing him too much.
You gotta wear the hat.
Drew, the only reason you make us wear a hat is because the manager made you wear a hat when you were drunk.
Look, the only reason you got this job, is because the guidance counsellor begged me to give it to you
Yes, I'm sure the fact that she is hot has nothing to do with that huh.
14-27 Watercross.
I can' make that delivery, I can' do it.
This is no democracy.
Make the run or you are fired.
And wear the hat!
[Indistinct radio chatter]
[Radio chatter:
Copy that, R31D]
Harry, we keep telling you guys to stay out of here and you keep coming back.
I hate to do this , but I'm gonna have to take you in.
Let me just get my dog.
Butch!
Come on boy, what is that?
Jesus.
Sheriff, Sheriff.
Hey, Ricky.
-
- Hi, Jesse.
Come on in
Can we get you something to drink?
I'm good, thanks.
Cute outfit, Rick.
-
- Yes, isn't Halloween in October?
Yes now I know who's ordered the "Sausage Lovers" (pizza).
My purse is in the kitchen.
I'm sorry.
He is such an a**hole.
Yeah, well, you always know how to pick 'em, Jess.
Well now you and I have a little secret...
I am getting ready to fire him.
Fire him.
That's funny.
So what do I owe you?
Err, USD 53.50
Keep it.
Thanks.
I'll see you later.
Come on -
- Dale, Dale, stop it
Was that laugh you've got worth it?
Huh, no answer?
-

Gives me my keys.
Find them in 30 minutes or less, a**hole.
Let's go. bitch!
Let's go Jesse.
Ray, you find anything?
Nothing.
Anyone parked at the turn-out?
Only Ben's truck.
Jesus, Eddie.
He usually go out with his kid.
Dad?
Dad?
Hey, I missed you so much.
She's so big, -
- Yes I know
Hi.
-
- I can't believe that you're at home.
It has been so long.
Do you want some help?
Is this for me?
You don't like them?
Are you kidding me, these are so cool!
I'll show you how they work later, ok.
Well.
You've got problem with the door?
When did you get back?
-
- Today.
What happened to your face?
We'll talk about that latter -
- Ricky.
We'll talk about that later.
-
- No let's talk about that right now
Get your hands off me, get your ****ing hands off -
- What happened to your face?
Dale Collins and his friends jolted me.
They threw my keys in the sewer.
All right, give me the bat!
What're do you doing here.
Ricky I'm not gonna ask you again, give me the ****ing bat!
Come on, I'll help you find your keys.
Butch, shut up!
Barry, you better save some for me.
Mom.
-
- Sorry, it's bed time, honey.
I am not sleepy yet.
Molly, put those away.
It's time for bed.
I love you.
I want Dad to read it.
I love you.
See you in the morning.
Do you remember all those times you told me, how you missed your mom.
It's OK to tell Mommy that.
Ok.
Hurry up.
You want to do it?
-
- You're the convict in the family.
Very funny.
Help me with this, okay?
Why don't we climb down where they threw your keys.
So that Jessie can see me climb out covered in shit?
No, thanks.
Amazing.
We're gonna be covered in shit?
Take this.
It's gross down here.
-
- No, I could think of worse places.
I guess nobody's home -
- Is that a couch?
Yeah, it's nicer than ours.
What the hell?
It smells like something died down here.
Are you sure this is the right way?
It should be right up here.
That's the drainage.
- Check down there.
They're your keys a**hole.
You got hands.
- Yes, and I'm not sticking it in that shit.
You can do it.
Knock yourself up.
Tel me about this girl.
- What girl?
The one you got your ass kicked over.
- She's the girl.
Nobody goes around digging in shit just for a girl, okay.
What the hell was that?
- Relax, just a rat.
F***ing rat.
Check that drain.
I got them.
Let's go.
Sam!
-
- Ray, head towards the bridge.
Sam, where you?
Buddy?
-
- Buddy?
Sam.
Sally, bring them in.
Where are you Buddy?
We won't stop looking for you, Sam.
Thank you guys.
Pay attention please?
Eddie.
We will start up again first thing tomorrow.
My son and my husband are out here, somewhere.
They wouldn't stop looking for me.
Do you think that...something happened?
- I dunno.
Why don't you go home and get some rest.
You'll need your strength.
OK.
[Indistinct radio chatter]
Ray, anything?
Negative, I'll run again along the ridge.
All right, keep in touch.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.
.
MISSING Sam and Buddy Benson
Excuse me, Sir.
Have you seen my husband and my son?
Thank you.
Pardon me, can give you read this.
This is my husband and my son.
Keep an eye?
- Of course.
How is the job hunt going?
Is "breaking and entering" a special skill?
Do you have a suggestion?
I hear the bank is hiring.
Any word on Buddy and his kid?
Carrie, coffee please.
You were there all night huh?
No, we called it off at 2am.
Ray didn't come home?
- Eddy, I thought he was with you.
I've tried his cellphone.
- Carrie, listen to me.
Ray was pushing real hard last night.
I'm sure he's still looking.
Cell reception out th...
He always calls, Eddy.
Ray, you down there?
I cannot believe that this is Ray.
I do not wanna believe it either.
Do you know what it takes for someone to do this?
For someone to skin a human being?
There were no tracks.
Nothing.
Eddie, you're in over your head.
What are you gonna do?
I'll let you know when I figure it out.
Hey.
- Hey, Jessie.
Hi.
You know, you looked at me the same way in class.
Yeah, well, the clock's behind you.
- What?
Tomorrow when you're in class, turn around.
Yes, I know its there, but we both know that not what you're looking at.
You know, you never were a good liar.
Do you want to go swimming tonight?
- Swimming?
Where?
- At school.
Come on, it will be like old times.
Old time like before you had a boyfriend?
Yeah, and he's ex-boyfriend actually.
He's been fired?
So, tonight, around 10pm.
See you tonight.
We're closing now.
- I'll see you whan you get here.
You're all right?
If you want talk.
It's OK.
You're welcomed to stay with me and Cathy tonight
Darcy's coming by to pick me up.
I'll sleep at hers.
I'll see you tomorrow.
We found Ray's body in the woods.
It was odd.
He was skinned alive.
Do you think it's got something to do with Buddy and his kid disappearing?
I think this kind of thing doesn't happen here.
[Radio] Sheriff, we have report of a small gas explosion in the sewer on 16th Street, do you copy?
Roger dispatch, notify the Fire Dept.
I will meet them there.
[Radio] Right away, Sheriff.
Dispatch out.
You want some help?
- I don't know Dallas.
Come on, I'll ride in the back.
So...
How do we get in?
I've taped up the lock, after class.
I couldn't decide on which suit I wanted to wear, so...
Now, you tell me...
Are you looking at me or the clock?
Come here.
What do you think you're doing, Jess?
- Dale, get out of here.
Just remember, Ricky.
I taught this s**t everything she knows.
No, Ricky, stop it!
Stop it.
Dale, stop it.
Stop it, he's drowning.
What the hell was that?
Oh my God, get out of the water.
Jess, go.
Go.
Get out of the pool.
Help me.
Help me.
This side.
Is Ricky dead?
- Why don't you go back and find out.
Come, let's go.
- Go.
Window.
Come on.
Help me.
Go.
Daddy.
Daddy.
- What is it?
It was outside the window.
What?
- Some monster.
Aww, come here.
When I was your age, I used to have these awful nightmares.
I saw it.
It was real.
See.
No monster.
Daddy!
We have to go.
Come on.
-
- Daddy!
The fire's spread to the whole plant.
We have to shut down the reactors manually.
Roger that.
Dispatch?
We have to evacuate the entire town.
Call the National Guard in Colorado Springfield for assistance, over.
Copy that.
Jesus.
Sheriff.
- Yes?
I think you should hear about this...
Dallas.
- OK, thanks a lot.
I saw something came up to us, I don't know what happened.
What do you mean something came up.
- Where were you?
Slow down, where were you?
- I don't know.
Where were you?
- We went to school.
Mark, he's dead.
I think they got Nick too.
What was it?
Ricky?
I don't know.
Call help.
Somebody's gota know about this.
Eddie.
Dispatch, where's our backup?
Dipatch, come in!
Dispatch, come in.
Let's go.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Carrie, the power's out.
Help me!
I don't think the police station is not such a hot idea.
What do you want me to do?
We do not know what we're dealing here.
Come on.
- Look out.
Sheriff.
Darcy?
Darcy, what happened?
What are you doing?
Eddy, you must...
- What?
[Incoherent] Carrie are also here.
They're all covered in blood.
They're all gone.
She's dead.
Ricky, get her inside.
Get her in.
Hey, people are dying.
We need guns.
The National Guard will be here soon.
- Not soon enough.
I can't believe I'm letting you do this.
This plan is stupid.
Let's just leave town now.
We're not gonna make it without weapons.
You are too stupid to talk, Dale, just shut up.
Where are the guns?
- Follow me.
Here they are.
Dale, get some bags.
Jessie, load them up.
Eddy, you got power on that thing?
Yes, I just need some light.
Go, go, go.
0-1, scout the area.
0-2 secure the perimeter....[indistinctive]
Roger.
0-6 out.
Move.
Move.
What's your status 0-1 has the area secured.
0-2 has secured the perimeter.
This is Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard, come in.
Repeat, Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard, come in.
This is Lieutenant Wood, 89th Troop Commander Colorado National Guard.
Go ahead, Sheriff.
What is your location, Lieutenant, over?
We are on Main Street.
Look, Lieutenant, I don't know what your men is walking into.
But our situation is getting worse.
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?
We've a missing man.
- Hold on, sheriff.
We've got gunshots...[indistinct chatter] We've been ambushed!
What the hell's going on out there?
Pull back.
I repeat, pull back.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, are you there?
[Static]
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?
We're not gonna make it are we?
Don't shoot, take what you want.
I'm not gonna get killed for USD 6.25 an hour.
We've been attacked.
- Terrorists had done this sir?
I told you they would, one day.
What you guys, stoned?
Do you see that?
Are you hurt?
Come on in.
It should be safe here.
Hold on.
No pulse and breathing.
Take him straight to intensive care.
When's the light going back on?
We are on emergency generators, until the power's restored.
I think my water just broke.
Okay, I will find the doctor.
You two look pretty shaken up.
- Hasn't been an easy night for her.
And what about you?
I'll live.
We're leaving in 5 minutes.
Thank you.
Where is he?
Give me the gun.
Come on.
Mummy.
Turn back.
It's a trap.
It's a trap.
It's a trap.
Go.
-
- Molly, come on, run.
Run.
Come here.
- My God.
F**k this.
What is this f**king s**t?
What was that thing?
That's not possible.
Something's wrong.
Check the other room.
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.
What the hell?
- This is our help?
What the f**k is going on, Eddie?
Where are all the bodies?
- They are gonna kill us all.
We are not dead yet.
There may be weapons we can still use.
Radio.
National Guard, come in.
Repeat, any National Guard unit, come in.
This is Colonel Stevens, US Army.
Identify yourself.
Sheriff Eddie Morales, in Colorado.
You must help us, Colonel.
We have here a kind of infestation.
And if we don't get help soon, there won't be any of us left.
What's the Army's evacuation plan?
Colonel?
Colonel, we need immediate evac.
Sheriff, all ground routes have been compromised.
There is an airlift, in 30 minutes from Gilliam Circle.
Confirmed.
Airlift.
Gilliam Circle.
We will be there in 20 minutes.
But that's right in the centre of town.
We will be there, Colonel.
What the f**k are you.
Everyone, get in the APC.
I'll drive.
Do you think you can drive that thing?
I will get on the gun.
- Don't miss.
Don't crash.
Hold on.
Why are we stopping?
- It doesn't make any sense.
Gillian Circle is right in the centre of town.
We will be surrounded by those things.
Why are you saying?
- I think that the Colonel is lying.
But that is crazy.
The government doesn't never lie to people.
The army thinks about containment first.
They can't risk this getting worse.
But a few miles down that road, there will be waiting for us.
If you don't wanna drive us there, I will.
if she is right, then the only thing down that road is more of these things.
You're not seriously considering this?
- I'm considering whatever keeps us alive.
Which means getting out of this town.
There are only two helicopters in town.
One is at the airport..
No, that's too far.
We'll never make it there.
- The other is at the hospital.
The people at the hospital probably used it to get out.
That's a chance we have to take.
If you have wrong and the helicopter is gone, we're all dead.
If I am right, they'll die if they follow you.
There's a truck coming.
Dallas, what the hell are you doing in there?
- Never mind that.
You guys heading to the air lift?
- Yes.
Follow us.
We don't have much time.
Listen up.
Everybody's gotta choose right now.
We're going to the hospital with the tank.
We're going to the center of the town.
- That is right.
I'm going with my brother.
- I'll go along with you.
I'm going in the tank.
Dallas, don't do this.
She's wrong.
And brother or not, he's wrong.
You're gonna get them killed.
We are running out of time, Sheriff, We gotta move now.
Hold on.
We're coming with you.
Wait.
Take care.
I hope we're both wrong.
Lets go.
I didn't help anybody.
I was too scared.
I just watched them die.
All right, put these on.
You too.
All right, listen.
Whatever happens inside, the only person who can't get hurt is Kelly.
We all protect Kelly.
What is this, the Titanic?
Screw the "women and children first", man.
Look, a**hole, unless you can fly the helicopter, shut up.
Let's go, now.
Maybe they are all gone.
Fu**ing shoot it!
Jesse, no wait.
- Move, now.
Jesse, wait.
Ricky, wait.
Mother...
Come on.
Come on, get up.
You're gonna make it.
We have to go.
Now.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
[Indistinct shouting]
Is this everybody?
- This is all that's left.
What have you heard?
- The air lift will be here soon.
Clear!
Come.
Go go.
You're all right?
- Yes.
Come here.
Go go.
Follow your mom.
Come on.
- Everyone, move.
Run Molly.
Dallas.
- I'm trying.
Are you going to use that thing?
- Hang on.
Lets go.
You got her?
Colonel Stevens?
This is Gunnison County... requesting status on your evac, over.
Colonel, where's the air lift.
Sheriff, we are still 10 miles out.
Hold your position, over.
Colonel, we're here over.
God help us all.
Okay, get out of here, now.
I will buy us some time.
I'm not leaving you.
- Get to the chopper.
You don't have to do this, Dallas.
Now.
Go, go.
Come on, you motherf**kers.
Come, over here.
Come on.
OK, go.
Hey, come on over here!
We're not leaving without him.
- We have to go.
He will make it.
Die.
Let's go.
Close your eyes.
Hang on.
- Mummy.
Hang on.
Hey, you're all right?
Ricky?
- Press here, yes, hard.
Drop your weapons.
You bastards killed the entire town.
- We're just following orders.
Put down your weapons.
We need a medic, for my brother.
Medivac is inbound.
Secure any weapons and let set up a perimeter.
Go, move it.
I told you not to crash.
Mummy?
Are the monsters' gone?
They are gone.
The world isn't ready for this technology.
But this isn't for our world, is it Miss Yutani?
You said come back Tuesday.
It's Tuesday.
I want my suit.
Patience, brother.
You know how much I care about the details.
It doesn't have to be pretty, Hephaestus.
Where it's going, things aren't supposed to be pretty.
Present company excluded, of course.
Just hurry up.
My finishing touch.
The Annihilator.
Heartless, indestructible and ready to feed on mankind's misery and rage.
Per your specifications.
Go ahead, Ares.
Give it life.
[GRUNTS]
Enough.
Wrap it up.
I'll take it.
[GUNFIRE]
Impressive.
Isn't it?
I knew about advances in unmanned weaponry, but this is incredible.
Who built it?
Ever heard the expression,
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth"?
Ah.
Classified.
Now, I've already taken the liberty of imprinting it to your voice commands.
So, Mr. Nardoc, the only question is, are you interested?
Of course.
Anything to protect us from those dogs in the South.
But, Mr. Sera, you know how little money we have.
We can worry about that later.
You're joking, right?
[CHUCKLES]
No, I trust you.
It's not like you're going anywhere, is it?
With this weapon's help?
No.
We are certainly staying right here.
Follow.
[ALARM RINGING]
MAN:
Come on, go, go, go!
[HORNS HONKING]
[MEN GRUNTING]
I try to take a day off, try to have a semblance of a normal life, but you had to pick today to rob a bank.
[GRUNTS]
[GUN CLICKS]
Oh, yeah.
Like that's going to work.
Wait.
Please.
I've learned my lesson.
I promise.
No, you haven't.
[YELLING]
Your kind never learns.
And it's really starting to get on my nerves.
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
Diana.
In a minute.
Diana!
I'm not finished here.
I'd say you are.
[GROANING] [SIRENS WAILING]
Fine.
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
Queen Adria of Kaznia has asked the League for help.
Her nation is being torn apart by warring paramilitary groups.
Each faction has ties with neighboring countries.
If this escalates, it could easily ignite the region.
What's wrong with people, J'onn?
Hostility's their answer to everything.
You're not one to talk, of late.
What's that supposed to mean?
Diana, you and I have both been affected by our time among humans.
It's important that we keep ourselves in check.
First of all, those thugs back there got exactly what they had coming.
As did that band of mercenaries last week.
And those creatures from the Decorin Nebula.
They weren't misunderstood.
They thought we were food!
You're right, Diana.
None of it has anything to do with you.
Before heading to Kaznia, you're going to have to make a stop.
Fine mess here, Don.
Talk to them.
You speak Neanderthal.
I think they're done talking.
This is ridiculous.
Just because I disagree with you doesn't make me unpatriotic.
No.
You bein' a bleedin'- heart punk makes you unpatriotic.
Actually, I gotta agree with him on that one.
Too late tryi" to side with us.
You're both taking' a beating.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Look, we got off on the wrong foot.
But don't you think we could find plenty of things we all have in common if we just tried?
No.
Hank, say something.
[GRUNTS]
Preemptive strike.
[GROWLING]
Hawk.
Dove.
Boo.
[GROWLS]
[GRUNTING]
Oh, you so wanted to do this.
Don't blame me.
You're the one who couldn't keep your trap shut.
[MEN GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTS] [BEEPING]
[GROWLING]
Aaahh!
Now, how about you calm down, and I'll let you go?
How about you kiss my...?
Aaahh!
[GROWLING]
[WHIMPERS]
You didn't answer your summons.
Look around, princess.
Had our hands full.
Enough to go around if you want a piece.
Out.
Now.
Aaaahh!
[CRASH]
The Northern tribes have infested our motherland for too many generations.
Kaznia is ours by the blood of our fathers and our fathers' fathers.
[MEN CHATTERING]
Right now, they're preparing a new weapon, a weapon with fearsome power.
We've got to attack now to protect your farms and your families from their vicious hands.
[MEN CHEERING]
Move out, and may fortune be with you!
Why not just let them obliterate each other?
If people can't control their own country, they don't deserve to have one.
DOVE:
Way to oversimplify.
These folks live in poverty.
And when you have so little, it's easy to be swayed into blaming your neighbor.
Almost all aggression can be cured with education.
Yeah?
Then how come some of the best-educated guys in the world work at the Pentagon?
Down there.
[MEN SHOUTING]
Who is that?
DOVE:
These people don't stand a chance against it.
Hawk, you're with me.
Dove...
I'm on it.
[MEN GRUNTING]
[GUN COCKS]
Both of you, scram.
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
There's no one inside that thing.
How do you fight that?
You hit it till it breaks.
[BOTH GRUNT]
DOVE:
Hey!
What are you doing?
You pulled us right out of battle.
She just saved our lives, Hank.
Two yards would've done that.
This is what's called a retreat.
There was no point continuing.
We were having no effect on that thing.
If anything, it was getting stronger.
There's gotta be a way to stop this war.
If we could just get the two leaders to sit down together.
Oh, 'cause that happens all the time in these situations.
Unless you wanna just kidnap 'em and make 'em talk.
I wish.
Then go for it.
At least it'll buy me some time.
Why?
What are you doing?
I've gotta see a man about a suit of armor.
ARES:
You let them go.
Why didn't you push ahead and take their camp?
They have enough arsenal there to launch an assault against the capital.
I have no designs on the capital.
We won, Mr. Sera.
The animals attacked, and we ran them out of town.
I didn't give you The Annihilator so you could run your enemies out of town.
I gave you The Annihilator so you could annihilate them!
Forgive the insult, sir, but you think like a South Kaznian.
They want to destroy us all, but my brothers and I only wish to keep our land.
Perhaps I could take their camp, but the price would be too great.
Shall I win a country but massacre my people?
Yes, you idiot!
I think like a South Kaznian?
Has it even entered your skull that they think like South Kaznians?
And you better start thinking that way too if you want there to be a Northerner left in this rat-infested dirt heap you call a country.
All any of you mortals are good for is to slaughter one another.
To fight and fight, until the bones of your enemies are strewn across the battlefield, only to rise again in the next generation, like a well-tended crop.
That's what The Annihilator is for.
But no, you're using it to play tag.
You know what?
You're crazy, and I wash my hands of you.
I'll thank you to get out of my rat-infested dirt heap now.
And you can take your robot with you.
Better idea:
I stay.
You go.
I made that armor for your mother.
Did she ever thank me?
No.
I love your mom, but she didn't have your build.
I didn't come here to talk about my armor.
There's an armored suit fighting in Kaznia that needs no wearer and bears your mark.
The Annihilator.
Then you did make it.
Who else does such fine work?
Ares liked it.
Ares.
Of course.
How do you stop it?
Ah.
You knew to ask.
I do leave a small weakness in each of my creations.
An Achilles' heel, if you will.
It's so no one ever gets too powerful.
You know what they say,
"Only Zeus is perfect. "
And what's The Annihilator's weakness?
Diana, you wouldn't want me to go around telling people the weakness in your armor, would you?
[GRUNTS]
With that attitude, you'll never figure it out.
Come back when you have more time.
I'll let that suit out a little.
Hey.
Oof!
[MUFFLED SPEECH]
Sorry, kid.
You'll have a headache later.
But on the bright side, if this works, you'll live to see 20.
Don't be afraid.
My name is Dove.
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'd like you to come with me.
It's time to try a new path.
And what path is that?
Peace.
[ARES' VOICE] Hm.
Not really my thing.
But if you're into it,
I can arrange for you to have eternal peace.
After I'm done with you, that is.
[MAN SNORING]

Ever run away from home?
It's fun.

[GUNS COCK]
Lower your weapons!
You don't have a chance like that, so try it my way.
Lower your weapons.
HAWK:
Don!
Let go of me.
He's weak.
He'll get himself killed.
Don!
[SIGHS]
Anybody wanna give me a clue what just happened?
Sometimes it takes more strength not to fight.
What's the matter with you people?
Keep fighting!
This is your chance to finish them.
Give it up, Ares.
It's over.
You lose.
All right.
This time.
But I'll be back, and sooner than you think.
Wherever there's prejudice, ignorance, inequality,
I'll be there.
And I'll be waiting.
You see?
Doesn't this prove exactly what I've been saying for years?
Couldn't tell you.
I do my best not to listen.
What?
HAWK:
And another thing:
Don't go all Gandhi on me thinking you can pull this every time.
You said come back Tuesday.
It's Tuesday.
I want my suit.
Patience, brother.
You know how much I care about the details.
It doesn't have to be pretty, Hephaestus.
Where it's going, things aren't supposed to be pretty.
Present company excluded, of course.
Just hurry up.
My finishing touch.
The Annihilator.
Heartless, indestructible and ready to feed on mankind's misery and rage.
Per your specifications.
Go ahead, Ares.
Give it life.
[GRUNTS]
Enough.
Wrap it up.
I'll take it.
[GUNFIRE]
Impressive.
Isn't it?
I knew about advances in unmanned weaponry, but this is incredible.
Who built it?
Ever heard the expression,
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth"?
Ah.
Classified.
Now, I've already taken the liberty of imprinting it to your voice commands.
So, Mr. Nardoc, the only question is, are you interested?
Of course.
Anything to protect us from those dogs in the South.
But, Mr. Sera, you know how little money we have.
We can worry about that later.
You're joking, right?
[CHUCKLES]
No, I trust you.
It's not like you're going anywhere, is it?
With this weapon's help?
No.
We are certainly staying right here.
Follow.

I've learned my lesson.

In a minute.
Diana!
I'm not finished here.
I'd say you are.
[GROANING] [SIRENS WAILING]
Fine.
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
Queen Adria of Kaznia has asked the League for help.
Her nation is being torn apart by warring paramilitary groups.
Each faction has ties with neighboring countries.
If this escalates, it could easily ignite the region.
What's wrong with people, J'onn?
Hostility's their answer to everything.
You're not one to talk, of late.
What's that supposed to mean?
Diana, you and I have both been affected by our time among humans.
It's important that we keep ourselves in check.
First of all, those thugs back there got exactly what they had coming.
As did that band of mercenaries last week.
And those creatures from the Decorin Nebula.
They weren't misunderstood.
They thought we were food!
You're right, Diana.
None of it has anything to do with you.
Before heading to Kaznia, you're going to have to make a stop.
Fine mess here, Don.
Talk to them.
You speak Neanderthal.
I think they're done talking.
This is ridiculous.
Just because I disagree with you doesn't make me unpatriotic.
No.
You bein' a bleedin'- heart punk makes you unpatriotic.
Actually, I gotta agree with him on that one.
Too late tryi" to side with us.
You're both taking' a beating.

Control to all units.
Hit and run.
Suspect in a white van heading south on Leigh Street.
November 7 to control.
Suspect Manor Park and Leigh.
Officer in pursuit.
Suspect's on foot.
Dog Leap Stairs.
White male.
Mid to late twenties.
Short cropped hair, black and white shirt.
Number nine on the back.
Suspect's entering the Hayfield pub.
I've got him.
Stop!
The accused suggests that she's a victim of entrapment.
A monetary transaction took place, didn't it, Officer?
Her services were procured and rendered.
Only then did you identify yourself and make the arrest.
That's not true.
That's not true.
We set the operation up.
I went in, had a massage, she solicited me.
I made my excuses and left and then went back and made the arrest.
How much money were you carrying?
- The £25 entrance fee.
And you have a witness who can corroborate that?
Someone who searched you?
Can confirm you had only £25 on you?
Henderson was meant to.
- Meant to?
He was hung up in court so I went ahead.
I had made the appointment and I didn't think it was right not to go.
You didn't want to inconvenience the brothel?
- That's not what I mean.
Oh, you're a very polite young man.
I didn't want to raise suspicion by changing it or not showing up.
Oh, so you thought, "I'm on my own.
It won't matter."
You paid Amber and she...
- That's not true!
You were carrying £100, Detective Yates, weren't you?
And you offered it in order to entrap the defendant.
No!
- Prove it.
He's compromised.
His testimony will be ripped apart.
There's no point in bringing charges.
Well, if we don't charge her, we've got no leverage.
We'll never get her to offer up information...
That was a clean arrest.
The woman's guilty.
We all know that.
Yeah.
We do, but you gave her reasonable doubt and she's gonna walk.
Okay.
The point is not the girl.
We want the people running the brothel.
We need to get one of these girls to turn before anyone else gets hurt.
We do it again.
Who can we get?
No chilli sauce.
Not the same without the chilli sauce.
Nah, at 2 a.m. I'll be suffering, mate.
Go on, breathe on the bad guys.
They'll all confess.
Robbery reported.
90 Osborne Road, Jesmond.
Detective requested.
Yeah, on me way.
Keep it warm.
Chips and a Coke.
I remember the first time in London.
Never seen buildings tall like that in me life.
I had hopes, tall as those buildings.
Why did you come?
Keep brushing.
I was living in a small village on the outskirts of Port of Spain and England was paved with gold.
Is that why you came?
Because of the gold?
- I guess.
At that time England needed workers and the people in the West Indies needed jobs.
I was a strapping young man.
Strong.
Stronger than Nicky?
Much stronger than Nicky.
Can whip little Nicky no problem.
Had arms full of iron.
You're old, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm old, but I'm still strong.
Well, actually I live upstairs but they're students, you see, so they're coming and going at all hours.
It's a burglary, Clark.
I don't think we need the tape.
So when I heard the noise, well, I didn't pay any attention to it at first.
We need to secure the crime scene.
But I remembered seeing the girls leaving their flat.
I was washing me windows.
I'm not the nosy neighbour type.
We can do that without the tape.
I like doing the tape.
Constable, why don't you take Mrs Kliner's statement?
Forced entry.
Broke the window.
Came into the house.
Really?
No, Clark.
Hmm.
Could be here a long time investigating this one.
Sorry.
How embarrassing.
I can't believe I've left them out.
No problem.
Just having a good look round.
See if they've left any, you know, evidence.
You'll need to get that door repaired.
- Yeah.
This has never happened to me before.
It's a bit frightening, I know.
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Just shaken up, I guess.
You don't have to be afraid now because we're here.
Maybe your boyfriend could come over later.
I don't really have one.
- You don't have one?
That's just a tragedy.
There's some black guy in the living room.
You stay here out of harm's way.
I'll sort it out, don't worry.
Clark.
- Don't worry, Sergeant.
I'll deal with the intruder.
What you got?
- It's him.
Him?
That's not a black man.
That's the night detective.
This one kind of reminded me of that one.
So then I notice that the white fluffy little dog has got some blood around the corner of his mouth.
What, on the fluffy bit?
- Yeah.
Kind of like a fluffy little white beard.
Was the burglar disturbed?
He must have been, to do something like this.
But I figure that the dog must have got a piece of the burglar, which means there's the culprit's DNA on the dog.
They broke in through the door in the kitchen?
Yeah.
Fence gate doesn't have a lock.
They had easy access to the back of the building.
"They"?
There was more than one?
- We don't know that.
Okay.
We don't know that.
So I get SOCO to cut a piece of the fluffy beard off for analysis.
We run it.
Two weeks later.
Bang.
That's like my favourite burglary story that.
I thought your favourite was the bloke who stole the knickers...
Uh, can you tell me that one later?
Mrs Kliner in the flat upstairs heard a noise, called the police.
Kelly and I were at a lecture.
Lucky you weren't here.
Would have been terrifying to be in the house alone without a man, you know, friend, here to protect you.
What did they steal?
I don't think they stole anything.
They didn't steal anything?
- They stole the cash from my handbag.
Mine, too.
That's terrible.
Where were the bags?
In the kitchen.
- Yeah.
I mean, something like this happens.
It's hard to sleep.
You get anxious.
I mean, they've been in your flat.
Can you dust the computer, Mr Humby?
Did you look through the flat, Sergeant?
We've looked around .
Everything else is okay.
Right.
Good.
Strange, innit?
I mean, if you're a burglar, not that I've been one, but you sort of think, "Get in, get out."
You don't kinda think, "Get in, trash the place, get out."
Yeah.
Are you okay?
It's frightening now but it will pass.
Yeah.
It's twisted that is, if you're the average burglar.
Well, maybe the burglar wasn't average.
Yeah, that is a possibility, which is where my head's kind of going right now.
I mean, I'm looking at you and I'm thinking, any boyfriends you've disappointed?
No.
Kelly doesn't have a boyfriend.
Mind you, if it's a love thing, would they really steal money?
But you know what?
People always surprise me.
You know what I mean?
What kind of lecture were you at?
- Psychology.
Ah, I took some psychology courses.
Could never get my head around them.
Always more questions than answers.
I remember my uncle saying to me,
"If you had a bit more philosophy, you wouldn't need so much psychology."
What does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Here's my guess... if you know what someone believes in, you have a better idea of how they're going to behave.
Probably a load of rubbish, eh?
- Probably.
Yeah.
Probably.
Look, if it's a stalker, or something like that, you need to tell me so we can help you.
You have no idea who might have done this?
'Cause I'll be honest,
I'm stuck.
I don't get it.
It's a mystery.
Yeah, it is.
There is science that can help us.
I mean, it's not psychology or philosophy, but some people think it's a bit more exact.
And dust the kitchen door handle and the security light above the door.
The problem with science is it only helps if you have some idea who you're looking for, which takes us back to psychology and philosophy really, doesn't it?
Course, if they've got previous, and they're on the computer, do not pass go.
Can't do that.
Too high.
Step won't reach.
Stand on the top step, man.
No problem.
Can't.
Not the top step.
Health and Safety.
Do you girls by any chance...
We can't tell him...
- Sorry.
You don't have a ladder, do you?
No, no.
Can't use their ladder.
Health and Safety.
You know, if I fall, I'm not covered.
Had a seminar on it just last week.
Line manager would kill us.
How about if I hold you on the ladder?
No.
No.
Can't do that.
Health and Safety.
Have to come back later.
The Forensics Officer will have to come back later.
I could come back later with him, if it'd help.
A week later we stop a bloke without a tax disc.
Big burly fella with his gut spilling out of his jeans and T-shirt.
Full of backchat.
Looks like trouble, didn't he, eh?
So we get him out of the car...
Rick asks for his licence and insurance.
He leans to get the papers out of the glove compartment and when he bends over...
- He's wearing a thong.
A woman's thong.
Can you believe it?
When we search the house he's got hundreds of them.
That's like Rick's favourite story, innit, Rick?
- Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's one of many.
Why would you destroy a computer when you could have nicked it?
And they haven't nicked anything else in the flat.
Didn't have time .
Neighbour disturbed them.
But they had time to trash the place?
Nah.
And the money from the bags?
Drugs?
A junkie, once he's got the cash, he doesn't care about nicking the rest of the gear.
No, they're lying about something.
Well, hang about.
They're the victims.
Students with no money?
Why are they going to lie?
Oh!
What?
You don't think they were lying about not having a boyfriend?
I thought the one with the blonde hair was quite nice.
Did you, Clarky?
We didn't notice.
They go to a lecture and leave their bags and money in the flat.
Probably just forgot about it.
Both of them?
There you go, lads.
- Ah, cheers, man.
You dump the boyfriend.
He's jealous, breaks in and trashes the place 'cause he's cross.
Takes the money 'cause it's there.
Or they borrowed it from him or something and he wants it back now that he's dumped.
Chilli?
- Please.
You want some, Nicky?
No.
Thanks.
- You've got to have chilli sauce, man.
What's the point of having a kebab without chilli sauce?
I told him the same thing.
It's quiet here tonight, innit?
The uniforms put the drug dealers and drunks off.
How's Matty?
Yeah.
He's good.
Pubs are closing.
Who's Matty?
He's my boy.
You got a kid?
Well, actually he's my brother's boy.
I look after him.
Where's your brother?
- Clark, if he wants to tell us, he will, all right?
No, it's all right.
He's in prison.
What did he do?
- Clark!
He shot a bloke.
Drugs turf war.
So now you're sitting there thinking one of two things,
"Oh, God, I wish I hadn't said that."
Or, "How much is he like his brother?"
What happened to the boy's mother?
She's a casualty.
Matty was three when my brother Adam got done.
I tried to check on him and his mum once a week.
Tina?
It's me.
Tina?
Hi, Nicky.
You all right?
Okay, look, let's go, all right.
I'm taking Matty.
Yeah.
All right.
I don't know what happened to her I don't care.
She's got her own prison sentence.
Boy all right?
Yeah, yeah he's good.
Only problem is he loves Fulham.
Can't expect him to grow up in London and not have something wrong with him.
You know, it could have been what Clarky says.
It could have been a jealous boyfriend.
We can't agree with anything Clarky says, right?
That's just one of the rules.
Even if I'm right?
- Even if you're right, which you never are.
A junkie that hates computers.
You guys like spicy chicken, don't you?
"You guys?"
Yeah.
If you like that, you're gonna like chilli on a kebab.
It's only girls that don't like chilli on a kebab.
Am I right, Rick?
You know, Rick, that seems like a really good rule.
Hey, we're off duty soon.
Better write this up.
Put it on your desk?
Yeah, cheers.
I'll be back in a bit to put the file together.
Enjoy the night.
Don't work too hard.
November 7 on my way.
DS Cole.
Body in the river, divers have just finished recovery.
Who's the officer in charge?
Ever pulled a body out of a river?
Current's strong, pulls you right under.
Strong enough to tear your clothes off.
You sink and it's only after your body starts to decompose that the gases pull you up to the surface like a balloon.
That sucker's down.
He ain't getting up.
Neutral corner, son.
Hey.
- Hey.
Good night?
Yeah.
In one piece.
Soul intact.
Good lad.
Bad stomach?
Indigestion.
Spicy foods?
I told you to give spicy foods a wide berth.
A wide berth.
- But do you listen?
Gives you indigestion.
Metabolism goes haywire and it makes you fat.
Drink some milk quick.
Coat your stomach up good.
How you gonna catch villains when you got acid in your gullet, eh?
Luckily it was slow.
I caught up on paperwork.
You look shattered, boy.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Matty still in bed?
- Yeah.
I'll wake him up after this last round.
Hey, hey, man get up.
Give me three minutes, I'll finish him off.
I'll wake him.
Seconds out.
I dreamt Fulham won.
You sure it wasn't half-time?
- Stop it.
Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.
Is Errol stronger than you?
In so many ways.
That's what he said.
He said that?
- Said he could whip you.
No chance.
I'm the big dog in this house.
He said he had arms full of iron.
Yeah, and a head full of it as well.
He travelled 3,000 miles to get to England.
Yeah, a big adventure.
He's a brave man.
We travelled a long way to get here.
Does it mean we're brave?
Oh, I don't know about me, but you are.
That's quite cool.
- Yeah, it's very cool.
But you can be brave just crossing the road, okay?
Being proud of who you are, making the best of what you got and not throwing it away, that's being brave as well.
I've got quite a lot.
- Yeah, you do.
More than you?
No chance.
I got you.
Now get up.
Get yourself dressed.
I'll walk you to school.
I've got you.
Yeah, you do.
Maybe we're quits.
Hello!
Hello?
Over here.
Hello.
I've seen you, but I don't think we've met.
Errol Hill.
- I know we haven't met.
Do you have to punch that thing every morning?
No, I don't have to.
I like to.
You see, I've made a point in life not to do things that I have to, when I could be doing things I like to.
It wakes me up.
- Yeah, it does the same for me.
It's going to be like this, is it?
- Oh, yes.
Nice to meet you.
We still haven't met.
Hello?
Oh, sorry, sir.
Just a second.
Right.
No, no, sir.
I was already awake.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with you.
Yeah, okay.
I'll come in early.
No, no problem at all.
Okay.
Bye.
We've had information that a Manchester organisation is trying to muscle in on our brothel trade.
There was a particularly nasty bit of butchery about three months ago.
A bloke running a house was stabbed to death and a couple of the girls were cut up.
Lovely.
Two more violent assaults in the past month which we believe are related.
Now, we've got decent leads on where they're operating.
They pick off set-ups which aren't protected and then scare them into working for them.
We've been running a task force for some time on this.
We've managed to identify their structure.
Each one of the zones has its own governor.
We think this is the bloke in charge of our patch.
Now in all the other zones, the Command Unit has ID and forensics on their man.
They're ready to make the arrests, but they're waiting on us.
We don't have enough yet, for various operational reasons.
The plan was to move on them all at once so none of them slip the net.
Our objective is to get the girls to turn and give us enough solid information to make the arrests.
And we've got a target, but we need clean bait.
Yates is compromised.
Paddy, you didn't...
- Detective!
Yeah, I'm up for it, as it were.
Have you done this before?
- No, I'm more of a kerb crawler.
Save the witty remarks for the pub.
This is our second bite at the cherry.
We won't get another chance.
No, I've not done this before, sir.
Patrick will talk you through it.
There's no room for improvisation.
All right.
Go to work.
And don't sound like a copper.
Be nervous, edgy.
You're not a bloke who does this every day.
- That won't be hard.
Yeah, hello?
Yeah.
I got your number and, uh...
Yeah.
Well, I wanted to make an appointment.
Yeah, 7:00 is good.
Uh, where do I go?
I mean, where is it?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Yeah, I'm just writing it down.
How much is it, the massage?
Twenty-five.
Okay.
Plus tips.
Yeah, I got you.
My name?
Mr Smith.
Yeah.
Okay, then.
See you.
Mr Smith?
And she's not gonna think I'm a copper?
Of course not.
She's probably got a Mr Smith at 8:00, one at 9:00 and one at 10:00.
Most of her tricks are married and don't want to get caught.
Okay.
Let's get you ready.
This is Sergeant Brookes and PC Denton.
They'll be helping us make the arrests.
We met, yeah?
- Yeah.
Empty your pockets.
Detective Cole has given me his wallet and any change and keys in his pockets.
Okay, strip.
What?
I've got to confirm that you're not carrying any other money secreted on your body.
It's okay.
I've seen it all before.
You've not seen this and I don't want to scare you.
What?
The boxers as well?
I don't want Miss Maxwell chewing my ear off for not following procedure.
Oh!
I'm frightened.
Detective Cole has nothing secreted on his body.
No, he does not.
Okay, you can put your clothes on.
I am giving Detective Cole £25.
Now, when they tell you to strip for the massage, you strip right down or they'll know you're a cop.
Okay.
Oh, and don't worry about scaring them.
Funny.
But I wouldn't want to see that thing angry.
Okay.
Let's go.
Your radio.
Listen, he could be watching the place.
He could be inside.
Be careful.
If it starts to go bad, you get out straightaway, yeah?
Who is it?
- Mr Smith.
You didn't say you were black.
Didn't cross my mind.
I'm not doing this one.
Shift!
Go on!
- Oi!
Keep your shirt on!
Hi, I'm Amber.
Tiffany doesn't do black men.
Boyfriend's a member of the BNP or something in Burnley.
Or is it Blackburn?
I don't know, one of them.
Anyway, she's worse about Asians.
She goes mental about them.
Don't worry, I haven't got a problem with it.
That's cheered me right up.
It's £25 for the massage.
Get undressed.
Sprained me ankle trying to get prints from the rail of a balcony on the Quayside.
Twisted it when I fell.
Manager told us I wasn't covered.
Who is it?
It's PC Clark.
- Who?
You made a big impression on her.
The police officer who was here yesterday.
We need to finish collecting any fingerprints or DNA the burglar may have left.
Oh, right.
Just a second.
Wasn't any prints anyway.
Another PC Plod with an overactive imagination.
Amount of time I waste because somebody in a uniform's got a bright idea.
It won't take long.
Too right it won't.
I'm off duty in 20 minutes.
Do you want talcum powder or baby oil, pet?
Uh...
For the massage?
Oh, um, baby oil, I guess.
You're fit.
Cheers.
Makes a nice change.
Cold?
Sorry, pet, I'll warm you up.
Hi.
- Hiya.
You okay?
Shattered.
Couldn't sleep at all last night.
I'm sorry.
Wish there was something I could do.
There is, Constable .
Help with the ladder.
Isn't there some health and safety rule about me doing this?
No.
He better not be enjoying himself too much in there.
Do you want extras?
Extras?
Yeah, okay.
How much?
Sixty.
Sixty?
What do I get for that?
Everything you want.
What, a new house, a new car and 10 grand a month for life?
You're gonna be fun.
Full sex for sixty, yeah?
And I'll throw in a cigarette after.
Can't say no to a deal like that.
Money first.
- Yeah.
Oh, I've left my wallet in the car.
I'll have to go and get it.
Yep.
Sure you did.
Are you a copper?
I'm just parked outside.
Are you a copper?
I won't be long.
He's a copper!
Zulu 4 to control.
Back-up.
We're going in.
I've called the police!
I am the police.
They're gone.
Was it our man?
Yeah.
What a cock up.
Great job.
You can explain this one to the boss.
The woman who answered the door was mid to late 30s, maybe 40.
Hard to tell.
She'd seen better days.
Tiffany was the name she used.
Big girl, about 5'8".
Ten stone.
Reddish hair.
The girl, Amber she called herself.
Looked a bit like this.
Hi, Amber.
Told you I'd come back.
Evening, Mr Smith.
You see that?
You were right.
Look at this.
Hundred pounds' worth of shirt ruined.
Well, if you ever do this again, go for the talcum powder.
How you doing, slick?
- You're a funny guy.
I thought you might need this.
We got some prints on that burglary, good clear ones on the security light.
Humby will send a report through.
Cool.
Thanks for the T-shirt.
Better get this off to forensics.
It's got our man's blood on it.
You know that body you pulled out of the river a few weeks ago, the Jane Doe the night we chased Naz.
Yeah.
I remember.
How long do you think she was in the water for?
If they're floaters, they're usually in for a few days.
Maguire's the expert.
Ask him.
I just need to double check on any missing persons reports that might not have been put in the computer.
How far could the body have travelled?
50 miles?
I'd start closer to home and work upriver.
That girl could have been from anywhere.
She could have been visiting a friend.
Who knows?
You're probably wasting your time.
Yeah.
It's funny how certain things can bother you.
To die an anonymous death like that, it's horrible, innit?
I don't know, maybe if I waste some time on it, it'll bother me less.
I need to ask you a favour.
- Go on.
Dominic?
Not here.
Later.
- Yes, sir?
The girl rumbled you before you made the arrest?
Yes, sir.
Sad but true.
How?
I made my excuses, saying I left my wallet in the car.
She asked me if I was a copper.
I didn't say no.
And she being the bright spark she is, she yelled out, "He's a copper."
And you couldn't have said something else?
It was a "Yes-No" question.
I couldn't say "Yes."
And if I lied, I didn't think it would sound too good in court.
No one's saying you should have lied.
I shouldn't jump to conclusions.
She did solicit me before it went pear-shaped.
Did she?
Oh.
Well, it's not quite the hole I thought we were in.
Miss Maxwell wants a quick chat with you ASAP before we decide to charge.
I'm two hours late for dinner.
Kelly, you expecting anyone?
Go away.
We don't want anything to do with this, okay?
Leave us alone.
No!
Please.
Leave us alone.
I've been fair.
I've warned you.
Now I want the money that you owe me.
We're not doing it anymore.
Yes, you will and you're gonna pay me.
Just a moment.
I'll review that and get back to you with a time.
Look forward to it.
I'll bet he does.
You just stepped over the line.
Yeah, I do that and I hate myself.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about procedure.
No!
Are you all right in there?
Hello?
Are you all right?
I've called the police!
You were searched?
Absolutely, every nook and cranny.
What a compelling thought.
Do you always work this late?
Not always.
Was there a witness to the search to confirm you had any other money on your person?
Oh, yeah.
Sergeant Brookes.
Female Sergeant Brookes?
- That's the one.
Oh, you're winding me up.
- No, I think it was Yates trying to wind me up.
Seemed odd to me, too, but I'm not shy.
Well, let's hope she volunteered.
I didn't see anyone twisting her arm.
Well, perhaps she wanted a good look.
Mmm.
She was very professional.
Of course.
When you were in the brothel you paid £25 for a massage?
Yes.
And you were naked when the massage was given?
As the day I was born.
Was there a physical signal that might have led the suspect to believe you wanted anything more than a massage?
A physical signal?
Oh.
I get you.
No.
I was there on business.
Good.
She used baby oil.
Rubbed up and down my body.
Seemed to like my thighs in particular.
Yeah, and my bum.
Spent a lot of time on the old gluteus maximus, which, quite frankly, made it feel pretty good.
I'm very happy for you.
And how did she make the solicitation?
She asked if I wanted extras.
- And you said?
I played dumb, which I thought was the safest option.
When you know what's on offer.
I waited for her to make the first move and explain what she had in mind.
You did?
So that the situation would be clear.
No chance the situation could be misinterpreted.
No chance I might be accused of entrapment.
And she made the offer of full sex?
Yes, she did.
She spelled out the terms of the transaction.
Sixty quid?
- Yeah.
And I made my excuses and started to leave.
- What excuses did you make?
I said, "I'll review that and get back to you with a time."
Now that's stepping over the line.
You pretend you didn't say it, I'll pretend I didn't hear it.
Control to November 7.
Assistance requested.
Yeah, on me way.
I said I left my wallet in the car.
Okay.
Okay, I think we've got enough to charge the girl.
You know what Carter's after?
- Yeah.
Well, you'll be very popular if she plays.
Popularity's what counts.
Gina!
Let us in, man.
Open the door!
Alan, go home!
Gina, just open the door now!
You're drunk.
- What's the matter with you?
I'm here now.
We can just go in.
- Evening!
Who are you?
- Neighbour.
Piss off.
- Mind your own business.
Listen...
- Get off.
Just trying to get some sleep next door, that's all.
I told you, piss off.
If you could just keep the noise down and try not to hurt each other, that would be good.
I never want to see you again.
Just leave us alone.
Now, just get off.
Hey!
I don't let any woman talk to me like that!
Are you sure you're okay?
What are you looking at?
I don't want to get in the middle of your marriage problems.
I'm not married to him.
He's married already, aren't you, Alan?
You lying son of a bitch.
Why don't you leave her alone?
- What did you say to me, old man?
Just leave her alone, that's all.
Don't tell me what to do.
- Okay.
I won't.
I'm not looking for any trouble.
Plenty of pretty chat down at the pub till he gets his way.
Just want to make sure the lady's okay, that's all.
Then he tells us.
- Why don't you go home, Alan?
Why don't you make me?
No.
That's not a good idea.
Can't make a man go home if he doesn't want to.
You want to stop this, Alan.
I'm going to hit you in a second and it's going to hurt.
You're going to have to lie about how you fell over 'cause you can't tell the wife about how you got hit in front of the lady's house where you've been skinning the cat.
I've warned you.
Okay?
My name's Georgina Hodge.
Nice to meet you.
Ah.
Sergeant Brookes.
Good, we get to see more of each other.
I imagine I've seen all there is to see.
Isn't that the neighbour?
What happened?
Is she going to be okay?
She's going to be okay, isn't she?
They're looking after her.
Don't worry.
Clark?
Secure the scene.
Man with a knife assaulted her.
Kitchen door was kicked in.
Fled through the front.
Sexually assaulted?
Not as far as we know.
Neighbour heard her scream.
Came down to see if they were all right.
Lone male assailant slashed her across the face as he fled.
Here, it looks like she scratched him.
Well, she says she didn't get a good look at him.
These two won't say anything.
No one else saw him?
- No.
Yeah.
Sergeant Astel.
Is that the girl's phone?
- I suppose.
While I'm talking to Kelly in the other room, call me on her phone so I can get the number.
Okay.
Kelly, I need to speak to you.
Do you think you can manage that?
Kelly, you need to talk to us so we can help you.
Now, the person who did this.
Is it someone you know?
Michelle didn't know him?
No.
I'm really scared.
Where were you?
I was here in the bedroom.
I was sleeping.
I heard her scream.
By the time I got to the lounge...
It happened so quick.
Your neighbour was able to get downstairs quicker than you could get out of your bedroom?
I told you I was sleeping.
I had to get dressed.
You can't give me any description?
No distinguishing features?
- I didn't see him.
Cole.
- It's Astel.
I'll get back to you.
Kelly, your friend's in a bad way.
Your neighbour's had her face sliced open and that's all you can tell me?
I'm gonna give you my number.
If something happens, if you change your mind, I want you to call me.
Okay.
Are we not bringing her in for questioning?
No.
Bloody stupid.
What you doing?
- See you later.
Waste of time.
Nothing here.
There must be something we can do.
She's in a really bad way.
There's nothing I can do about it.
How are we doing tonight, Mr Humby?
I hate the night shift.
You and me both, mate.
There you go.
Girl's nail with blood on it.
Nicky, I wanted to ask that favour.
Maybe it's a favour for both of us.
For the past three years I've put my name down for a CID attachment.
Carter's turned me down every time.
My face doesn't fit.
Carter and me, we're not best friends.
See, yours doesn't fit, either.
I mean, it wouldn't.
That senior officer you grassed on in London, Simmons?
He went to Hendon with Carter.
- How did you know about that?
Well, everybody knows about it.
Carter got stuck with you.
Quotas and such like, you know.
Every year Carter says he doesn't have any places.
So I'm thinking, you don't have an attachment and I'm desperate.
You really know how to sell yourself.
I've been here a long time.
I know what goes on.
I figure, you need me and I need you.
If I don't get something this year, I'm too old.
He harmed a suspect in my custody and expected me to turn a blind eye.
I take things how I see them.
If I believed what I heard, I wouldn't be standing here asking.
I'll think about it.
Mr Humby?
I want you to check something for me.
You proud of yourself?
Depends on the day.
I thought we'd have a chat.
Well, I'm not feeling great so can we keep it short and sweet, please?
I'll get you a coffee.
- Fancy a tea.
I've got enough to charge you.
I need a reason to release you.
Me personality not enough?
It's good.
But I need more.
I'm going to want something from you.
That'll be 60 quid.
Not that.
Cold?
Got the flu or something.
Sure.
Have you got nothing better to do than harass me?
I have as it happens, just not right now.
Well, it's not like there's a victim here.
Nobody does anything they don't want to do.
The victim's sitting in front of me.
Needing 60 quid so she can put it in her arm.
Look, I'm not after you.
I'm after the boys who run your gaff, threaten you, scare you and cut you up if you don't do what they say and take your money.
I'm your friend.
Yeah.
Right.
We must be friends .
You've seen me naked.
Look, I'm going to ask you to do something for me and you're gonna do it in return for me making this go away.
If we charge you, you're gonna sit in a cell going through cold turkey.
Shaking, vomiting, head pounding wishing you were dead.
That sound like fun?
Ah, please just let me go.
Or you help me and I give you some readies so you can get something for your flu.
When?
When you help me.
You can't tell me you wouldn't want to grab these guys by the short and curlies.
Think of it as payback.
Do we have a deal?
Oh yeah.
That's it, that's it.
Knock him out.
Knock him out.
Yeah, okay.
Jab, jab, jab, jab.
Is that good?
- Yeah, that's good.
That's good.
All right.
Hey, Nicky.
I've met the neighbour.
Georgina, uh, Nicky.
Hi.
- Hi.
I've been listening to him thump this thing every morning, crack of dawn.
Thought I'd have a go.
Oh, I brought some croissants over if you want one.
Oh, cheers.
- Good night?
Not sure yet.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No.
Okay, like this.
Easy, easy, easy.
Wait, wait, wait.
Take the left one.
That one?
- Yeah.
Hey, sunshine.
You're up early.
I'm just going to grab a shower then I'll walk you to school, okay?
Um, that woman gave me a kiss on my cheek.
Oh, that's tragic.
I may have to take the day off school.
Not that tragic.
She asked where my mother was.
What did you say?
None of your business.
Was that okay?
Probably not, but I love the attitude.
That's when she kissed me.
I was rude to her and she kissed me.
Yeah, women are funny.
Yeah.
Nicky?
You ready?
I'll make sure he's awake to collect you.
She's lived there 15 years.
Threw her husband out seven years ago and got the house in the divorce.
Thought you were a drug dealer when she saw your car.
Oh.
Charming.
She is.
And lively.
Who are ya?
Who are ya?
We are Fulham.
Super Fulham.
See ya.
A good day, then?
Yeah.
♪ There's only one Lee Clark
♪ One Lee Clark ♪
Right, eat your supper and go to bed early.
Early.
Remember vegetables, all right?
See you in the morning.
Bye.
He's a good boy.
- Yeah.
Forgot me keys.
I'm going to teach you a lesson, old man.
You want me to call the police?
Ah, no, it's too late for that.
Nicky!
Detective Cole.
Can I help you?
I'll explain later.
I look forward to it.
I could have taken him.
You were at Hendon, sir?
- Yes.
The DI I worked for in London was probably at Hendon same time as you.
Simmons.
Did you know him?
There were a lot of people there at the time I was.
I'll consider your request.
Mr Humby.
The DNA from the blood and the skin from under the fingernail fragment, they matched.
How did you know they would match?
Mr Humby, you are a jobsworth and I want you to have my children.
Come here.
Sir?
Patrick.
Frank.
You said you'd protect us.
He's here now.
They're going berserk.
He said he's gonna cut Tiffany.
Hurry.
Okay, let's get you out of here.
What about the money?
Come on.
Good.
Tyneside 2.
We're set and ready.
Well done, Detective.
Would this be a good time to talk about me getting off the night shift?
No.
I've checked the missing person's register.
I'm just doing a double check, making sure nothing slips through the cracks.
Yeah, anything in the last three weeks.
Adult female, late teens, early twenties.
No?
Okay, thanks very much.
We're ready when you are.
This is DS Cole.
I'm just checking on any missing persons.
Ah, course.
I'll call back during the day.
Cheers.
When somebody's missing the family usually finds us.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, I got a call from Carter.
He's considering it.
What did you say to him?
I said I needed a boy to fetch me coffee.
Said he'd like to see it as a kind of reward.
He wants me to give him something to reward.
- Yeah, he says that a lot.
A colleague told you they were fun and your name's Smith.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Okay.
I'll give you the address.
There's a gate on the side of the building.
I just don't believe it.
They seemed so nice.
She'll recognise Rick the moment he walks in.
- Yeah, I know.
Well, she won't solicit him and you haven't followed procedure.
The charge won't stick.
Yeah, I know.
The custody officer won't even hold her.
He'll just send her home.
Yeah, I know.
- If you know, why are we doing this?
She's a student.
This is a psychology lesson.
Oh, my God.
I bet you're a well brought-up girl as well.
I can't figure this one out.
- Please don't.
You're under arrest.
It was just to make extra money, just to pay the fees.
It wasn't anything.
And then this man came and said we had to work for him.
You lied to me.
- We were scared.
If our parents found out...
Lied from the start, and now your friend's in hospital because of it.
We stopped.
We told him.
Put your hands out.
That's why he hurt her .
He said we couldn't stop.
Please don't do this.
Would you be prepared to stand up in court in front of your parents and everyone else that knows you and testify against him so he goes to prison?
Sergeant Brookes.
Would you take her statement, please?

INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA, 1979
I always loved airplanes, man.
Not just toys, but real ones, too.
We lived right next to the airport.
I remember my mom would put my stroller outside while she hung clothes on the line.
My mom always told me that someday, it would be me gettin' on one of those planes goin' someplace better.
But I guess it didn't exactly work out that way.
Final boarding announcement for Worldwide Airlines Flight 119.
I'm sorry, sir.
Your dog is too big to be on the plane.
You'll have to check him.
Wait.
No.
I usually just put him in my bag.
He's not that big.
Those are the rules.
You'll have to check your dog.
Or consider taking another airline.
Come on, man.
- Can I just please--
- Russ.
I can't just...
Come on, Dre.
- Come on.
- Don't worry, sir.
- We'll take good care of him.
- Please do.
That's my little boy right there.
See you when I get off.
- Excuse me.
Thank you.
- Enjoy your flight.
Our in-flight movie will be Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, starring Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd.
Nice.
That's the sound of my gat
This is heat.
This album is fire.
Chicken or beef stroganoff?
Chicken, I'll have the chicken.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- It smells good, though.
- Chicken or beef stroganoff?
I'm gonna have the chicken.
I like the way that smelled.
That was our last chicken.
I'm afraid I just have stroganoff.
So why would you ask me what I wanted?
What's in that?
Stroganoff.
That beef strogie.
That wasn't half bad.
It was good.
Almost got a little spit on you.
- Yes, you did.
- I'm sorry.
Are you all right, sir?
Where the bathroom?
- Straight down.
- Where?
Fire in the hole.
Excuse me.
So sorry.
Come on!
Hurry.
Get in there!
Damn!
Oh, shit!
So loose.
I got it.
That's it.
No, it's not.
This is the captain speaking.
We hit some turbulence.
We ask that you return to your seats.
We've turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.
I didn't know it was gonna be like that.
I can't get out!
My ass is stuck!
Come on.
God, please, I'm a Christian.
My ass is touching' the shit.
I don't wanna die like this!
Stewardess!
There's a guy locked in the bathroom stuck on the toilet.
Press the main release discharge valve-- that should get him loose.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
!
Dre!
No!
Murderers!
You killed my dog, man.
Y'all gonna pay for this!
If I have to go on every talk show in America, y'all gonna pay!
Oprah, Ricki Lake, Dr, Phil bitch!
106th and Park.
Showtime At The Apollo.
I swear, they're gonna pay for this.
You don't treat people like this.
And that's what happened.
What exactly is your occupation, Nashawn?
- I'm an entrepreneur.
- I see.
So I guess it's fair to say you don't have a job.
No, I do--
Tell us about some of your businesses.
Any of 'em ever make any money?
- No.
- Exactly.
So it would be correct to say that you're nothin' more than a deadbeat lookin' for a quick dollar.
Right?
No further questions.
Wait!
That's not fair.
Order!
Your Honor, can I say something, please?
Be brief.
I watched my mom struggle to raise me on next to nothin', workin' for guys like you.
And I always knew that I had to make my own way, no matter what.
I might not have some fancy education or a Fortune 500 business, but I'm tryin'.
My mom always told me that you can't be successful until you try.
That's all I'm doin'.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Will the foreman please read the verdict?
Case number 077861.
Nashawn Wade vs. Worldwide Airlines, we find for the plaintiff and award him damages in the amount of $100 million.
Order!
Order!
Yo, cousin!
We did it, man!
We did it!
Yes!
What do you mean, "we"?
I didn't see your ass get stuck in no airplane toilet.
Whatever, I say we blow the first 20 mil on Rio, next 20 mil, Bangkok.
I hear they can do this thing--
Muggs, you're my cousin.
I'm not gonna forget about you, or the way you looked out for me when we was growin' up.
I'm not gonna let you convince me I'm fuckin' this money away.
You still on that strip club/daycare center thing?
Shit was genius.
Come on.
It was genius, Muggsy?
To who?
We lost all our damn money in a week.
We gonna do it straight this time, all right?
I wanna do something I can be proud of.
Whatever it is, I'm in.
There he is, Mr. Wade?
How does it feel to be the recipient of such a large reward by the court?
I mean, it feels good, ya know?
Justice has been served.
But I tell you what,
I'd trade all that money in to get back my dog Dre.
Nashawn, how's the ass?
The ass is fine, It is sittin' on $100 million,
Mr, Wade, can you tell us what you intend to do with all that money?
I'm gonna start my own airline.
No further questions.
Muggs, take care of that, please.
What is this-- BET's "How I'm Living"?
I'd like to give a shout-out to all five of my babies' mamas.
High five, Laquifa.
I'm comin', girl.
Yes, Lord!
Everybody. $100 million!
Relax.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
You the only sister.
You can't say nothin'?
What in the hell is taking her so long?
Relax, honey.
She has arthritis.
She's, like, 200 years old.
I know.
It's great.
Ready?
Go.
Mr. Hunkee?
- Yes.
- I've got good news and bad news.
The bad news is that your flight 114 to JFK has been canceled.
Oh, for the love of--
But the good news is we've been able to find another airline that can accommodate you this evening.
Would you be interested in another airline?
- Even Dad thinks you're cute.
- Get off me!
- You're such a whore.
- What did you say?
Did I stutter?
There you are.
Four tickets for flight 069 on NWA.
What you're going to want to do is go to Gate One-- that's Terminal X--and we'll send your luggage on down for you.
- Thank you for your help.
- You're quite welcome.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Don't get it greasy.
It's very expensive.
I know, I bought it.
Now, a gentleman always carries a lady's bags.
- So why are you carrying hers?
- Be kind, son.
If I play my cards right, she'll be your future mother figure.
That's scary.
Ooh, hey, sweetie.
Wait a minute.
Don't look back and not say anything.
Excuse me.
You got to move, lady.
Baby, come here.
Gimme a second.
Girl, you must not know who I am.
Nashawn Wade, baby.
I own NWA.
The boss.
Where the hell is Terminal X?
Relax, honey.
Didn't we just have a great vacation in Crackerland?
No, we didn't-- give me that stupid hat.
Leave it!
You know what would've been great?
Going to Hawaii alone.
Listen, you know the deal.
I only get to see my kids every other weekend.
Billy, where's your sister?
She's that way.
Great.
Heather, you can't just walk away from the family.
If you want to go somewhere, you gotta ask permission first.
Dad, I'm 18 years old.
Sorry.
She's 17.
You are 17.
Fine.
For a couple more hours.
I am 17, and then I'll be 18.
Then I can party and have sex.
- Sex?
!
No, no.
- Yeah, sex.
Missionary, doggie-style, rockin' the baby, gettin' tea-bagged, playin' the trombone while I'm tossin' his salad, hand jobs, ear jobs, blow jobs.
Gettin' a pearl necklace, ridin' the bologna pony...
- sucking--
- That's enough!
- Did she say bologna?
- I don't know.
...whenever I want, and best of all, I won't have to listen to you.
Can you believe that?
What came after getting tea-bagged?
Something about the trombone.
Okay, everybody, congratulations!
You guys have been punk'd!
There's cameras everywhere, right, son?
We'll be back in five minutes with the release forms.
Let's go.
Oh, shit!
Awesome!
- Terminal Malcolm X?
- Yeah.
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Usually you gotta go to two places,
- but there you get the one--
- This is a terminal?
It's great, 99 cents.
Everything.
Oh, check out the car.
This place has every-- there's a basketball court.
In your face!
Get your short ass on, you leprechaun.
Look like my ex-- short and stupid.
Everything's short.
I don't know about all that, but if Denzel walked his fine sexy ass in here right now,
I'm takin' the rest of the day off and gettin' straight down with the get down.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Girl, let me tell you, Denzel is nice, but I like the young thugs.
I love me some 50 Cent, baby.
Ooh, Shaniece.
Go, Shaniece!
It's your birthday.
We gonna party like it's your birthday.
Sip Bacardi like it's my birthday.
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not my birthday!
Look at this little nigga here.
Look more like five cent.
Nigga, can't you read?
The sign says put all metal objects in the container.
Take your ass off.
Get on back there!
Get your ass back there.
Cheap ass.
Shit goin' off 'cause that shit cheap.
That's why it's goin' off.
My flow, my show bought me the dough that bought me all my fancy things.
My cribs, my cars, my pools, my jewels.
Nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed.
Hold it!
You keep fuckin' up on my rhymes.
Move it along, nickel.
You wanna say somethin'?
!
I ain't slapped a bitch in two weeks.
Yeah, I got a whole lot of strength in the slap-a-bitch arm.
They had a whole bunch of dirty magazines--bathing suit issues.
Damn!
So you like that, huh?
You gonna love this.
Hold those for me, I won't be needing those on this flight.
Girl, what you got me--
The sweet smell of Alizé.
- Hunkee?
Elvis Hunkee?
- Yeah.
Karl Malone?
I used to play basketball with you in high school.
That's right.
We used to call you "The Paperboy."
Yeah, that was then.
I'm "The Mailman" now.
That's good.
My dad's a mailman, too.
Government jobs pay very well.
You don't understand, I play for the Lakers now.
Right, Karl.
I don't think you understand.
I used to play with you, man.
You can't shoot, remember?
That's why we never passed you the ball.
I thought it was because I was the only brother.
No, Karl.
It's 'cause you sucked!
Oh, I sucked?
What are you gonna do-- go all "postal" on me, Mr. Mailman?
My man, what's goin' on, baby?
Ah, that's nice.
That's real nice.
I'd like to be them jeans.
Make no sense.
Excuse me.
How you doin', man?
Can I get through here, sweetie?
What's goin' on, fellas?
My man.
When the buzzer pop, nigga, you stop!
Do y'all know who I am?
We don't give a damn about who you are.
Let your little ass take one more step we'll bury your ass in them fake-ass iguana shoes you're wearin'.
Ladies, it's me.
It's Nashawn Wade, owner of this airline.
Come on, remember.
I hired y'all.
- It's him.
- There ya go.
That's a little more like it.
Thought you had amnesia.
Yes, it is him!
You that little nigga got his ass caught in a toilet seat.
All right, little player, go on, take your little cute rich ass on through.
Go ahead, little player.
Bet that ass still tight, ain't it?
Shit, bitch.
I hope we don't lose our benefits over this.
We sorry, Mr. Wade!
My tooth is hurtin'.
And it's fuckin' with your breath, girl.
Upsettin' all my insides here.
Don't you say shit else for a year.
You done melted the whole side--
That's what you get for fuckin' us up.
I'll tell ya, I knew I shoulda got the new Aerostar.
Check out the safety rating.
I'm a little nervous.
I heard someone say this is the first flight for this airline.
It has five cup holders.
Honey, the FAA, they're very strict about who they let fly an airline.
It's gonna be okay, believe me.
Yeah, I know, but I think we're the only white people on the plane.
Girlfriend, like your bag.
Honey, no, we're not.
You ain't gonna pick me up?
!
Maybe it's a coincidence, you know, like a family reunion?
Million Man March?
Hey, what are you...
Hey, stop that!
Yeah, what up, son?
Yeah, yeah.
You know I'm like that.
I'm like that.
Damn.
What up?
Here's your card, Dad.
I think I melted the sucka.
Put everything on it but an Escalade.
I'm a holler at the shorty I saw at the basketball courts.
One love, dawg.
Where's my son?
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.
You doin' good?
You feel wonderful.
- Yeah.
All right.

And that's too loud for a zipper.
I don't know what you got in there, but we gonna find out.

- Come with me.
Did you hear me, boy?

I bet you ain't never seen a chocolate super-deluxe woman like me before.
Have you?
No, I got a plane to catch.
I gotta go!
Where do you think you're goin', player?
I'm gonna get on--

Now drop them drawers...

Denzel?
Look, lady.

Drop them drawers!
Show me that ass, nigga!
Now turn around.
Cavity check!
Girl, there was duct tape and peanut butter everywhere.
I told him, I don't care if you are a diplomat.
I don't bend into that position.
Girl, I ain't no circus freak.
This ain't Cirque du Soleil.
He's a fool.
Mi vida, you did the right thing.
Mi primo tried that once.
The doctors still can't find his left nut.
They say it's up there somewhere.
Give me his address.
I'll find it.
Hey, Muggsy!
Flame, not now.
Where's the pilots you hired, man?

- Who, him?
- Yeah, him.
- Right there?
- Right there.
- Him?
- Him right there?

I told you to hire a black pilot, not no black baggage handler.
What is that?
I did what you asked me to, okay?
There ain't but two black pilots around, and one of 'em flyin' for Puffy.
How'd Puffy get that one?
- Don't worry.
- You're right, I'm just nervous.
I got his resumé right there.
My dawg, what's up, baby?
What's goin' on, Muggs?
How you been?
What's up, man?
- How are you, man?
- Ain't nothin' to it but do it.
Nashawn, Captain Mack.
Captain Mack, Nashawn.
My pleasure, brother.
Hey.
You're late, man.
Don't worry about me bein' late.
I'm gonna take this hooptie of yours up another 1,000 feet, catch me a slipstream, and we gonna be there five minutes early.
Real slick like hair grease, but with less mess.
- Can you dig it?
- Hell, yeah, I can dig it.
You really gonna do that?
No, I'm just fuckin' with ya.
Y'all two know each other?
He was fuckin' with me.
Muggs, I'm really not playin' right now.
I'm not, Muggs.
I was lookin' at your resumé, man.
I see that you flew in Desert Storm.
- That's pretty impressive.
- Actually, that's a typo.
I drew over in Desert Storm.
I'm sorry.
I didn't..
what you say?
I was the nigga that drew the little sayings on the bombs:
"Fuck Iraq." "Saddam, eat a dick." That was me.
Secret agent.
Matter of fact, I ain't even 'posed to be talkin' about that.
That's classified.
What the fuck?
!
Do you even know how to fly a plane, man?
I got my wings when I got out.
Got your wings when you got out?
You right.
Plus I ain't really got another choice right now.
Where's your uniform?
You lookin' at it.
The Mackin' is crackin'.
This is how I come.
I don't wear no square suits.
I'm a player.
We ride spinners.
Ride spinners and you write on bombs.
That's classified.
I'm gonna tell you what.
Get us there safe.
Can you do that?
You something' else, Muggs.
Drew on bombs.
- Excuse me, man,
- Yes, sir.
That's about a bitch.
- Where the cockpit at?
- You got that bong?
Whole bag of it, Preach.
- I gotta go.
- Do I pay you to talk on the phone?
Look at the captain.
He is too cute.
Hi, Captain.
- At ease, ladies.
- Hi, fly boy.
I just love the look of a man in uniform.
'Course, I like the look of a man out of uniform even better.
This is some cool shit fit for a real nigga.
Hey, what's poppin', my aeronautical hustlers?
Captain Mack, reporting to duty.
How you doin'.
Captain?
I'm Riggs. your flight engineer.
Have you ever met Gaeman?
I just seen one of them fruity motherfuckers in the hallway.
Nigga was eyeballing' me.
It's Gaeman, I am Leslie Gaeman, your copilot.
What's happenin'?
It's a very prestigious African name-- not like "gay man," two men fucking together, naked,
- in a bedroom.
Not me.
- Whatever, homey.
I like pussy like you.
- I can dig it.
- Yeah, you can dig it.
Everybody will be pregnant by the end of this flight.
Hello.
First class.
Right this way, big daddy.
Welcome to NWA.
Hi.
How's everybody?
Good.
Wow, this is great!
Oh, y'all are in low class.

This is nice, too.
Dad, this actually isn't that bad.
What kind of UPN operation is this?
It's not so bad.
All right, here we are.
Row 1 7 Chrysler.
Honey, you sit here.
Thank you.
- Do I have to sit...
- How you doin'?
You're gonna have to, okay?
Thank you.
Let's please put the divider down.
Do you have an "off" switch?
You need to lower the volume.
Man, you give a black man some money, this is how the airline's gonna look--plush, laid.
It's makin' me feel sexy already.
This is a sexy plane.
They got it chromed out with the white leather.
I think this is alligator butt.
Yeah, this is nice.
Little treat for you before the plane takes off, daddy, 'cause you treat me so right.
You nasty!
Can I help you, sir?
Everything's okay, I'm just trying to find my seat,
Boy, this a nice plane.
Nice cushion they got on these new planes.
This must be one of them 777's.
7574327.
Where my seat?
777.
The president should fly on this plane.
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, baby, how you doin'?
- I'm gonna show you to your seat.
- That's nice of you, cutie pie.
- Here we are.
- Let me shake your hand.
Come here.
Oh, boy!
That's nice.
Look at that.
Boy, I can just hear everything.
It's so beautiful in here.
Wait a minute.
Somebody got some nice perfume on.
Is that Victoria Don't Tell Nobody?
- No.
- Is that Boujeronee?
Not Boujeronee either.
I like the people that don't talk back.
Hard to get, I like that.
Cabin attendant?
Yes, sir?
Howdy do.
Where are you, baby?
There you are.
Get me a quadruple cognac and a cola back.
You know, I'm scared to fly.
I'm used to riding' buses.
My little nephew sent me on first class, because I'm a player.
You smell good, too.
I'm gonna have me some fun on this plane here.
Okey-dokey.
So you're gonna be in...
You're gonna go ahead to low class, okay.

- No way.
My God, what's going on?
Get the fuck out!
What is he doing?
Watch him.
Y'all better get his ass!
You ain't goin' nowhere without us, Osama.

We got this.
We security up in here.
Look straight.
- Hi.
- Hey.
This first class is incredible.
Girl, this plane is off the hook.
Have you seen the owner?
He's young, black, and from the pictures I've seen, he looks so good.
I'm sure he's great.
- And he's paid.
- Please direct your attention to the screen in front of you for a safety video.
What is this?
Now that you got on our plane and you be listenin'
You better just do as we say or you'll be missin'
Better put your seatbelt on or you'll be dyin'
If the plane goes crazy, then you will not be flyin'
Now we direct you to the nearest locations
Where you might desire to exit your vacations
If we lose the pressure, you'll be chokin'
Or if there's a fire, then you'll be smokin'
The oxygen we will be providin'
This some black shit here.
You're a survivor
- Here we go.
- There we go.
You're a survivor, you'll keep on flyin'
You're a survivor, you don't go down there
Honey, what is this?
You're a survivor, you not be dyin'

You're a survivor, you don't go down there
You're a survivor, you got your fair share
You're a survivor
Whoo, you're a survivor
There's the owner right there.
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to NWA Airlines.
Here at NWA, safety is a very important part of flying, but let's be real.
If something goes wrong, we're all going down, right?
Is that supposed to be funny?
I'm just kiddin'--I'm playin'.
That's why it's our policy that fun comes first.
So please, sit back, relax, and enjoy your flight.
You're a survivor.
You are.
Come on, now, stop it.
You got a brother feelin' like the president.
God bless America.
Giselle?
I gotta get outta here.
Giselle, wait.
Giselle, can you wait a minute, please?
What, Nashawn?
What do we possibly have to talk about?
Wow, I mean, you look great.
How you been?
I've been fine.
Just fine.
Is that all?
Actually, no, I mean.
I was doin' some thinkin'.
and I wanna talk to you.
Can I at least talk to you?
Giselle, where you gonna go?
The door is closed.
What's this?
Someone stepped up, Nashawn.
I'm engaged.
Hey, baby.
It's not a good time right now.
There's no easy way for me... for me to say this...
What?
This isn't workin' for me anymore.
What's not workin'?
- This is gettin' way too serious.
- What are you talkin' about?
I can't do this anymore.
- I can't.
- No.
You got change of a 50, man?
- Not right now, Muggs.
- Not now?
What's his problem, man?
Oh, boy.
Hey, hey, there, Blanca.
I was wondering if I could trouble you for a drink.
Ain't no drink down there.
Hell there ain't.
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I speak a little Español.
Really?
Testicles, one, two.
Hey, y'all, what's crackalackin'?
This is your soul plane chauffeur, Captain Antoine Mack speaking.
He sounds nice.
Welcome aboard NWA flight 069 from the 310 to the 212.
It's time to bust this corner, y'all.
In a hot second,
I'll be hittin' them switches and gettin' this bitch pumping' and jumpin'.
What?
!
So screw your shit on tight and enjoy the flight.
What did he say?
He was just saying that we'll be leaving in a couple of seconds, so put your seatbelt on, make sure they're tight.
Amateurs.
- Why didn't he say so?
- Exactly.
Yo, Gaeman, why don't you go secure the cockpit, homey?
Yes.
Right away.
This motherfucker is locked.
Fred G. Sanford, my nigga.
And the "G" is for goin' places.
Can you dig it?
Now we ready to roll.
Nigga got switches in this motherfucker.
Shit.
And they work.
What?
This motherfucker hot, cuz.
- Oh, my God!
- Bounce with me.
This motherfucker's fucked up.
- Like a elephant.
- Yeah.
Bounce, bounce.
I have the perfect music for this.
Yes, I have it right here.
Hey, man, hold on, man.
- Hold the fuck on.
- Like elephant.
No, man, you gotta turn that bullshit off.
We can't be ridin' to that bullshit, man.
Don't insult my music.
We ridin' to some gangsta shit.
Pop that in, man.
Captain don't wanna hear that Zimbabwe ah-wah-wah shit.
Get that shit out.
Get it the fuck outta here.
I'm the captain of this motherfuckin' ship.
Captain, what the hell is wrong with you?
Man, I'm afraid of heights.
Afraid of heights?
!
Hit her with a bat, hit her with a bat
Hit her with a whoo-whoo
- Easy, Kobe.
She's 17.
- Dad, I'm 18.
Honey, I'm gonna excuse myself
- and go to the restroom.
- Okay.
I think I'm gonna go check out the plane.
Is that all right?
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Stay for a while.
Oh, my sweet black Jesus!
Hey, good evenin'.
I didn't know anybody was in here.
- I'll come back later.
- Why?
I'm still gonna be here.
I tell you what.
You take care of your business, I take care of mine.
I just don't feel comfortable, I'll just hold it.
You don't want to do that.
That stuff back up on you, top of your head fly clean off.
Sit down, make yourself at home.
I'm sorry.
We don't get that many of y'all on the plane.
For those with no junk in their trunk.
That is a nice vest.
I ain't seen one of them since Lionel and the Jeffersons.
What ever happened to Lionel?
I thought he was--
Would you mind?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Little fella kinda shy?
Goddamn!
Sorry.
I guess you can't have lightnin' without the thunder.
Somebody still likes that pork, I see.
I think this was a false alarm.
I'm gonna go back to my seat.
The paint is peeling.
That must be a big one.
Yeah, it's big.
I've got just the thing.
I can't believe that this is you.
So you subscribe to "Black Proud"?
This is the first time I've picked it up.
Yeah, it was freezin' that day.
Really?
You could never tell that from the picture.
Why, thank you.
Usually, the problem is, I'm hangin' out the bottom of my boxers.
Oh, my goodness.
Hi.
I think you're in my seat.
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Jerome.
Hi.
Hello.
Jerome was telling me about how he hangs out the bottom of his boxers.
That's nice.
They're about to serve dinner, so you might want to go back to your chair.
Oh, yeah.
You're right.
Yeah.
It was nice meetin' you.
It was nice meeting you, too, Barbara.
Nice meeting you, too, Jerome.
Bye.
Hangin' out the bottom of his boxers--
My God, is that him?
!
- That thing has a face on it,
- No, but it's gonna.
Are you all right, sir?
Course, I'm all right, I'm a G, ain't I?
I will make the announcement.
No, you won't.
Give me this motherfucker.
I'm makin' the announcement.
I'm the captain.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our cruising altitude of 33,000 feet,
33,000 feet?
!
Oh, shit, man.
We fuckin' higher than Redman at the Source awards.
Shit don't make no motherfuckin' sense to be this high, cuz.
Man, I feel sick.
Oh, fuck.
Ain't this some shit?
What the hell's goin' on here?
This nigga's afraid of heights.
How you gonna be afraid of heights if you the captain?
I ain't never been off the ground before.
We've flown computer simulators.
You told me you got your wings when you got out the Air Force.
No, I didn't.
I told you I got my wings when I got out.
When I got out of Pelican Bay State Corrections Facility.
It was either get a GED or take a pilot class.
You learned how to fly in the prison?
Hey, man, don't get mad 'cause I spent your money to get a good education.
Shit, me and my homeboys passed the class with flying colors.
Let me see.
- I miss them niggas, man.
- Those are his niggas.
The Taliban.
I'm gonna tell you what.
Y'all better fix it.
Gay-man, Captain Mack--
It's Gaeman!
I don't give a damn.
Fix it.
I'm no bitch, you understand?
It's Gaeman.
You gonna be a gay man.
Fix it.
Put this shit on autopilot.
I'm goin' to the lavatory.
I got to boo-boo.
- What ya doin'?
- I'm countin' my tips.
- Tips from where?
- Back there,
...low class motherfucker.
Hey, nigga!
Oh, boss man.
Hey, man, you mind if I get in here?
Come on.
Hold on.
Got a new shooter.
- One shot, baby, you in?
- No.
Nigga, is ya in?
What?
- You said I could run business class, right?
- Yeah, I did.
So I'm runnin' this motherfucker like Vegas on fight night.
We got a cockfight we setting' up in ten minutes.
Cockfight?
!
I'm in.
No.
Let me tell you over here.
I don't even want everybody in my business.
Hold me down.
- What's up, cuz?
- You know what?
I'm not even gonna make a scene in here.
I'm goin' back to the front of the plane.
When I get back here, I want this to be business class.
- Okay.
You got it, man.
- You can do that for me?
My man.
Thank you, Muggs.
Would you like champagne or wine?
We'll have champagne.
Would you like Moet or Cristal?
Motit...et.
Moet.
All right.
I know you have a drinking problem, so please drink slow.
That's for you.
And sir, please don't swallow your ice.
That's all I can afford to give you.
Hello.
Would you like Colt .45
or Alizé?
Maybe you could explain to us what those are.
My pleasure, sir.
Colt .45 tastes like liquored-up beer, and it sneaks up on you all of a sudden.
And Alizé--oh, that's my favorite.
It's from France.
It's a cog-nac, it's very fruity, and it'll make you wanna do the hucklebuck, then pass out in your own juices.
Guess I'll have that.
Wise choice.
Yo, player, you got a little somethin'-somethin' for me?
Yeah, I have a shorty 40.
No, no.
Do you have any whole milk?
Sir, that is nasty.
I do have a Puerto Rican lady who's lactating', I'll see what I can do.
Tonight, we're serving a plate of gourmet soul food with your choice of lobster and filet mignon or crisp duck confit,
I'll have the filet,
And for you, sir?
I ordered a special Kosher meal... yag-weh.
Excuse me?
That's fried chicken in hot sauce.
Lobster, filet mignon or duck?
I'll take the fee-lan.
All right, I need you to take a breast or a leg and a wing and pass it back.
Exactly.
You guys, share your napkins with your neighbor.
One for every two people.
Sharing is caring.
Don't get greedy.
One piece.
Hi.
Would you like some dessert?
Boss man, low class is outta liquor, so I thought I would come in here and...
Someone is strolling' down memory lane.
No, I'm just, you know, checkin' on things, makin' sure they okay, that's all.
Yeah, right.
I know that look.
I had that same look of regret after I ran into Lee-- my little Asian butterfly.
We had a whirlwind romance that ended in heartbreak... and stomach pumping'.
When I saw him again, I tried to apologize, but I couldn't.
I just felt so bad leaving him in that hospital all bloated and distended.
Did you just grind on me?
A little.
What does that sick-ass story have to do with me?
I've never left nobody in the hospital filled with nothin'.
It means, Mr. Righteous, that if you have a chance to make things right again, you should take it.
Who knows what could've happened?
Lee had plenty ancient secret to show me.
Thank you.
Flame.
Okay?
You're welcome.
Now, how much Colt .45
to Sierra Mist do you mix to get bubbly?
Probably half and half.
You mind if I sit down?
It's your plane.
It really doesn't have to be like this.
How is it supposed to be?
So who's this guy?
Let's just let it go, okay?
I just came over here to talk to you.
You just disappeared.
I didn't even hear from you.
Giselle, you were 3,000 miles away.
I tried to get in touch with you.
Let's just let it go.
I don't know what smells better-- this meal or your delightful perfume.
Thank you.
You're too kind.
You know, a lot of smart women find blind men sexy.
- You know why?
- No.
But I'm sure you're about to tell me.
When you lose one sense, it makes your other senses stronger,
I have more of a sensitive touch than the average man,
Please!
Let me tell you about this love I had,
She was on the trampoline, landed right in my lap.
Bang!
She stayed there for 1 5 years.
People crazy about me.
People love me.
- You don't say.
- Don't say?
I do say it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
People love me.
See these fingers here?
These fingers got eyes on 'em just like 20/20 vision.
You know what I mean?
They... wait a minute.
Move that other leg out the way.
Move that dress up, girl.
Oh, boy, moist.
You just as tender as you can be.
You a little frisky thing.
You got a little puddle here.
Oh, you big, too.
You ain't no baby.
This is wonderful.
I love freaky stuff like this.
Just let yourself go.
I'm gonna let myself go, too.
I'm feelin' something, too.
This ain't like me.
I don't usually go this quick.
I'm goin' now.
Let me tell you.
Where my yack?
I'm a player... player!
- Hey, now.
- Oh, excuse me,
No, it's cool, I'm the attendant,
You can sit this one out, my brother.
I'm just gonna wash my hands.
Got me a wild woman sitting' next to me and look what I got.
Bang!
Stinky pinky.
Stinky pinky, here you go.
Hey, brother.
I ain't washin' that one, I'm washin' this one.
She using' cilantro.
I love that freaky shit.
The only way you got stinky pinky is if you was sittin' next to Miss Potato Head.
There's always some dude who's a player hater 'cause he ain't gettin' none.
Just 'cause you blind don't mean I won't whip your ass.
Lookin' like a disco lemon.
Son of a bitch!
All right, you suit-and-tie-wearin' motherfuckers.
A little green gets you in between.
The more dough, the more they show.
Now, a true player is a payer, am I right?
That's what's up.
We don't park collars at NWA--we park dollars.
You heard me?
If you can afford business class, you can afford some business ass.
Hey, Muggs, what's goin' on?
- Where?
- Here.
- Here.
What is this?
- It's all good up in here, baby.
We got Asian persuasion, butter pecan freakin', chocolate deluxe.
I got it all in my little shopping mall.
What is it you're not gettin'?
First gambling', now this?
It's illegal, man.
You with the FAA, nigga?
- No.
What are you talkin' about?
- Ain't no rules in the air.
Listen to me.
That's not the point, man.
It's a family airline.
You got ladies up in here?
I sure do!
Listen to me.
We not in the 'hood no more.
Hey, Nashawn.
Hey!
What's this about?
The girls just wanted to show their appreciation for everything you've done.
If you stick around for a minute.
I'm sure it'd make the ladies very, very happy.
Start with this.
Just like that?
You're so sexy.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Back up.
Oh, my God!
Hey, move, devil.
Get it together and get it fast.
You got to get off the pole.
Hey, baby, watch your step.
Hey.
I guess there are some things you can commit to.
You talkin' 'bout this?
I'm just doin' my job, that's all.
Yeah, it looks like you're a workaholic.
And here I was thinkin' I was too hard on you before.
Guess you're the man now.
Wait, Giselle.
What the fuck am I doin'?
!
You ready for this?
- Yeah.
- You ready?
Oh, yeah, daddy.
- You sure?
- Wait.
Don't fight the feelin', baby.
What the hell is you doin' in here?
That's the problem with you young cats.
You talk too much.
- A woman like that...
- You do talk a lot.
...wants a man of action.
I was wonderin' if you can help my friend Ben here.
He needs you to take him back to his seat.
Yeah, Ben, I believe I know where this cat is sittin'.
Dig this here.
You don't need a lot of space.
Superman changed in a phone booth.
Hey, don't be...
man, don't be touchin'...
Tidy Bowl man.
We gonna need this right here.
- Ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, what the hell is this?
I seen this on an episode of "Real Sex".
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.
All you gotta do is have a safety word.
You got one?
Yeah, when I say.
"Get off me, you crazy bitch", you stop choking' me.
Ow!
Shit!
Actually, I wish you'd stop smacking' me.
You like it.
- It's tight.
- It's supposed to be tight.
That's why you buy me the good shit.
The belt is too damn tight!
Stop your bitch-ass complainin' and give me what you promised.
I can't feel my toes!
I can't feel your dick, but I ain't complaining'.
D.J., please, don't stop.
Five more seconds.
Cheese, eggs, grits, chilies, yams, sunflower seeds.
No.
No!
No?
Man, this is not the way it happened on "Real Sex".
This is some real bullshit.
It was probably the turbulence and all the excituration of the moment, 'cause I used--
You see that, David.
Did you see that, David?
Why you always got to go--
I need to spank you with the bad...
I'm gonna punish him.
This motherfuckin' autopilot shit is cool as hell, man.
Just kick back and ride and glide.
Relax, motherfucker.
I should be captain of this plane.
Ten years with Chuku Airlines.
Chuku Airlines, where we treat you with a lot of respect.
This motherfucker.
Now I'm here with this nigga.
Nigga, shut the fuck up with that African mumbo-jumbo bullshit.
I hear you over there with that Chuku Airlines shit.
You with NWA Airlines, I'm the captain.
- I don't care.
- Real niggas drive real shit.
I should kill you.
We have a birthday girl, Captain.
This is Heather Hunkee.
She wanted to see our cockpit.
How old are you, Heather?
I just turned 18.
Is that right?
Oh, boy.
Attention, all players.
The upper deck will be open for your enjoyment.
We have a passenger who just turned 18 years old.
Her name is Heather Hunkee.
She is one cute little hottie with a whole lotta body.
Oh, yeah.
She'll be upstairs, so all players come up and keep her company.
No!
Hey, Virgie, how are you?
Good to see you.
Yeah, I know.
It's hot, right?
This is hot.
Let me take you to the bar.
Give me your jacket, girl.
Big Boy!
All my pimps, players, and hustlers-- y'all ready to set this motherfucker off, West Coast style?
As you see, we up in the clouds.
Got a gang of lovely ladies out there on the dance floor ready to go ahead and shake that ass and get they freak on.
To my fellas out there who ain't got no game-- yeah, I'm talkin' to you.
Don't even trip on it, 'cause we ain't goin' nowhere.
We locked in this bitch for four more hours till we touch down, so you might as well go ahead and get your swerve on.
- Marshall, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.
This is Heather.
She's turnin' 18 today.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Captain Mack is buyin' her her first drink.
What can I get for you?
Surprise me.
I got just what you need.
Girl, he is cute!
I know.
He's a looker.
He'll hook you up.
Cool!
All right, have a good time.
I gotta go back downstairs.
Keep an eye on her.
Oh, I will.
Not that kind of eye.
It's Big Boy.
What's goin' down, y'all?
We gonna keep this motherfucker crackin' until everybody in here pass the fuck out.
Yeah, this is my joint right here.
- Who'd you come here with?
- Don't worry about that.
- Please, Captain, I just--
- Hey, nigga!
What part of "you ain't flyin' this motherfuckin' plane"
don't you understand?
Sit back and enjoy the ride, Idi Amin.
What are you doing?
You fool!
Any motherfuckin' dry ass mushrooms of yours ain't gettin' me high no motherfuckin' way.
You need to fuck with the white boys.
They shit potent.
White boys, American shit.
This is African mushrooms, very dangerous.
They can kill you!
You ate 15 of them!
These are topical, for the skin.
I crush them up, and I put them for my itching.
Motherfucker, you got crabs?
!
This man got crabs.
You ain't sitting' in the pilot's seat for sure.
Ha ha, keep laughing.
It's not funny.
African crab is very aggressive.
They hunt us.
They can kill you.
That motherfucker is crazy as fuck, man.
They dangerous, and they kill you.
Fuck!
That Gaeman!
Excuse me.
Motherfucker, did you just touch me?
Yeah, I wanna get up in the club.
- You on the list?
- What list?
The goddamn guest list.
- Are you on it?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
What's your name?
Elvis Hunkee.
I wouldn't even have wrote no shit down like that, homey.
Maybe it's under The King, 'cause my friends, they call me "The King".
It's my nickname.
I ain't your friend, and you ain't no king, motherfucker.
Right.
Move!
I'm talkin' to you.
What's up?
Go right in.
All right, put 'em up.
It's go time.
It's definitely go time, motherfucker.
You about to get the best damn ass-whippin'.
I hope the little bitch you're lookin' for is worth dyin' for.
She is, 'cause that little bitch is my daughter.
Your daughter?
Why didn't you say that shit, man?
I got five daughters, man.
The little one, Trina, every time I see her.
she just runs into my arms, like, "Daddy.
Daddy!"
We have little tea parties and shit.
The little cups, and I put the little hat on.
Little table, man.
It was so beautiful.
My heart would, like, explode.
Yeah, I need to go upstairs.
- I miss my babies.
- I miss mine, too.
She's upstairs.
I never see them.
I'm always busy securing' shit.
- Honest living.
- I never see 'em, dawg.
Secure your shit.
Secure your shit.
Go get your girl, man.
Go get your little girl.
Take care of your family, man!
Who's on the list?
Yo, Captain.
I got to go drain the monster.
What the hell's taking Gay-man so long?
I don't know, I ain't his mama.
Matter of fact, why don't you page him and tell him to bring his bitch ass up here 911.
Attention, Gay-man.
Attention, Gay-man, I have to go drain the monster.
Return to the cockpit immediately.
Man, I wouldn't answer that shit if I was you, homey.
Shake it up real fast then stop
Shake it up real fast then drop
Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a 18-wheeler
That... fine, but this... killer
Leakin', she soaking' wet
- Muggsy, what are you doin'?

Who the hell said cut?
Yeah.
Who the hell said cut?
The director says cut.
Damn!
Look, Nashawn.
I already know, dawg.
Come here.
Is that the Ying Yang Twins?
Yeah.
Watch out.
Ying Yang Twins!
What's up, baby?
Don't drink gasoline.
We got a bar.
I had a gold tooth.
I shoulda kept it for this.
Why y'all stop rollin'?
'Cause you came in.
No, don't stop on account of me, I'm the owner.
Nashawn Wade--that's me.
I'm the boss of this.
- Hey, roll camera!
- Who said roll camera?
I say roll camera.
- That's my job.
- That's his job.
Chris, I'm tellin' ya, we need more sexy in this video.
Let's go, Tamika.
Get in there.
This cool?
- Yes, sir.
- Tamika, let's get in there.
Get on in there, girl.
Yo, Chris, I'm tellin' ya, man.
We need more ass in this video, and it'd be off the hook.
Yo, Muggsy, who is this kid?
Roll camera.
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.
Lil' John back there.
Shake it like a salt shaker!
Can I get a glass of Hypno with some ice, please?
- Coming right up.
- What you doin' by yourself?
- Go have a good time.
- No, thanks.
- You okay?
- No.
So what's goin' on?
My son Billy--he doesn't want to be anything like me.
He says I got no flavor.
My daughter Heather-- she's growin' up so fast.
It seems like yesterday I was teachin' her to ride a bike.
Now she's out there...
Hey, what is tea-bagging?
That's the shit!
That's where you take your balls and dip 'em in a freak mouth.
you keep goin' up and down like...
- Then you dip, right.
- I got it.
Thank you.
I got a little carried away.
Gettin' back on the subject-- you raise your kids right, eventually they gonna wanna move on and find they own path.
You're probably right.
You're a lucky man, Nashawn.
I wouldn't say that.
It took me gettin' everything I ever wanted to realize I lost the best thing I ever had.
What was her name?
- Giselle.
- That's a beautiful name.
Bet she's beautiful.
Very.
Very!
Still love her?
Course I do.
Then go do somethin' about it.
Listen, when I met my Barbara.
I knew that moment I'd move heaven and earth to be with her.
I knew that she was worth it.
So you happy now?
Not really.
Last time I saw her, she was with this tall model type.
A real handsome black guy?
Yeah.
Sittin' in low class?
Yeah.
Got a dick like a fire hose?
Yeah.
Yeah, you lost her.
- Can he get another one?
- Double.
Have you talked to her?
She can't talk.
She must have vocal cord damage.
I can believe it.
Man, if my baby mama page me one more time, I swear to God...
What she want?
This motherfuckin' bitch wants some more child support money 'cause she heard I got this job.
I can't believe these hos nowadays.
She extorting' you?
That's messed up, man.
But you know what?
If I crash this motherfucker into a mountain right now, the bitch can't get shit from me.
Watch this.
Oh, shit!
Shit, my nigga!
Oh, shit!
Hold on, cuz!
- Oh, shit!
- Here we go.
That shit was funny as hell.
I know they trippin' off this shit in the back.
You fuckin' high, dawg.
You startin' to scare me now.
Here ya go.
I'm gonna bounce before Gay-dude and Riggs come back.
All right, my nigga.
I'm put this bitch on autopilot so I can enjoy myself.
Captain Mack need to kick back and enjoy this motherfuckin' situation.
Oh, shit.
Last mushroom.
Might as well go on and take this to the head.
Dry-ass mushroom, African motherfucker.
Here you are, sir.
Oh, hey, that's my dad.
I need to talk to him.
Hi, Daddy.
Happy birthday, Heather.
You mad at me?
No, Actually, I'm just glad to hear you call me daddy for a change,
It's been a while,
Usually it's shithead or asshole or something,
I'm sorry.
It's just I hate that you're with Boobra.
Barbara... and I are not together anymore.
I'm still upset that you and Mom aren't together.
I'm sorry about that, honey.
But your mom's with Dorothy now.
I'd like to be with your mom.
Hell, I'd love to be with your mom and Dorothy.
But that's not important.
What's important is that you know that I'm your dad, and whether you're 18 or 48 or 88, I'm gonna still protect you because I love you.
I love you, too, Daddy.
I'll always be your little girl.
Right.
I will.
What about all that stuff tonight?
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't do anything.
Really?
I was just saying stuff to get you mad.
I don't even know what half that stuff is.
What's tea-bagging anyway?
That's when you get down on top...
Dad!
Apparently, it's the shit.
Come here.
So can I have another blow job?
It's a drink.
It's cool.
Look, baby.
I'm sorry, and I wants to make it up to you.
Don't get it started because you know you're not gonna finish.
Why you bringin' up old shit?
Let me see them tits!
Okay, okay!
What's the plan?
Hold on one second.
I'm fixin' to be right back.
Good evening, Cap.
Is it cool if I come in?
This is tight up in here, dawg.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush, man.
I'll get straight to the point.
Me and my girl--we overly ambitious members of the mile-high club.
I was wondering if you would let us come in here, and, we could, like, do it.
All right, cool.
I'm fixin' to get her.
You probably gonna see her titties and everything, man.
I'll be right back, dawg.
Hey, this is my girl.
Hi, Captain.
I know you got stuff to do, so we just gonna do our thing, man.
Yeah, it's cool.
Okay, okay.
No, no.
Ain't that my game.
Ooh, yeah.
I like the way you doin' that.
Ooh, work it, daddy.
I'm tryin', but it's like a sauna down here,
It's like a fire,
- How's that?
- Oh, it's good, daddy.
You the king.
Tastes like chocolate puddin'.
Gots to have you right now.
- Got to have you right now, girl!
- Nasty fool!
Oh, shit.
That nigga dead!
He dead!
Get your ass off me!
He's dead!
This nigga's dead!
This nigga's dead!
The captain is dead!
Pork chop grease.
I'll take care of it.
The captain's dead!
That's our motto:
we fly, we party, we land.
That's what we tryin' to do, man.
Nashawn, we gotta talk.
I want to talk to you, too.
The captain is dead.
Dead?
Wait a minute.
Are we talkin' Tupac dead.
like maybe he is or maybe he isn't, or Wilt Chamberlain dead, like he ain't checkin' back in the game?
Dead like he can't fly this plane, dead.
People are freakin' out.
It's Muggsy hiring' these prison pilots.
You know what.
That's what we got a copilot for.
All we gotta do is find Gaeman, because I hired him.
He's a professional, and we should be cool.
Yes, counterclockwise.
Move your ass, baby.
Don't forget to squeeze my nipple like a cow.
Would you like to see my African walking stick?
Hey, hey, Gaeman.
Oh, my God.
Move over!
How are you, sir?
I was taking a bath, I was dirty.
You are clean now, ladies.
I got an emergency, I need you to fly the plane.
The plane?
Yeah.
- Me?
Fly the plane?
- Yes.
Oh, my God!
I get to fly.
They will have a parade!
Go, Gaeman!
Move out the way!
Move, you bitches!
I have to fly the plane.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, shit!
He fell hard.
Gaeman!
God damn!
What the hell am I supposed to do now?
You're gonna find some way to land this plane.
Meet me in the cockpit, okay?
- Meet you?
- In the cockpit.
I got one more left.
Here you go.
You gotta pull one of these damn cords.
I don't want this shit, man.
I'm responsible for these people.
I gotta try something.
Fuck them.
What are you, sick?
I know you, all right?
You can't even ride a bike.
How do you expect to land this thing?
It don't even--
It don't even matter.
I'm not runnin' out like I always do.
I'm gonna face this shit.
If you wanna go, go.
If you goin', go.
You gotta pull this one.
Hey, don't be grabbin' my cord.
You gonna make my chute ejaculate prematurely,
Baby, watch your head.
Don't let that touch you.
- I got a dead pilot, man.
- Just go.
God damn!
Oh, my God!
Not like this.
Listen, Giselle...
in case something happens, there's something I need to get off my chest.
That night when you and I broke up.
I was on your porch.
I overheard you and your father arguing about college.
What do you mean, you're not goin' away to college?
It's too far, I want to stay here where Nashawn is.
You gotta go, I been waitin' 18 years for this day to have the house to myself.
I'm not going.
You always dreamed of going to NYU.
Now they're offering you a full scholarship.
You tellin' me you're not goin' because of some little poop butt ass nigga who can't even keep a job!
Dad, I'm sorry, but I can't leave Nashawn.
I love him and he loves me.
You are going to college.
You're not messin' up my plans.
I didn't want you to throw all that away because of me.
I can get $200 a month for that room.
I just want you to know that I'm sorry, Giselle.
- Hey, baby.
- I'm so sorry for hurting you.
Leaving you was the biggest mistake of my life.
For what it's worth...
I never stopped loving you.
You better get in there.
You got a plane to land.
Yeah.
Cool.
I'm cool.
I got it.
I got it right now.
Mayday.
SOS.
I said SOS.
Come down, selecta.
- Nashawn!
- What?
Are you gonna cut a demo or radio in?
I don't know what to say.
I got something.
Hello?
This is Nashawn Wade, owner of NWA Airlines.
Yes, sir, the black one.
No, don't hang up.
Hello?
Can you please help us?
We got a situation here.
My pilot died, and I got people on the back of my plane asking for help and--hello?
They put me on hold.
Due to the high number of calls, your estimated wait time
- is 45 minutes.
- What are you doing here?
We family, man.
We was in this from the beginning, we gonna ride this out to the end.
That's my nigga, man.
Look at my watch.
What's up, G?
Excuse me.
I represent three of the four white people on board.
I want to tell you fellas we are behind you 100%.
What?
Hunkee, please.
I'm just here to find the little black box so I can wrap my big, black ass around it.
If I have to ride that tiny, indestructible motherfucker 30,000 feet to safety, trust you'll hear bitch screamin'.
"Hi ho, Silver".
Where's the box?
I really want to thank y'all for giving me all this confidence.
- I really feel it, I do.
- You're welcome.
Somebody knows how to land this plane, this would be the time to speak.
I saw a show on the Discovery channel, but that was about motorcycles.
Take control of the plane.
What?
You have to disengage the autopilot.
How do you know that?
I used to date this pilot, and we would make love in the cockpit.
You haven't had an orgasm until you've had it during descent.
Bitch, can you land this plane?
Show me where it is, Blanca.
What is it?
I don't remember.
That's what I told you...
I need you to go to the back then.
No, hold on.
Last time I was here...
Here, here!
There it is.
Push it.
Somebody help her.
Okay, I gotta grab it.
Guess I had a little control right away.
I'm flyin', y'all.
Okay, what's next, Blanca?
I would...
Yes, the flaps!
The flaps!
Adjusting the flaps.
What's next?
I think it was... the trim.
I cannot hear her.
I got it.
I see what you're sayin'.
What's next?
I don't know.
This is where he usually pops the cork.
We are so fucked!
Don't panic, please.
You're gonna be okay.
You can't use that phone while we're on the plane.
Girl, please, they say that to rip you off.
They want you to use their phone.
- I am calling for some help.
- No, I'm telling you.
Don't be hardheaded.
Don't use that phone.
Fuck that!
Okay.
All right.
We back on track right now.
What next, Blanca?
The wheels.
Muggsy, pull the wheels down.
Grab the wheel and do it slow.
I feel it comin' down, y'all,
Oh, yes!
Oh, D.J., this is it!
It's gonna happen this time, baby.
We about to die, you got me tied up down here.
Damn it, I don't give a fuck.
We goin' to heaven with one last nut.
Nigga, stay focused!
Yeah!
I'm doin' it!
I told you it was the turbulence.
You don't want none of this.
Here we go.
We gonna land.
New York, here we go!
This is it right here.
That's the ground!
We made it.
We gonna live.
I did it.
We down.
You did it!
That's just what you do, cousin.
Exactly what I do!
You see what I'm sayin'?
I was so scared.
You crazy bitch!
Fuck this airline!
You know what, she was on the way out anyway.
- Forget her, baby.
You did it.
- I did.
Yeah, I can do that.
All right, y'all with the mushy stuff.
I'm a go check on the passengers.
- Y'all just too cute.
- My boy.
Maybe we should go, too.
We should check on 'em, too.
All right.
Come on.
What a day.
Wait a minute.
Hold that, sugar dumpling'.
I don't know what smells better-- the New York air or your magnificent perfume.
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.
Wait a minute.
That's an Adam's apple.
I'm a player, but I don't play that way.
Floor walker!
No, I...
- Hey, Muggs.
- Yo, cousin.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
We made it!
What kind of shit-- this is Central Park.
Where is Central Park?
It's in New York, ain't it?
You got JFK, LaGuardia, Newark--
What you need an airport for, you got all this grass?
Ain't this a bitch?
This nigga is pissin' on the plane!
That's your problem.
You always thinkin' on the nega--
Hell, no, I know they didn't just steal my damn rims.
That's what your punk ass get.
You know how hard it is to get 84-inch rims?
That's a big-ass tire for a little-ass plane and a short-ass nigga.
Why don't you go put a doughnut in your mouth?
I am going to sue your ass, I am gonna sue the airline...
That's all you do is complain.
It doesn't matter, I'm not gonna let you spoil this for me.
I tell you what, Muggs, take everybody upstairs.
Drinks on me.
Let's party!
And we did party.
Just like I told y'all-- we fly, we party and we land.
Pop, where'd you get the moves from?
Where do ya think you got 'em from, son?
Wow!
This is the bomb!
What?
What did I say?
Let's dance!
INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA, 1979
I always loved airplanes, man.
Not just toys, but real ones, too.
We lived right next to the airport.
I remember my mom would put my stroller outside while she hung clothes on the line.
My mom always told me that someday, it would be me gettin' on one of those planes goin' someplace better.
But I guess it didn't exactly work out that way.
Final boarding announcement for Worldwide Airlines Flight 119.
I'm sorry, sir.
Your dog is too big to be on the plane.
You'll have to check him.
Wait.
No.
I usually just put him in my bag.
He's not that big.
Those are the rules.
You'll have to check your dog.
Or consider taking another airline.
Come on, man.
- Can I just please--
- Russ.
I can't just...
Come on, Dre.
- Come on.
- Don't worry, sir.
- We'll take good care of him.
- Please do.
That's my little boy right there.
See you when I get off.
- Excuse me.
Thank you.
- Enjoy your flight.
Our in-flight movie will be Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, starring Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd.
Nice.
That's the sound of my gat
This is heat.
This album is fire.
Chicken or beef stroganoff?
Chicken, I'll have the chicken.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- It smells good, though.
- Chicken or beef stroganoff?
I'm gonna have the chicken.
I like the way that smelled.
That was our last chicken.
I'm afraid I just have stroganoff.
So why would you ask me what I wanted?
What's in that?
Stroganoff.
That beef strogie.
That wasn't half bad.
It was good.
Almost got a little spit on you.
- Yes, you did.
- I'm sorry.
Are you all right, sir?
Where the bathroom?
- Straight down.
- Where?
Fire in the hole.
Excuse me.
So sorry.
Come on!
Hurry.
Get in there!
Damn!
Oh, shit!
So loose.
I got it.
That's it.
No, it's not.
This is the captain speaking.
We hit some turbulence.
We ask that you return to your seats.
We've turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.
I didn't know it was gonna be like that.
I can't get out!
My ass is stuck!
Come on.
God, please, I'm a Christian.
My ass is touching' the shit.
I don't wanna die like this!
Stewardess!
There's a guy locked in the bathroom stuck on the toilet.
Press the main release discharge valve-- that should get him loose.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
!
Dre!
No!
Murderers!
You killed my dog, man.
Y'all gonna pay for this!
If I have to go on every talk show in America, y'all gonna pay!
Oprah, Ricki Lake, Dr, Phil bitch!
106th and Park.
Showtime At The Apollo.
I swear, they're gonna pay for this.
You don't treat people like this.
And that's what happened.
What exactly is your occupation, Nashawn?
- I'm an entrepreneur.
- I see.
So I guess it's fair to say you don't have a job.
No, I do--
Tell us about some of your businesses.
Any of 'em ever make any money?
- No.
- Exactly.
So it would be correct to say that you're nothin' more than a deadbeat lookin' for a quick dollar.
Right?
No further questions.
Wait!
That's not fair.
Order!
Your Honor, can I say something, please?
Be brief.
I watched my mom struggle to raise me on next to nothin', workin' for guys like you.
And I always knew that I had to make my own way, no matter what.
I might not have some fancy education or a Fortune 500 business, but I'm tryin'.
My mom always told me that you can't be successful until you try.
That's all I'm doin'.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Will the foreman please read the verdict?
Case number 077861.
Nashawn Wade vs. Worldwide Airlines, we find for the plaintiff and award him damages in the amount of $100 million.
Order!
Order!
Yo, cousin!
We did it, man!
We did it!
Yes!
What do you mean, "we"?
I didn't see your ass get stuck in no airplane toilet.
Whatever, I say we blow the first 20 mil on Rio, next 20 mil, Bangkok.
I hear they can do this thing--
Muggs, you're my cousin.
I'm not gonna forget about you, or the way you looked out for me when we was growin' up.
I'm not gonna let you convince me I'm fuckin' this money away.
You still on that strip club/daycare center thing?
Shit was genius.
Come on.
It was genius, Muggsy?
To who?
We lost all our damn money in a week.
We gonna do it straight this time, all right?
I wanna do something I can be proud of.
Whatever it is, I'm in.
There he is, Mr. Wade?
How does it feel to be the recipient of such a large reward by the court?
I mean, it feels good, ya know?
Justice has been served.
But I tell you what,
I'd trade all that money in to get back my dog Dre.
Nashawn, how's the ass?
The ass is fine, It is sittin' on $100 million,
Mr, Wade, can you tell us what you intend to do with all that money?
I'm gonna start my own airline.
No further questions.
Muggs, take care of that, please.
What is this-- BET's "How I'm Living"?
I'd like to give a shout-out to all five of my babies' mamas.
High five, Laquifa.
I'm comin', girl.
Yes, Lord!
Everybody. $100 million!
Relax.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
You the only sister.
You can't say nothin'?
What in the hell is taking her so long?
Relax, honey.
She has arthritis.
She's, like, 200 years old.
I know.
It's great.
Ready?
Go.
Mr. Hunkee?
- Yes.
- I've got good news and bad news.
The bad news is that your flight 114 to JFK has been canceled.
Oh, for the love of--
But the good news is we've been able to find another airline that can accommodate you this evening.
Would you be interested in another airline?
- Even Dad thinks you're cute.
- Get off me!
- You're such a whore.
- What did you say?
Did I stutter?
There you are.
Four tickets for flight 069 on NWA.
What you're going to want to do is go to Gate One-- that's Terminal X--and we'll send your luggage on down for you.
- Thank you for your help.
- You're quite welcome.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Don't get it greasy.
It's very expensive.
I know, I bought it.
Now, a gentleman always carries a lady's bags.
- So why are you carrying hers?
- Be kind, son.
If I play my cards right, she'll be your future mother figure.
That's scary.
Ooh, hey, sweetie.
Wait a minute.
Don't look back and not say anything.
Excuse me.
You got to move, lady.
Baby, come here.
Gimme a second.
Girl, you must not know who I am.
Nashawn Wade, baby.
I own NWA.
The boss.
Where the hell is Terminal X?
Relax, honey.
Didn't we just have a great vacation in Crackerland?
No, we didn't-- give me that stupid hat.
Leave it!
You know what would've been great?
Going to Hawaii alone.
Listen, you know the deal.
I only get to see my kids every other weekend.
Billy, where's your sister?
She's that way.
Great.
Heather, you can't just walk away from the family.
If you want to go somewhere, you gotta ask permission first.
Dad, I'm 18 years old.
Sorry.
She's 17.
You are 17.
Fine.
For a couple more hours.
I am 17, and then I'll be 18.
Then I can party and have sex.
- Sex?
!
No, no.
- Yeah, sex.
Missionary, doggie-style, rockin' the baby, gettin' tea-bagged, playin' the trombone while I'm tossin' his salad, hand jobs, ear jobs, blow jobs.
Gettin' a pearl necklace, ridin' the bologna pony...
- sucking--
- That's enough!
- Did she say bologna?
- I don't know.
...whenever I want, and best of all, I won't have to listen to you.
Can you believe that?
What came after getting tea-bagged?
Something about the trombone.
Okay, everybody, congratulations!
You guys have been punk'd!
There's cameras everywhere, right, son?
We'll be back in five minutes with the release forms.
Let's go.
Oh, shit!
Awesome!
- Terminal Malcolm X?
- Yeah.
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Usually you gotta go to two places,
- but there you get the one--
- This is a terminal?
It's great, 99 cents.
Everything.
Oh, check out the car.
This place has every-- there's a basketball court.
In your face!
Get your short ass on, you leprechaun.
Look like my ex-- short and stupid.
Everything's short.
I don't know about all that, but if Denzel walked his fine sexy ass in here right now,
I'm takin' the rest of the day off and gettin' straight down with the get down.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Girl, let me tell you, Denzel is nice, but I like the young thugs.
I love me some 50 Cent, baby.
Ooh, Shaniece.
Go, Shaniece!
It's your birthday.
We gonna party like it's your birthday.
Sip Bacardi like it's my birthday.
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not my birthday!
Look at this little nigga here.
Look more like five cent.
Nigga, can't you read?
The sign says put all metal objects in the container.
Take your ass off.
Get on back there!
Get your ass back there.
Cheap ass.
Shit goin' off 'cause that shit cheap.
That's why it's goin' off.
My flow, my show bought me the dough that bought me all my fancy things.
My cribs, my cars, my pools, my jewels.
Nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed.
Hold it!
You keep fuckin' up on my rhymes.
Move it along, nickel.
You wanna say somethin'?
!
I ain't slapped a bitch in two weeks.
Yeah, I got a whole lot of strength in the slap-a-bitch arm.
They had a whole bunch of dirty magazines--bathing suit issues.
Damn!
So you like that, huh?
You gonna love this.
Hold those for me, I won't be needing those on this flight.
Girl, what you got me--
The sweet smell of Alizé.
- Hunkee?
Elvis Hunkee?
- Yeah.
Karl Malone?
I used to play basketball with you in high school.
That's right.
We used to call you "The Paperboy."
Yeah, that was then.
I'm "The Mailman" now.
That's good.
My dad's a mailman, too.
Government jobs pay very well.
You don't understand, I play for the Lakers now.
Right, Karl.
I don't think you understand.
I used to play with you, man.
You can't shoot, remember?
That's why we never passed you the ball.
I thought it was because I was the only brother.
No, Karl.
It's 'cause you sucked!
Oh, I sucked?
What are you gonna do-- go all "postal" on me, Mr. Mailman?
My man, what's goin' on, baby?
Ah, that's nice.
That's real nice.
I'd like to be them jeans.
Make no sense.
Excuse me.
How you doin', man?
Can I get through here, sweetie?
What's goin' on, fellas?
My man.
When the buzzer pop, nigga, you stop!
Do y'all know who I am?
We don't give a damn about who you are.
Let your little ass take one more step we'll bury your ass in them fake-ass iguana shoes you're wearin'.
Ladies, it's me.
It's Nashawn Wade, owner of this airline.
Come on, remember.
I hired y'all.
- It's him.
- There ya go.
That's a little more like it.
Thought you had amnesia.
Yes, it is him!
You that little nigga got his ass caught in a toilet seat.
All right, little player, go on, take your little cute rich ass on through.
Go ahead, little player.
Bet that ass still tight, ain't it?
Shit, bitch.
I hope we don't lose our benefits over this.
We sorry, Mr. Wade!
My tooth is hurtin'.
And it's fuckin' with your breath, girl.
Upsettin' all my insides here.
Don't you say shit else for a year.
You done melted the whole side--
That's what you get for fuckin' us up.
I'll tell ya, I knew I shoulda got the new Aerostar.
Check out the safety rating.
I'm a little nervous.
I heard someone say this is the first flight for this airline.
It has five cup holders.
Honey, the FAA, they're very strict about who they let fly an airline.
It's gonna be okay, believe me.
Yeah, I know, but I think we're the only white people on the plane.
Girlfriend, like your bag.
Honey, no, we're not.
You ain't gonna pick me up?
!
Maybe it's a coincidence, you know, like a family reunion?
Million Man March?
Hey, what are you...
Hey, stop that!
Yeah, what up, son?
Yeah, yeah.
You know I'm like that.
I'm like that.
Damn.
What up?
Here's your card, Dad.
I think I melted the sucka.
Put everything on it but an Escalade.
I'm a holler at the shorty I saw at the basketball courts.
One love, dawg.
Where's my son?
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.
You doin' good?
You feel wonderful.
- Yeah.
All right.
- Hey. whoa!
That's my zipper!
And that's too loud for a zipper.
I don't know what you got in there, but we gonna find out.
- I got a plane to catch.
- Come with me.
Did you hear me, boy?
!
I bet you ain't never seen a chocolate super-deluxe woman like me before.
Have you?
No, I got a plane to catch.
I gotta go!
Where do you think you're goin', player?
I'm gonna get on--
We feds now, which means I can violate every last one of your civil rights.
Now drop them drawers...
Denzel.
Denzel?
Look, lady.
I just want--
Drop them drawers!
Show me that ass, nigga!
Now turn around.
Cavity check!
Girl, there was duct tape and peanut butter everywhere.
I told him, I don't care if you are a diplomat.
I don't bend into that position.
Girl, I ain't no circus freak.
This ain't Cirque du Soleil.
He's a fool.
Mi vida, you did the right thing.
Mi primo tried that once.
The doctors still can't find his left nut.
They say it's up there somewhere.
Give me his address.
I'll find it.
Hey, Muggsy!
Flame, not now.
Where's the pilots you hired, man?
- Come on, dawg--
- It's not come on now.
We're supposed to take off in 20 minutes.
Calm down, Little Bow-Wow.
He'll be here, all right?
- There he go right there.
- Who, him?
- Yeah, him.
- Right there?
- Right there.
- Him?
- Him right there?
- Yeah, him right there.
I told you to hire a black pilot, not no black baggage handler.
What is that?
I did what you asked me to, okay?
There ain't but two black pilots around, and one of 'em flyin' for Puffy.
How'd Puffy get that one?
- Don't worry.
- You're right, I'm just nervous.
I got his resumé right there.
My dawg, what's up, baby?
What's goin' on, Muggs?
How you been?
What's up, man?
- How are you, man?
- Ain't nothin' to it but do it.
Nashawn, Captain Mack.
Captain Mack, Nashawn.
My pleasure, brother.
Hey.
You're late, man.
Don't worry about me bein' late.
I'm gonna take this hooptie of yours up another 1,000 feet, catch me a slipstream, and we gonna be there five minutes early.
Real slick like hair grease, but with less mess.
- Can you dig it?
- Hell, yeah, I can dig it.
You really gonna do that?
No, I'm just fuckin' with ya.
Y'all two know each other?
He was fuckin' with me.
Muggs, I'm really not playin' right now.
I'm not, Muggs.
I was lookin' at your resumé, man.
I see that you flew in Desert Storm.
- That's pretty impressive.
- Actually, that's a typo.
I drew over in Desert Storm.
I'm sorry.
I didn't..
what you say?
I was the nigga that drew the little sayings on the bombs:
"Fuck Iraq." "Saddam, eat a dick." That was me.
Secret agent.
Matter of fact, I ain't even 'posed to be talkin' about that.
That's classified.
What the fuck?
!
Do you even know how to fly a plane, man?
I got my wings when I got out.
Got your wings when you got out?
You right.
Plus I ain't really got another choice right now.
Where's your uniform?
You lookin' at it.
The Mackin' is crackin'.
This is how I come.
I don't wear no square suits.
I'm a player.
We ride spinners.
Ride spinners and you write on bombs.
That's classified.
I'm gonna tell you what.
Get us there safe.
Can you do that?
You something' else, Muggs.
Drew on bombs.
- Excuse me, man,
- Yes, sir.
That's about a bitch.
- Where the cockpit at?
- You got that bong?
Whole bag of it, Preach.
- I gotta go.
- Do I pay you to talk on the phone?
Look at the captain.
He is too cute.
Hi, Captain.
- At ease, ladies.
- Hi, fly boy.
I just love the look of a man in uniform.
'Course, I like the look of a man out of uniform even better.
This is some cool shit fit for a real nigga.
Hey, what's poppin', my aeronautical hustlers?
Captain Mack, reporting to duty.
How you doin'.
Captain?
I'm Riggs. your flight engineer.
Have you ever met Gaeman?
I just seen one of them fruity motherfuckers in the hallway.
Nigga was eyeballing' me.
It's Gaeman, I am Leslie Gaeman, your copilot.
What's happenin'?
It's a very prestigious African name-- not like "gay man," two men fucking together, naked,
- in a bedroom.
Not me.
- Whatever, homey.
I like pussy like you.
- I can dig it.
- Yeah, you can dig it.
Everybody will be pregnant by the end of this flight.
Hello.
First class.
Right this way, big daddy.
Welcome to NWA.
Hi.
How's everybody?
Good.
Wow, this is great!
Oh, y'all are in low class.
- What?
- Low class, straight back.
This is nice, too.
Dad, this actually isn't that bad.
What kind of UPN operation is this?
It's not so bad.
All right, here we are.
Row 1 7 Chrysler.
Honey, you sit here.
Thank you.
- Do I have to sit...
- How you doin'?
You're gonna have to, okay?
Thank you.
Let's please put the divider down.
Do you have an "off" switch?
You need to lower the volume.
Man, you give a black man some money, this is how the airline's gonna look--plush, laid.
It's makin' me feel sexy already.
This is a sexy plane.
They got it chromed out with the white leather.
I think this is alligator butt.
Yeah, this is nice.
Little treat for you before the plane takes off, daddy, 'cause you treat me so right.
You nasty!
Can I help you, sir?
Everything's okay, I'm just trying to find my seat,
Boy, this a nice plane.
Nice cushion they got on these new planes.
This must be one of them 777's.
7574327.
Where my seat?
777.
The president should fly on this plane.
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, baby, how you doin'?
- I'm gonna show you to your seat.
- That's nice of you, cutie pie.
- Here we are.
- Let me shake your hand.
Come here.
Oh, boy!
That's nice.
Look at that.
Boy, I can just hear everything.
It's so beautiful in here.
Wait a minute.
Somebody got some nice perfume on.
Is that Victoria Don't Tell Nobody?
- No.
- Is that Boujeronee?
Not Boujeronee either.
I like the people that don't talk back.
Hard to get, I like that.
Cabin attendant?
Yes, sir?
Howdy do.
Where are you, baby?
There you are.
Get me a quadruple cognac and a cola back.
You know, I'm scared to fly.
I'm used to riding' buses.
My little nephew sent me on first class, because I'm a player.
You smell good, too.
I'm gonna have me some fun on this plane here.
Okey-dokey.
So you're gonna be in...
You're gonna go ahead to low class, okay.
- He tasted like chocolate.
- No way.
My God, what's going on?
Get the fuck out!
What is he doing?
Watch him.
Y'all better get his ass!
You ain't goin' nowhere without us, Osama.
If you gots to go to the bathroom, we goin' with you.
She holdin' and I'm shakin', player.
- That's right.
- It's cool, y'all.
We got this.
We security up in here.
Look straight.
- Hi.
- Hey.
This first class is incredible.
Girl, this plane is off the hook.
Have you seen the owner?
He's young, black, and from the pictures I've seen, he looks so good.
I'm sure he's great.
- And he's paid.
- Please direct your attention to the screen in front of you for a safety video.
What is this?
Now that you got on our plane and you be listenin'
You better just do as we say or you'll be missin'
Better put your seatbelt on or you'll be dyin'
If the plane goes crazy, then you will not be flyin'
Now we direct you to the nearest locations
Where you might desire to exit your vacations
If we lose the pressure, you'll be chokin'
Or if there's a fire, then you'll be smokin'
The oxygen we will be providin'
This some black shit here.
You're a survivor
- Here we go.
- There we go.
You're a survivor, you'll keep on flyin'
You're a survivor, you don't go down there
Honey, what is this?
You're a survivor, you not be dyin'
You're a survivor, you'll keep on flyin'
You're a survivor, you don't go down there
You're a survivor, you got your fair share
You're a survivor
Whoo, you're a survivor
There's the owner right there.
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to NWA Airlines.
Here at NWA, safety is a very important part of flying, but let's be real.
If something goes wrong, we're all going down, right?
Is that supposed to be funny?
I'm just kiddin'--I'm playin'.
That's why it's our policy that fun comes first.
So please, sit back, relax, and enjoy your flight.
You're a survivor.
You are.
Come on, now, stop it.
You got a brother feelin' like the president.
God bless America.
Giselle?
I gotta get outta here.
Giselle, wait.
Giselle, can you wait a minute, please?
What, Nashawn?
What do we possibly have to talk about?
Wow, I mean, you look great.
How you been?
I've been fine.
Just fine.
Is that all?
Actually, no, I mean.
I was doin' some thinkin'.
and I wanna talk to you.
Can I at least talk to you?
Giselle, where you gonna go?
The door is closed.
What's this?
Someone stepped up, Nashawn.
I'm engaged.
Hey, baby.
It's not a good time right now.
There's no easy way for me... for me to say this...
What?
This isn't workin' for me anymore.
What's not workin'?
- This is gettin' way too serious.
- What are you talkin' about?
I can't do this anymore.
- I can't.
- No.
You got change of a 50, man?
- Not right now, Muggs.
- Not now?
What's his problem, man?
Oh, boy.
Hey, hey, there, Blanca.
I was wondering if I could trouble you for a drink.
Ain't no drink down there.
Hell there ain't.
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I speak a little Español.
Really?
Testicles, one, two.
Hey, y'all, what's crackalackin'?
This is your soul plane chauffeur, Captain Antoine Mack speaking.
He sounds nice.
Welcome aboard NWA flight 069 from the 310 to the 212.
It's time to bust this corner, y'all.
In a hot second,
I'll be hittin' them switches and gettin' this bitch pumping' and jumpin'.
What?
!
So screw your shit on tight and enjoy the flight.
What did he say?
He was just saying that we'll be leaving in a couple of seconds, so put your seatbelt on, make sure they're tight.
Amateurs.
- Why didn't he say so?
- Exactly.
Yo, Gaeman, why don't you go secure the cockpit, homey?
Yes.
Right away.
This motherfucker is locked.
Fred G. Sanford, my nigga.
And the "G" is for goin' places.
Can you dig it?
Now we ready to roll.
Nigga got switches in this motherfucker.
Shit.
And they work.
What?
This motherfucker hot, cuz.
- Oh, my God!
- Bounce with me.
This motherfucker's fucked up.
- Like a elephant.
- Yeah.
Bounce, bounce.
I have the perfect music for this.
Yes, I have it right here.
Hey, man, hold on, man.
- Hold the fuck on.
- Like elephant.
No, man, you gotta turn that bullshit off.
We can't be ridin' to that bullshit, man.
Don't insult my music.
We ridin' to some gangsta shit.
Pop that in, man.
Captain don't wanna hear that Zimbabwe ah-wah-wah shit.
Get that shit out.
Get it the fuck outta here.
I'm the captain of this motherfuckin' ship.
Captain, what the hell is wrong with you?
Man, I'm afraid of heights.
Afraid of heights?
!
Hit her with a bat, hit her with a bat
Hit her with a whoo-whoo
- Easy, Kobe.
She's 17.
- Dad, I'm 18.
Honey, I'm gonna excuse myself
- and go to the restroom.
- Okay.
I think I'm gonna go check out the plane.
Is that all right?
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Stay for a while.
Oh, my sweet black Jesus!
Hey, good evenin'.
I didn't know anybody was in here.
- I'll come back later.
- Why?
I'm still gonna be here.
I tell you what.
You take care of your business, I take care of mine.
I just don't feel comfortable, I'll just hold it.
You don't want to do that.
That stuff back up on you, top of your head fly clean off.
Sit down, make yourself at home.
I'm sorry.
We don't get that many of y'all on the plane.
For those with no junk in their trunk.
That is a nice vest.
I ain't seen one of them since Lionel and the Jeffersons.
What ever happened to Lionel?
I thought he was--
Would you mind?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Little fella kinda shy?
Goddamn!
Sorry.
I guess you can't have lightnin' without the thunder.
Somebody still likes that pork, I see.
I think this was a false alarm.
I'm gonna go back to my seat.
The paint is peeling.
That must be a big one.
Yeah, it's big.
I've got just the thing.
I can't believe that this is you.
So you subscribe to "Black Proud"?
This is the first time I've picked it up.
Yeah, it was freezin' that day.
Really?
You could never tell that from the picture.
Why, thank you.
Usually, the problem is, I'm hangin' out the bottom of my boxers.
Oh, my goodness.
Hi.
I think you're in my seat.
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Jerome.
Hi.
Hello.
Jerome was telling me about how he hangs out the bottom of his boxers.
That's nice.
They're about to serve dinner, so you might want to go back to your chair.
Oh, yeah.
You're right.
Yeah.
It was nice meetin' you.
It was nice meeting you, too, Barbara.
Nice meeting you, too, Jerome.
Bye.
Hangin' out the bottom of his boxers--
My God, is that him?
!
- That thing has a face on it,
- No, but it's gonna.
Are you all right, sir?
Course, I'm all right, I'm a G, ain't I?
I will make the announcement.
No, you won't.
Give me this motherfucker.
I'm makin' the announcement.
I'm the captain.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our cruising altitude of 33,000 feet,
33,000 feet?
!
Oh, shit, man.
We fuckin' higher than Redman at the Source awards.
Shit don't make no motherfuckin' sense to be this high, cuz.
Man, I feel sick.
Oh, fuck.
Ain't this some shit?
What the hell's goin' on here?
This nigga's afraid of heights.
How you gonna be afraid of heights if you the captain?
I ain't never been off the ground before.
We've flown computer simulators.
You told me you got your wings when you got out the Air Force.
No, I didn't.
I told you I got my wings when I got out.
When I got out of Pelican Bay State Corrections Facility.
It was either get a GED or take a pilot class.
You learned how to fly in the prison?
Hey, man, don't get mad 'cause I spent your money to get a good education.
Shit, me and my homeboys passed the class with flying colors.
Let me see.
- I miss them niggas, man.
- Those are his niggas.
The Taliban.
I'm gonna tell you what.
Y'all better fix it.
Gay-man, Captain Mack--
It's Gaeman!
I don't give a damn.
Fix it.
I'm no bitch, you understand?
It's Gaeman.
You gonna be a gay man.
Fix it.
Put this shit on autopilot.
I'm goin' to the lavatory.
I got to boo-boo.
- What ya doin'?
- I'm countin' my tips.
- Tips from where?
- Back there,
...low class motherfucker.
Hey, nigga!
Oh, boss man.
Hey, man, you mind if I get in here?
Come on.
Hold on.
Got a new shooter.
- One shot, baby, you in?
- No.
Nigga, is ya in?
What?
- You said I could run business class, right?
- Yeah, I did.
So I'm runnin' this motherfucker like Vegas on fight night.
We got a cockfight we setting' up in ten minutes.
Cockfight?
!
I'm in.
No.
Let me tell you over here.
I don't even want everybody in my business.
Hold me down.
- What's up, cuz?
- You know what?
I'm not even gonna make a scene in here.
I'm goin' back to the front of the plane.
When I get back here, I want this to be business class.
- Okay.
You got it, man.
- You can do that for me?
My man.
Thank you, Muggs.
Would you like champagne or wine?
We'll have champagne.
Would you like Moet or Cristal?
Motit...et.
Moet.
All right.
I know you have a drinking problem, so please drink slow.
That's for you.
And sir, please don't swallow your ice.
That's all I can afford to give you.
Hello.
Would you like Colt .45
or Alizé?
Maybe you could explain to us what those are.
My pleasure, sir.
Colt .45 tastes like liquored-up beer, and it sneaks up on you all of a sudden.
And Alizé--oh, that's my favorite.
It's from France.
It's a cog-nac, it's very fruity, and it'll make you wanna do the hucklebuck, then pass out in your own juices.
Guess I'll have that.
Wise choice.
Yo, player, you got a little somethin'-somethin' for me?
Yeah, I have a shorty 40.
No, no.
Do you have any whole milk?
Sir, that is nasty.
I do have a Puerto Rican lady who's lactating', I'll see what I can do.
Tonight, we're serving a plate of gourmet soul food with your choice of lobster and filet mignon or crisp duck confit,
I'll have the filet,
And for you, sir?
I ordered a special Kosher meal... yag-weh.
Excuse me?
That's fried chicken in hot sauce.
Lobster, filet mignon or duck?
I'll take the fee-lan.
All right, I need you to take a breast or a leg and a wing and pass it back.
Exactly.
You guys, share your napkins with your neighbor.
One for every two people.
Sharing is caring.
Don't get greedy.
One piece.
Hi.
Would you like some dessert?
Boss man, low class is outta liquor, so I thought I would come in here and...
Someone is strolling' down memory lane.
No, I'm just, you know, checkin' on things, makin' sure they okay, that's all.
Yeah, right.
I know that look.
I had that same look of regret after I ran into Lee-- my little Asian butterfly.
We had a whirlwind romance that ended in heartbreak... and stomach pumping'.
When I saw him again, I tried to apologize, but I couldn't.
I just felt so bad leaving him in that hospital all bloated and distended.
Did you just grind on me?
A little.
What does that sick-ass story have to do with me?
I've never left nobody in the hospital filled with nothin'.
It means, Mr. Righteous, that if you have a chance to make things right again, you should take it.
Who knows what could've happened?
Lee had plenty ancient secret to show me.
Thank you.
Flame.
Okay?
You're welcome.
Now, how much Colt .45
to Sierra Mist do you mix to get bubbly?
Probably half and half.
You mind if I sit down?
It's your plane.
It really doesn't have to be like this.
How is it supposed to be?
So who's this guy?
Let's just let it go, okay?
I just came over here to talk to you.
You just disappeared.
I didn't even hear from you.
Giselle, you were 3,000 miles away.
I tried to get in touch with you.
Let's just let it go.
I don't know what smells better-- this meal or your delightful perfume.
Thank you.
You're too kind.
You know, a lot of smart women find blind men sexy.
- You know why?
- No.
But I'm sure you're about to tell me.
When you lose one sense, it makes your other senses stronger,
I have more of a sensitive touch than the average man,
Please!
Let me tell you about this love I had,
She was on the trampoline, landed right in my lap.
Bang!
She stayed there for 1 5 years.
People crazy about me.
People love me.
- You don't say.
- Don't say?
I do say it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
People love me.
See these fingers here?
These fingers got eyes on 'em just like 20/20 vision.
You know what I mean?
They... wait a minute.
Move that other leg out the way.
Move that dress up, girl.
Oh, boy, moist.
You just as tender as you can be.
You a little frisky thing.
You got a little puddle here.
Oh, you big, too.
You ain't no baby.
This is wonderful.
I love freaky stuff like this.
Just let yourself go.
I'm gonna let myself go, too.
I'm feelin' something, too.
This ain't like me.
I don't usually go this quick.
I'm goin' now.
Let me tell you.
Where my yack?
I'm a player... player!
- Hey, now.
- Oh, excuse me,
No, it's cool, I'm the attendant,
You can sit this one out, my brother.
I'm just gonna wash my hands.
Got me a wild woman sitting' next to me and look what I got.
Bang!
Stinky pinky.
Stinky pinky, here you go.
Hey, brother.
I ain't washin' that one, I'm washin' this one.
She using' cilantro.
I love that freaky shit.
The only way you got stinky pinky is if you was sittin' next to Miss Potato Head.
There's always some dude who's a player hater 'cause he ain't gettin' none.
Just 'cause you blind don't mean I won't whip your ass.
Lookin' like a disco lemon.
Son of a bitch!
All right, you suit-and-tie-wearin' motherfuckers.
A little green gets you in between.
The more dough, the more they show.
Now, a true player is a payer, am I right?
That's what's up.
We don't park collars at NWA--we park dollars.
You heard me?
If you can afford business class, you can afford some business ass.
Hey, Muggs, what's goin' on?
- Where?
- Here.
- Here.
What is this?
- It's all good up in here, baby.
We got Asian persuasion, butter pecan freakin', chocolate deluxe.
I got it all in my little shopping mall.
What is it you're not gettin'?
First gambling', now this?
It's illegal, man.
You with the FAA, nigga?
- No.
What are you talkin' about?
- Ain't no rules in the air.
Listen to me.
That's not the point, man.
It's a family airline.
You got ladies up in here?
I sure do!
Listen to me.
We not in the 'hood no more.
Hey, Nashawn.
Hey!
What's this about?
The girls just wanted to show their appreciation for everything you've done.
If you stick around for a minute.
I'm sure it'd make the ladies very, very happy.
Start with this.
Just like that?
You're so sexy.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Back up.
Oh, my God!
Hey, move, devil.
Get it together and get it fast.
You got to get off the pole.
Hey, baby, watch your step.
Hey.
I guess there are some things you can commit to.
You talkin' 'bout this?
I'm just doin' my job, that's all.
Yeah, it looks like you're a workaholic.
And here I was thinkin' I was too hard on you before.
Guess you're the man now.
Wait, Giselle.
What the fuck am I doin'?
!
You ready for this?
- Yeah.
- You ready?
Oh, yeah, daddy.
- You sure?
- Wait.
Don't fight the feelin', baby.
What the hell is you doin' in here?
That's the problem with you young cats.
You talk too much.
- A woman like that...
- You do talk a lot.
...wants a man of action.
I was wonderin' if you can help my friend Ben here.
He needs you to take him back to his seat.
Yeah, Ben, I believe I know where this cat is sittin'.
Dig this here.
You don't need a lot of space.
Superman changed in a phone booth.
Hey, don't be...
man, don't be touchin'...
Tidy Bowl man.
We gonna need this right here.
- Ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, what the hell is this?
I seen this on an episode of "Real Sex".
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.
All you gotta do is have a safety word.
You got one?
Yeah, when I say.
"Get off me, you crazy bitch", you stop choking' me.
Ow!
Shit!
Actually, I wish you'd stop smacking' me.
You like it.
- It's tight.
- It's supposed to be tight.
That's why you buy me the good shit.
The belt is too damn tight!
Stop your bitch-ass complainin' and give me what you promised.
I can't feel my toes!
I can't feel your dick, but I ain't complaining'.
D.J., please, don't stop.
Five more seconds.
Cheese, eggs, grits, chilies, yams, sunflower seeds.
No.
No!
No?
Man, this is not the way it happened on "Real Sex".
This is some real bullshit.
It was probably the turbulence and all the excituration of the moment, 'cause I used--
You see that, David.
Did you see that, David?
Why you always got to go--
I need to spank you with the bad...
I'm gonna punish him.
This motherfuckin' autopilot shit is cool as hell, man.
Just kick back and ride and glide.
Relax, motherfucker.
I should be captain of this plane.
Ten years with Chuku Airlines.
Chuku Airlines, where we treat you with a lot of respect.
This motherfucker.
Now I'm here with this nigga.
Nigga, shut the fuck up with that African mumbo-jumbo bullshit.
I hear you over there with that Chuku Airlines shit.
You with NWA Airlines, I'm the captain.
- I don't care.
- Real niggas drive real shit.
I should kill you.
We have a birthday girl, Captain.
This is Heather Hunkee.
She wanted to see our cockpit.
How old are you, Heather?
I just turned 18.
Is that right?
Oh, boy.
Attention, all players.
The upper deck will be open for your enjoyment.
We have a passenger who just turned 18 years old.
Her name is Heather Hunkee.
She is one cute little hottie with a whole lotta body.
Oh, yeah.
She'll be upstairs, so all players come up and keep her company.
No!
Hey, Virgie, how are you?
Good to see you.
Yeah, I know.
It's hot, right?
This is hot.
Let me take you to the bar.
Give me your jacket, girl.
Big Boy!
All my pimps, players, and hustlers-- y'all ready to set this motherfucker off, West Coast style?
As you see, we up in the clouds.
Got a gang of lovely ladies out there on the dance floor ready to go ahead and shake that ass and get they freak on.
To my fellas out there who ain't got no game-- yeah, I'm talkin' to you.
Don't even trip on it, 'cause we ain't goin' nowhere.
We locked in this bitch for four more hours till we touch down, so you might as well go ahead and get your swerve on.
- Marshall, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.
This is Heather.
She's turnin' 18 today.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Captain Mack is buyin' her her first drink.
What can I get for you?
Surprise me.
I got just what you need.
Girl, he is cute!
I know.
He's a looker.
He'll hook you up.
Cool!
All right, have a good time.
I gotta go back downstairs.
Keep an eye on her.
Oh, I will.
Not that kind of eye.
It's Big Boy.
What's goin' down, y'all?
We gonna keep this motherfucker crackin' until everybody in here pass the fuck out.
Yeah, this is my joint right here.
- Who'd you come here with?
- Don't worry about that.
- Please, Captain, I just--
- Hey, nigga!
What part of "you ain't flyin' this motherfuckin' plane"
don't you understand?
Sit back and enjoy the ride, Idi Amin.
What are you doing?
You fool!
Any motherfuckin' dry ass mushrooms of yours ain't gettin' me high no motherfuckin' way.
You need to fuck with the white boys.
They shit potent.
White boys, American shit.
This is African mushrooms, very dangerous.
They can kill you!
You ate 15 of them!
These are topical, for the skin.
I crush them up, and I put them for my itching.
Motherfucker, you got crabs?
!
This man got crabs.
You ain't sitting' in the pilot's seat for sure.
Ha ha, keep laughing.
It's not funny.
African crab is very aggressive.
They hunt us.
They can kill you.
That motherfucker is crazy as fuck, man.
They dangerous, and they kill you.
Fuck!
That Gaeman!
Excuse me.
Motherfucker, did you just touch me?
Yeah, I wanna get up in the club.
- You on the list?
- What list?
The goddamn guest list.
- Are you on it?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
What's your name?
Elvis Hunkee.
I wouldn't even have wrote no shit down like that, homey.
Maybe it's under The King, 'cause my friends, they call me "The King".
It's my nickname.
I ain't your friend, and you ain't no king, motherfucker.
Right.
Move!
I'm talkin' to you.
What's up?
Go right in.
All right, put 'em up.
It's go time.
It's definitely go time, motherfucker.
You about to get the best damn ass-whippin'.
I hope the little bitch you're lookin' for is worth dyin' for.
She is, 'cause that little bitch is my daughter.
Your daughter?
Why didn't you say that shit, man?
I got five daughters, man.
The little one, Trina, every time I see her.
she just runs into my arms, like, "Daddy.
Daddy!"
We have little tea parties and shit.
The little cups, and I put the little hat on.
Little table, man.
It was so beautiful.
My heart would, like, explode.
Yeah, I need to go upstairs.
- I miss my babies.
- I miss mine, too.
She's upstairs.
I never see them.
I'm always busy securing' shit.
- Honest living.

Secure your shit.
Secure your shit.
Go get your girl, man.
Go get your little girl.
Take care of your family, man!
Who's on the list?
Yo, Captain.
I got to go drain the monster.
What the hell's taking Gay-man so long?
I don't know, I ain't his mama.
Matter of fact, why don't you page him and tell him to bring his bitch ass up here 911.
Attention, Gay-man.
Attention, Gay-man, I have to go drain the monster.
Return to the cockpit immediately.
Man, I wouldn't answer that shit if I was you, homey.
Shake it up real fast then stop
Shake it up real fast then drop
Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a 18-wheeler
That... fine, but this... killer
Leakin', she soaking' wet
- Muggsy, what are you doin'?
- Cut!
Who the hell said cut?
Yeah.
Who the hell said cut?
The director says cut.
Damn!
Look, Nashawn.
I already know, dawg.
Come here.
Is that the Ying Yang Twins?
Yeah.
Watch out.
Ying Yang Twins!
What's up, baby?
Don't drink gasoline.
We got a bar.
I had a gold tooth.
I shoulda kept it for this.
Why y'all stop rollin'?
'Cause you came in.
No, don't stop on account of me, I'm the owner.
Nashawn Wade--that's me.
I'm the boss of this.
- Hey, roll camera!
- Who said roll camera?
I say roll camera.

Get on in there, girl.
Yo, Chris, I'm tellin' ya, man.

Yo, Muggsy, who is this kid?
Roll camera.

Lil' John back there.
Shake it like a salt shaker!
Can I get a glass of Hypno with some ice, please?
- Coming right up.
- What you doin' by yourself?
- Go have a good time.
- No, thanks.
- You okay?
- No.
So what's goin' on?
My son Billy--he doesn't want to be anything like me.
He says I got no flavor.
My daughter Heather-- she's growin' up so fast.
It seems like yesterday I was teachin' her to ride a bike.
Now she's out there...
Hey, what is tea-bagging?
That's the shit!
That's where you take your balls and dip 'em in a freak mouth.
you keep goin' up and down like...
- Then you dip, right.
- I got it.
Thank you.
I got a little carried away.
Gettin' back on the subject-- you raise your kids right, eventually they gonna wanna move on and find they own path.
You're probably right.
You're a lucky man, Nashawn.
I wouldn't say that.
It took me gettin' everything I ever wanted to realize I lost the best thing I ever had.
What was her name?
- Giselle.
- That's a beautiful name.
Bet she's beautiful.
Very.
Very!
Still love her?
Course I do.
Then go do somethin' about it.
Listen, when I met my Barbara.
I knew that moment I'd move heaven and earth to be with her.
I knew that she was worth it.
So you happy now?
Not really.
Last time I saw her, she was with this tall model type.
A real handsome black guy?
Yeah.
Sittin' in low class?
Yeah.
Got a dick like a fire hose?
Yeah.
Yeah, you lost her.
- Can he get another one?
- Double.
Have you talked to her?
She can't talk.
She must have vocal cord damage.
I can believe it.
Man, if my baby mama page me one more time, I swear to God...
What she want?
This motherfuckin' bitch wants some more child support money 'cause she heard I got this job.
I can't believe these hos nowadays.
She extorting' you?
That's messed up, man.
But you know what?
If I crash this motherfucker into a mountain right now, the bitch can't get shit from me.
Watch this.
Oh, shit!
Shit, my nigga!
Oh, shit!
Hold on, cuz!
- Oh, shit!
- Here we go.
That shit was funny as hell.
I know they trippin' off this shit in the back.
You fuckin' high, dawg.
You startin' to scare me now.
Here ya go.
I'm gonna bounce before Gay-dude and Riggs come back.
All right, my nigga.
I'm put this bitch on autopilot so I can enjoy myself.
Captain Mack need to kick back and enjoy this motherfuckin' situation.
Oh, shit.
Last mushroom.
Might as well go on and take this to the head.
Dry-ass mushroom, African motherfucker.
Here you are, sir.
Oh, hey, that's my dad.
I need to talk to him.
Hi, Daddy.
Happy birthday, Heather.
You mad at me?
No, Actually, I'm just glad to hear you call me daddy for a change,
It's been a while,
Usually it's shithead or asshole or something,
I'm sorry.
It's just I hate that you're with Boobra.
Barbara... and I are not together anymore.
I'm still upset that you and Mom aren't together.
I'm sorry about that, honey.
But your mom's with Dorothy now.
I'd like to be with your mom.
Hell, I'd love to be with your mom and Dorothy.
But that's not important.
What's important is that you know that I'm your dad, and whether you're 18 or 48 or 88, I'm gonna still protect you because I love you.
I love you, too, Daddy.
I'll always be your little girl.
Right.
I will.
What about all that stuff tonight?
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't do anything.
Really?
I was just saying stuff to get you mad.
I don't even know what half that stuff is.
What's tea-bagging anyway?
That's when you get down on top...
Dad!
Apparently, it's the shit.
Come here.
So can I have another blow job?
It's a drink.
It's cool.
Look, baby.
I'm sorry, and I wants to make it up to you.
Don't get it started because you know you're not gonna finish.
Why you bringin' up old shit?
Let me see them tits!
Okay, okay!
What's the plan?
Hold on one second.
I'm fixin' to be right back.
Good evening, Cap.
Is it cool if I come in?
This is tight up in here, dawg.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush, man.
I'll get straight to the point.
Me and my girl--we overly ambitious members of the mile-high club.
I was wondering if you would let us come in here, and, we could, like, do it.
All right, cool.
I'm fixin' to get her.
You probably gonna see her titties and everything, man.
I'll be right back, dawg.
Hey, this is my girl.
Hi, Captain.
I know you got stuff to do, so we just gonna do our thing, man.
Yeah, it's cool.
Okay, okay.
No, no.
Ain't that my game.
Ooh, yeah.
I like the way you doin' that.
Ooh, work it, daddy.
I'm tryin', but it's like a sauna down here,
It's like a fire,
- How's that?
- Oh, it's good, daddy.
You the king.
Tastes like chocolate puddin'.
Gots to have you right now.
- Got to have you right now, girl!
- Nasty fool!
Oh, shit.
That nigga dead!
He dead!
Get your ass off me!
He's dead!
This nigga's dead!
This nigga's dead!
The captain is dead!
Pork chop grease.
I'll take care of it.
The captain's dead!
That's our motto:
we fly, we party, we land.
That's what we tryin' to do, man.
Nashawn, we gotta talk.
I want to talk to you, too.
The captain is dead.
Dead?
Wait a minute.
Are we talkin' Tupac dead.
like maybe he is or maybe he isn't, or Wilt Chamberlain dead, like he ain't checkin' back in the game?
Dead like he can't fly this plane, dead.
People are freakin' out.
It's Muggsy hiring' these prison pilots.
You know what.
That's what we got a copilot for.
All we gotta do is find Gaeman, because I hired him.
He's a professional, and we should be cool.
Yes, counterclockwise.
Move your ass, baby.
Don't forget to squeeze my nipple like a cow.
Would you like to see my African walking stick?
Hey, hey, Gaeman.
Oh, my God.
Move over!
How are you, sir?
I was taking a bath, I was dirty.
You are clean now, ladies.
I got an emergency, I need you to fly the plane.
The plane?
Yeah.
- Me?
Fly the plane?
- Yes.
Oh, my God!
I get to fly.
They will have a parade!
Go, Gaeman!
Move out the way!
Move, you bitches!
I have to fly the plane.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, shit!
He fell hard.
Gaeman!
God damn!
What the hell am I supposed to do now?
You're gonna find some way to land this plane.
Meet me in the cockpit, okay?
- Meet you?
- In the cockpit.
I got one more left.
Here you go.
You gotta pull one of these damn cords.
I don't want this shit, man.
I'm responsible for these people.
I gotta try something.
Fuck them.
What are you, sick?
I know you, all right?
You can't even ride a bike.
How do you expect to land this thing?
It don't even--
It don't even matter.
I'm not runnin' out like I always do.
I'm gonna face this shit.
If you wanna go, go.
If you goin', go.
You gotta pull this one.
Hey, don't be grabbin' my cord.
You gonna make my chute ejaculate prematurely,
Baby, watch your head.
Don't let that touch you.
- I got a dead pilot, man.
- Just go.
God damn!
Oh, my God!
Not like this.
Listen, Giselle...
in case something happens, there's something I need to get off my chest.
That night when you and I broke up.
I was on your porch.
I overheard you and your father arguing about college.
What do you mean, you're not goin' away to college?
It's too far, I want to stay here where Nashawn is.
You gotta go, I been waitin' 18 years for this day to have the house to myself.
I'm not going.
You always dreamed of going to NYU.
Now they're offering you a full scholarship.
You tellin' me you're not goin' because of some little poop butt ass nigga who can't even keep a job!
Dad, I'm sorry, but I can't leave Nashawn.
I love him and he loves me.
You are going to college.
You're not messin' up my plans.
I didn't want you to throw all that away because of me.
I can get $200 a month for that room.
I just want you to know that I'm sorry, Giselle.
- Hey, baby.
- I'm so sorry for hurting you.
Leaving you was the biggest mistake of my life.
For what it's worth...
I never stopped loving you.
You better get in there.
You got a plane to land.
Yeah.
Cool.
I'm cool.
I got it.
I got it right now.
Mayday.
SOS.
I said SOS.
Come down, selecta.
- Nashawn!
- What?
Are you gonna cut a demo or radio in?
I don't know what to say.
I got something.
Hello?
This is Nashawn Wade, owner of NWA Airlines.
Yes, sir, the black one.
No, don't hang up.
Hello?
Can you please help us?
We got a situation here.
My pilot died, and I got people on the back of my plane asking for help and--hello?
They put me on hold.
Due to the high number of calls, your estimated wait time
- is 45 minutes.
- What are you doing here?
We family, man.
We was in this from the beginning, we gonna ride this out to the end.
That's my nigga, man.
Look at my watch.
What's up, G?
Excuse me.
I represent three of the four white people on board.
I want to tell you fellas we are behind you 100%.
What?
Hunkee, please.
I'm just here to find the little black box so I can wrap my big, black ass around it.
If I have to ride that tiny, indestructible motherfucker 30,000 feet to safety, trust you'll hear bitch screamin'.
"Hi ho, Silver".
Where's the box?
I really want to thank y'all for giving me all this confidence.
- I really feel it, I do.
- You're welcome.
Somebody knows how to land this plane, this would be the time to speak.
I saw a show on the Discovery channel, but that was about motorcycles.
Take control of the plane.
What?
You have to disengage the autopilot.
How do you know that?
I used to date this pilot, and we would make love in the cockpit.
You haven't had an orgasm until you've had it during descent.
Bitch, can you land this plane?
Show me where it is, Blanca.
What is it?
I don't remember.
That's what I told you...
I need you to go to the back then.
No, hold on.
Last time I was here...
Here, here!
There it is.
Push it.
Somebody help her.
Okay, I gotta grab it.
Guess I had a little control right away.
I'm flyin', y'all.
Okay, what's next, Blanca?
I would...
Yes, the flaps!
The flaps!
Adjusting the flaps.
What's next?
I think it was... the trim.
I cannot hear her.
I got it.
I see what you're sayin'.
What's next?
I don't know.
This is where he usually pops the cork.
We are so fucked!
Don't panic, please.
You're gonna be okay.
You can't use that phone while we're on the plane.
Girl, please, they say that to rip you off.
They want you to use their phone.
- I am calling for some help.
- No, I'm telling you.
Don't be hardheaded.
Don't use that phone.
Fuck that!
Okay.
All right.
We back on track right now.
What next, Blanca?
The wheels.
Muggsy, pull the wheels down.
Grab the wheel and do it slow.
I feel it comin' down, y'all,
Oh, yes!
Oh, D.J., this is it!
It's gonna happen this time, baby.
We about to die, you got me tied up down here.
Damn it, I don't give a fuck.
We goin' to heaven with one last nut.
Nigga, stay focused!
Yeah!
I'm doin' it!
I told you it was the turbulence.
You don't want none of this.
Here we go.
We gonna land.
New York, here we go!
This is it right here.
That's the ground!
We made it.
We gonna live.
I did it.
We down.
You did it!
That's just what you do, cousin.
Exactly what I do!
You see what I'm sayin'?
I was so scared.
You crazy bitch!
Fuck this airline!
You know what, she was on the way out anyway.
- Forget her, baby.
You did it.
- I did.
Yeah, I can do that.
All right, y'all with the mushy stuff.
I'm a go check on the passengers.
- Y'all just too cute.
- My boy.
Maybe we should go, too.
We should check on 'em, too.
All right.
Come on.
What a day.
Wait a minute.
Hold that, sugar dumpling'.
I don't know what smells better-- the New York air or your magnificent perfume.
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.
Wait a minute.
That's an Adam's apple.
I'm a player, but I don't play that way.
Floor walker!
No, I...
- Hey, Muggs.
- Yo, cousin.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
We made it!
What kind of shit-- this is Central Park.
Where is Central Park?
It's in New York, ain't it?
You got JFK, LaGuardia, Newark--
What you need an airport for, you got all this grass?
Ain't this a bitch?
This nigga is pissin' on the plane!
That's your problem.
You always thinkin' on the nega--
Hell, no, I know they didn't just steal my damn rims.
That's what your punk ass get.
You know how hard it is to get 84-inch rims?
That's a big-ass tire for a little-ass plane and a short-ass nigga.
Why don't you go put a doughnut in your mouth?
I am going to sue your ass, I am gonna sue the airline...
That's all you do is complain.
It doesn't matter, I'm not gonna let you spoil this for me.
I tell you what, Muggs, take everybody upstairs.
Drinks on me.
Let's party!
And we did party.
Just like I told y'all-- we fly, we party and we land.
Pop, where'd you get the moves from?
Where do ya think you got 'em from, son?
Wow!
This is the bomb!
What?
What did I say?
Let's dance!
I always love the airplanes, man.
Not just toys but the real ones too.
We live right next to the airport.
My mom would put my stroller outside
while she hung clothes on the line.
She always told that someday it will be me
Getting on one of those planes going someplace.
Well, I guess it didn't exactly work out that way.
Excuse me.

I might not had some fancy education or,
Fortune 500 business but,
But I am trying.
I mean my mum always told me that,
You can't be successful until you try.
That's all I am doing.
Thank you, Your Honour.

The End
INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA, 1979
I always loved airplanes, man.
Not just toys, but real ones, too.
We lived right next to the airport.
I remember my mom would put my stroller outside while she hung clothes on the line.
My mom always told me that someday, it would be me gettin' on one of those planes goin' someplace better.
But I guess it didn't exactly work out that way.
Final boarding announcement for Worldwide Airlines Flight 119.
I'm sorry, sir.
Your dog is too big to be on the plane.
You'll have to check him.
Wait.
No.
I usually just put him in my bag.
He's not that big.
Those are the rules.
You'll have to check your dog.
Or consider taking another airline.
Come on, man.
- Can I just please--
- Russ.
I can't just...
Come on, Dre.
- Come on.
- Don't worry, sir.
- We'll take good care of him.
- Please do.
That's my little boy right there.
See you when I get off.
- Excuse me.
Thank you.
- Enjoy your flight.
Our in-flight movie will be Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, starring Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd.
Nice.
That's the sound of my gat
This is heat.
This album is fire.
Chicken or beef stroganoff?
Chicken, I'll have the chicken.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- It smells good, though.
- Chicken or beef stroganoff?
I'm gonna have the chicken.
I like the way that smelled.
That was our last chicken.
I'm afraid I just have stroganoff.
So why would you ask me what I wanted?
What's in that?
Stroganoff.
That beef strogie.
That wasn't half bad.
It was good.
Almost got a little spit on you.
- Yes, you did.
- I'm sorry.
Are you all right, sir?
Where the bathroom?
- Straight down.
- Where?
Fire in the hole.
Excuse me.
So sorry.
Come on!
Hurry.
Get in there!
Damn!
Oh, shit!
So loose.
I got it.
That's it.
No, it's not.
This is the captain speaking.
We hit some turbulence.
We ask that you return to your seats.
We've turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.
I didn't know it was gonna be like that.
I can't get out!
My ass is stuck!
Come on.
God, please, I'm a Christian.
My ass is touching' the shit.
I don't wanna die like this!
Stewardess!
There's a guy locked in the bathroom stuck on the toilet.
Press the main release discharge valve-- that should get him loose.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
!
Dre!
No!
Murderers!
You killed my dog, man.
Y'all gonna pay for this!
If I have to go on every talk show in America, y'all gonna pay!
Oprah, Ricki Lake, Dr, Phil bitch!
106th and Park.
Showtime At The Apollo.
I swear, they're gonna pay for this.
You don't treat people like this.
And that's what happened.
What exactly is your occupation, Nashawn?
- I'm an entrepreneur.
- I see.
So I guess it's fair to say you don't have a job.
No, I do--
Tell us about some of your businesses.
Any of 'em ever make any money?
- No.
- Exactly.
So it would be correct to say that you're nothin' more than a deadbeat lookin' for a quick dollar.
Right?
No further questions.
Wait!
That's not fair.
Order!
Your Honor, can I say something, please?
Be brief.
I watched my mom struggle to raise me on next to nothin', workin' for guys like you.
And I always knew that I had to make my own way, no matter what.
I might not have some fancy education or a Fortune 500 business, but I'm tryin'.
My mom always told me that you can't be successful until you try.
That's all I'm doin'.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Will the foreman please read the verdict?
Case number 077861.
Nashawn Wade vs. Worldwide Airlines, we find for the plaintiff and award him damages in the amount of $100 million.
Order!
Order!
Yo, cousin!
We did it, man!
We did it!
Yes!
What do you mean, "we"?
I didn't see your ass get stuck in no airplane toilet.
Whatever, I say we blow the first 20 mil on Rio, next 20 mil, Bangkok.
I hear they can do this thing--
Muggs, you're my cousin.
I'm not gonna forget about you, or the way you looked out for me when we was growin' up.
I'm not gonna let you convince me I'm fuckin' this money away.
You still on that strip club/daycare center thing?
Shit was genius.
Come on.
It was genius, Muggsy?
To who?
We lost all our damn money in a week.
We gonna do it straight this time, all right?
I wanna do something I can be proud of.
Whatever it is, I'm in.
There he is, Mr. Wade?
How does it feel to be the recipient of such a large reward by the court?
I mean, it feels good, ya know?
Justice has been served.
But I tell you what,
I'd trade all that money in to get back my dog Dre.
Nashawn, how's the ass?
The ass is fine, It is sittin' on $100 million,
Mr, Wade, can you tell us what you intend to do with all that money?
I'm gonna start my own airline.
No further questions.
Muggs, take care of that, please.
What is this-- BET's "How I'm Living"?
I'd like to give a shout-out to all five of my babies' mamas.
High five, Laquifa.
I'm comin', girl.
Yes, Lord!
Everybody. $100 million!
Relax.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
You the only sister.
You can't say nothin'?
What in the hell is taking her so long?
Relax, honey.
She has arthritis.
She's, like, 200 years old.
I know.
It's great.
Ready?
Go.
Mr. Hunkee?
- Yes.
- I've got good news and bad news.
The bad news is that your flight 114 to JFK has been canceled.
Oh, for the love of--
But the good news is we've been able to find another airline that can accommodate you this evening.
Would you be interested in another airline?
- Even Dad thinks you're cute.
- Get off me!
- You're such a whore.
- What did you say?
Did I stutter?
There you are.
Four tickets for flight 069 on NWA.
What you're going to want to do is go to Gate One-- that's Terminal X--and we'll send your luggage on down for you.
- Thank you for your help.
- You're quite welcome.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Don't get it greasy.
It's very expensive.
I know, I bought it.
Now, a gentleman always carries a lady's bags.
- So why are you carrying hers?
- Be kind, son.
If I play my cards right, she'll be your future mother figure.
That's scary.
Ooh, hey, sweetie.
Wait a minute.
Don't look back and not say anything.
Excuse me.
You got to move, lady.
Baby, come here.
Gimme a second.
Girl, you must not know who I am.
Nashawn Wade, baby.
I own NWA.
The boss.
Where the hell is Terminal X?
Relax, honey.
Didn't we just have a great vacation in Crackerland?
No, we didn't-- give me that stupid hat.
Leave it!
You know what would've been great?
Going to Hawaii alone.
Listen, you know the deal.
I only get to see my kids every other weekend.
Billy, where's your sister?
She's that way.
Great.
Heather, you can't just walk away from the family.
If you want to go somewhere, you gotta ask permission first.
Dad, I'm 18 years old.
Sorry.
She's 17.
You are 17.
Fine.
For a couple more hours.
I am 17, and then I'll be 18.
Then I can party and have sex.
- Sex?
!
No, no.
- Yeah, sex.
Missionary, doggie-style, rockin' the baby, gettin' tea-bagged, playin' the trombone while I'm tossin' his salad, hand jobs, ear jobs, blow jobs.
Gettin' a pearl necklace, ridin' the bologna pony...
- sucking--
- That's enough!
- Did she say bologna?
- I don't know.
...whenever I want, and best of all, I won't have to listen to you.
Can you believe that?
What came after getting tea-bagged?
Something about the trombone.
Okay, everybody, congratulations!
You guys have been punk'd!
There's cameras everywhere, right, son?
We'll be back in five minutes with the release forms.
Let's go.
Oh, shit!
Awesome!
- Terminal Malcolm X?
- Yeah.
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Usually you gotta go to two places,

- This is a terminal?
It's great, 99 cents.
Everything.
Oh, check out the car.
This place has every-- there's a basketball court.
In your face!
Get your short ass on, you leprechaun.
Look like my ex-- short and stupid.
Everything's short.
I don't know about all that, but if Denzel walked his fine sexy ass in here right now,
I'm takin' the rest of the day off and gettin' straight down with the get down.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Girl, let me tell you, Denzel is nice, but I like the young thugs.
I love me some 50 Cent, baby.
Ooh, Shaniece.
Go, Shaniece!
It's your birthday.
We gonna party like it's your birthday.
Sip Bacardi like it's my birthday.
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not my birthday!
Look at this little nigga here.
Look more like five cent.
Nigga, can't you read?
The sign says put all metal objects in the container.
Take your ass off.
Get on back there!
Get your ass back there.
Cheap ass.
Shit goin' off 'cause that shit cheap.
That's why it's goin' off.
My flow, my show bought me the dough that bought me all my fancy things.
My cribs, my cars, my pools, my jewels.
Nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed.
Hold it!
You keep fuckin' up on my rhymes.
Move it along, nickel.
You wanna say somethin'?

I ain't slapped a bitch in two weeks.
Yeah, I got a whole lot of strength in the slap-a-bitch arm.
They had a whole bunch of dirty magazines--bathing suit issues.
Damn!
So you like that, huh?
You gonna love this.
Hold those for me, I won't be needing those on this flight.
Girl, what you got me--
The sweet smell of Alizé.

Elvis Hunkee?
- Yeah.
Karl Malone?
I used to play basketball with you in high school.
That's right.
We used to call you "The Paperboy."
Yeah, that was then.
I'm "The Mailman" now.
That's good.
My dad's a mailman, too.
Government jobs pay very well.
You don't understand, I play for the Lakers now.
Right, Karl.
I don't think you understand.
I used to play with you, man.
You can't shoot, remember?
That's why we never passed you the ball.
I thought it was because I was the only brother.
No, Karl.
It's 'cause you sucked!
Oh, I sucked?
What are you gonna do-- go all "postal" on me, Mr. Mailman?
My man, what's goin' on, baby?
Ah, that's nice.
That's real nice.
I'd like to be them jeans.
Make no sense.
Excuse me.

Can I get through here, sweetie?
What's goin' on, fellas?
My man.
When the buzzer pop, nigga, you stop!
Do y'all know who I am?
We don't give a damn about who you are.
Let your little ass take one more step we'll bury your ass in them fake-ass iguana shoes you're wearin'.
Ladies, it's me.
It's Nashawn Wade, owner of this airline.
Come on, remember.
I hired y'all.

That's a little more like it.

Yes, it is him!
You that little nigga got his ass caught in a toilet seat.
All right, little player, go on, take your little cute rich ass on through.
Go ahead, little player.

Shit, bitch.
I hope we don't lose our benefits over this.

Don't you say shit else for a year.

That's what you get for fuckin' us up.
I'll tell ya, I knew I shoulda got the new Aerostar.
Check out the safety rating.
I'm a little nervous.
I heard someone say this is the first flight for this airline.
It has five cup holders.
Honey, the FAA, they're very strict about who they let fly an airline.
It's gonna be okay, believe me.
Yeah, I know, but I think we're the only white people on the plane.
Girlfriend, like your bag.
Honey, no, we're not.
You ain't gonna pick me up?
!
Maybe it's a coincidence, you know, like a family reunion?
Million Man March?
Hey, what are you...
Hey, stop that!
Yeah, what up, son?
Yeah, yeah.
You know I'm like that.
I'm like that.
Damn.
What up?
Here's your card, Dad.
I think I melted the sucka.
Put everything on it but an Escalade.
I'm a holler at the shorty I saw at the basketball courts.
One love, dawg.
Where's my son?
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.
You doin' good?
You feel wonderful.
- Yeah.
All right.
- Hey. whoa!
That's my zipper!
And that's too loud for a zipper.
I don't know what you got in there, but we gonna find out.
- I got a plane to catch.
- Come with me.
Did you hear me, boy?
!
I bet you ain't never seen a chocolate super-deluxe woman like me before.
Have you?
No, I got a plane to catch.
I gotta go!
Where do you think you're goin', player?
I'm gonna get on--
We feds now, which means I can violate every last one of your civil rights.
Now drop them drawers...
Denzel.
Denzel?
Look, lady.
I just want--
Drop them drawers!
Show me that ass, nigga!
Now turn around.
Cavity check!
Girl, there was duct tape and peanut butter everywhere.
I told him, I don't care if you are a diplomat.
I don't bend into that position.
Girl, I ain't no circus freak.
This ain't Cirque du Soleil.
He's a fool.
Mi vida, you did the right thing.
Mi primo tried that once.
The doctors still can't find his left nut.
They say it's up there somewhere.
Give me his address.
I'll find it.
Hey, Muggsy!
Flame, not now.
Where's the pilots you hired, man?
- Come on, dawg--
- It's not come on now.
We're supposed to take off in 20 minutes.
Calm down, Little Bow-Wow.
He'll be here, all right?
- There he go right there.
- Who, him?
- Yeah, him.
- Right there?
- Right there.
- Him?
- Him right there?
- Yeah, him right there.
I told you to hire a black pilot, not no black baggage handler.
What is that?
I did what you asked me to, okay?
There ain't but two black pilots around, and one of 'em flyin' for Puffy.
How'd Puffy get that one?
- Don't worry.
- You're right, I'm just nervous.
I got his resumé right there.
My dawg, what's up, baby?
What's goin' on, Muggs?
How you been?
What's up, man?
- How are you, man?
- Ain't nothin' to it but do it.
Nashawn, Captain Mack.
Captain Mack, Nashawn.
My pleasure, brother.
Hey.
You're late, man.
Don't worry about me bein' late.
I'm gonna take this hooptie of yours up another 1,000 feet, catch me a slipstream, and we gonna be there five minutes early.
Real slick like hair grease, but with less mess.
- Can you dig it?
- Hell, yeah, I can dig it.
You really gonna do that?
No, I'm just fuckin' with ya.
Y'all two know each other?
He was fuckin' with me.
Muggs, I'm really not playin' right now.
I'm not, Muggs.
I was lookin' at your resumé, man.
I see that you flew in Desert Storm.
- That's pretty impressive.
- Actually, that's a typo.
I drew over in Desert Storm.
I'm sorry.
I didn't..
what you say?
I was the nigga that drew the little sayings on the bombs:
"Fuck Iraq." "Saddam, eat a dick." That was me.
Secret agent.
Matter of fact, I ain't even 'posed to be talkin' about that.
That's classified.
What the fuck?
!
Do you even know how to fly a plane, man?
I got my wings when I got out.
Got your wings when you got out?
You right.
Plus I ain't really got another choice right now.
Where's your uniform?
You lookin' at it.
The Mackin' is crackin'.
This is how I come.
I don't wear no square suits.
I'm a player.
We ride spinners.
Ride spinners and you write on bombs.
That's classified.
I'm gonna tell you what.
Get us there safe.
Can you do that?
You something' else, Muggs.
Drew on bombs.
- Excuse me, man,
- Yes, sir.
That's about a bitch.
- Where the cockpit at?
- You got that bong?
Whole bag of it, Preach.
- I gotta go.
- Do I pay you to talk on the phone?
Look at the captain.
He is too cute.
Hi, Captain.
- At ease, ladies.
- Hi, fly boy.
I just love the look of a man in uniform.
'Course, I like the look of a man out of uniform even better.
This is some cool shit fit for a real nigga.
Hey, what's poppin', my aeronautical hustlers?
Captain Mack, reporting to duty.
How you doin'.
Captain?
I'm Riggs. your flight engineer.
Have you ever met Gaeman?
I just seen one of them fruity motherfuckers in the hallway.
Nigga was eyeballing' me.
It's Gaeman, I am Leslie Gaeman, your copilot.
What's happenin'?
It's a very prestigious African name-- not like "gay man," two men fucking together, naked,
- in a bedroom.
Not me.
- Whatever, homey.
I like pussy like you.
- I can dig it.
- Yeah, you can dig it.
Everybody will be pregnant by the end of this flight.
Hello.
First class.
Right this way, big daddy.
Welcome to NWA.
Hi.
How's everybody?
Good.
Wow, this is great!
Oh, y'all are in low class.
- What?
- Low class, straight back.
This is nice, too.
Dad, this actually isn't that bad.
What kind of UPN operation is this?
It's not so bad.
All right, here we are.
Row 1 7 Chrysler.
Honey, you sit here.
Thank you.
- Do I have to sit...
- How you doin'?
You're gonna have to, okay?
Thank you.
Let's please put the divider down.
Do you have an "off" switch?
You need to lower the volume.
Man, you give a black man some money, this is how the airline's gonna look--plush, laid.
It's makin' me feel sexy already.
This is a sexy plane.
They got it chromed out with the white leather.
I think this is alligator butt.
Yeah, this is nice.
Little treat for you before the plane takes off, daddy, 'cause you treat me so right.
You nasty!
Can I help you, sir?
Everything's okay, I'm just trying to find my seat,
Boy, this a nice plane.
Nice cushion they got on these new planes.
This must be one of them 777's.
7574327.
Where my seat?
777.
The president should fly on this plane.
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, baby, how you doin'?
- I'm gonna show you to your seat.
- That's nice of you, cutie pie.
- Here we are.
- Let me shake your hand.
Come here.
Oh, boy!
That's nice.
Look at that.
Boy, I can just hear everything.
It's so beautiful in here.
Wait a minute.
Somebody got some nice perfume on.
Is that Victoria Don't Tell Nobody?
- No.
- Is that Boujeronee?
Not Boujeronee either.
I like the people that don't talk back.
Hard to get, I like that.
Cabin attendant?
Yes, sir?
Howdy do.
Where are you, baby?
There you are.
Get me a quadruple cognac and a cola back.
You know, I'm scared to fly.
I'm used to riding' buses.
My little nephew sent me on first class, because I'm a player.
You smell good, too.
I'm gonna have me some fun on this plane here.
Okey-dokey.
So you're gonna be in...
You're gonna go ahead to low class, okay.
- He tasted like chocolate.
- No way.
My God, what's going on?
Get the fuck out!
What is he doing?
Watch him.
Y'all better get his ass!
You ain't goin' nowhere without us, Osama.
If you gots to go to the bathroom, we goin' with you.
She holdin' and I'm shakin', player.
- That's right.
- It's cool, y'all.
We got this.
We security up in here.
Look straight.
- Hi.
- Hey.
This first class is incredible.
Girl, this plane is off the hook.
Have you seen the owner?
He's young, black, and from the pictures I've seen, he looks so good.
I'm sure he's great.
- And he's paid.
- Please direct your attention to the screen in front of you for a safety video.
What is this?
Now that you got on our plane and you be listenin'
You better just do as we say or you'll be missin'
Better put your seatbelt on or you'll be dyin'
If the plane goes crazy, then you will not be flyin'
Now we direct you to the nearest locations
Where you might desire to exit your vacations
If we lose the pressure, you'll be chokin'
Or if there's a fire, then you'll be smokin'
The oxygen we will be providin'
This some black shit here.
You're a survivor
- Here we go.
- There we go.
You're a survivor, you'll keep on flyin'
You're a survivor, you don't go down there
Honey, what is this?
You're a survivor, you not be dyin'
You're a survivor, you'll keep on flyin'
You're a survivor, you don't go down there
You're a survivor, you got your fair share
You're a survivor
Whoo, you're a survivor
There's the owner right there.
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to NWA Airlines.
Here at NWA, safety is a very important part of flying, but let's be real.
If something goes wrong, we're all going down, right?
Is that supposed to be funny?
I'm just kiddin'--I'm playin'.
That's why it's our policy that fun comes first.
So please, sit back, relax, and enjoy your flight.
You're a survivor.
You are.
Come on, now, stop it.
You got a brother feelin' like the president.
God bless America.
Giselle?
I gotta get outta here.
Giselle, wait.
Giselle, can you wait a minute, please?
What, Nashawn?
What do we possibly have to talk about?
Wow, I mean, you look great.
How you been?
I've been fine.
Just fine.
Is that all?
Actually, no, I mean.
I was doin' some thinkin'.
and I wanna talk to you.
Can I at least talk to you?
Giselle, where you gonna go?
The door is closed.
What's this?
Someone stepped up, Nashawn.
I'm engaged.
Hey, baby.
It's not a good time right now.
There's no easy way for me... for me to say this...
What?
This isn't workin' for me anymore.
What's not workin'?
- This is gettin' way too serious.
- What are you talkin' about?
I can't do this anymore.
- I can't.
- No.
You got change of a 50, man?
- Not right now, Muggs.
- Not now?
What's his problem, man?
Oh, boy.
Hey, hey, there, Blanca.
I was wondering if I could trouble you for a drink.
Ain't no drink down there.
Hell there ain't.
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I speak a little Español.
Really?
Testicles, one, two.
Hey, y'all, what's crackalackin'?
This is your soul plane chauffeur, Captain Antoine Mack speaking.
He sounds nice.
Welcome aboard NWA flight 069 from the 310 to the 212.
It's time to bust this corner, y'all.
In a hot second,
I'll be hittin' them switches and gettin' this bitch pumping' and jumpin'.
What?
!
So screw your shit on tight and enjoy the flight.
What did he say?
He was just saying that we'll be leaving in a couple of seconds, so put your seatbelt on, make sure they're tight.
Amateurs.
- Why didn't he say so?
- Exactly.
Yo, Gaeman, why don't you go secure the cockpit, homey?
Yes.
Right away.
This motherfucker is locked.
Fred G. Sanford, my nigga.
And the "G" is for goin' places.
Can you dig it?
Now we ready to roll.
Nigga got switches in this motherfucker.
Shit.
And they work.
What?
This motherfucker hot, cuz.
- Oh, my God!
- Bounce with me.
This motherfucker's fucked up.
- Like a elephant.
- Yeah.
Bounce, bounce.
I have the perfect music for this.
Yes, I have it right here.
Hey, man, hold on, man.
- Hold the fuck on.
- Like elephant.
No, man, you gotta turn that bullshit off.
We can't be ridin' to that bullshit, man.
Don't insult my music.
We ridin' to some gangsta shit.
Pop that in, man.
Captain don't wanna hear that Zimbabwe ah-wah-wah shit.
Get that shit out.
Get it the fuck outta here.
I'm the captain of this motherfuckin' ship.
Captain, what the hell is wrong with you?
Man, I'm afraid of heights.
Afraid of heights?
!
Hit her with a bat, hit her with a bat
Hit her with a whoo-whoo
- Easy, Kobe.
She's 17.
- Dad, I'm 18.
Honey, I'm gonna excuse myself
- and go to the restroom.
- Okay.
I think I'm gonna go check out the plane.
Is that all right?
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Stay for a while.
Oh, my sweet black Jesus!
Hey, good evenin'.
I didn't know anybody was in here.
- I'll come back later.
- Why?
I'm still gonna be here.
I tell you what.
You take care of your business, I take care of mine.
I just don't feel comfortable, I'll just hold it.
You don't want to do that.
That stuff back up on you, top of your head fly clean off.
Sit down, make yourself at home.
I'm sorry.
We don't get that many of y'all on the plane.
For those with no junk in their trunk.
That is a nice vest.
I ain't seen one of them since Lionel and the Jeffersons.
What ever happened to Lionel?
I thought he was--
Would you mind?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Little fella kinda shy?
Goddamn!
Sorry.
I guess you can't have lightnin' without the thunder.
Somebody still likes that pork, I see.
I think this was a false alarm.
I'm gonna go back to my seat.
The paint is peeling.
That must be a big one.
Yeah, it's big.
I've got just the thing.
I can't believe that this is you.
So you subscribe to "Black Proud"?
This is the first time I've picked it up.
Yeah, it was freezin' that day.
Really?
You could never tell that from the picture.
Why, thank you.
Usually, the problem is, I'm hangin' out the bottom of my boxers.
Oh, my goodness.
Hi.
I think you're in my seat.
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Jerome.
Hi.
Hello.
Jerome was telling me about how he hangs out the bottom of his boxers.
That's nice.
They're about to serve dinner, so you might want to go back to your chair.
Oh, yeah.
You're right.
Yeah.
It was nice meetin' you.
It was nice meeting you, too, Barbara.
Nice meeting you, too, Jerome.
Bye.
Hangin' out the bottom of his boxers--
My God, is that him?
!
- That thing has a face on it,
- No, but it's gonna.
Are you all right, sir?
Course, I'm all right, I'm a G, ain't I?
I will make the announcement.
No, you won't.
Give me this motherfucker.
I'm makin' the announcement.
I'm the captain.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our cruising altitude of 33,000 feet,
33,000 feet?
!
Oh, shit, man.
We fuckin' higher than Redman at the Source awards.
Shit don't make no motherfuckin' sense to be this high, cuz.
Man, I feel sick.
Oh, fuck.
Ain't this some shit?
What the hell's goin' on here?
This nigga's afraid of heights.
How you gonna be afraid of heights if you the captain?
I ain't never been off the ground before.
We've flown computer simulators.
You told me you got your wings when you got out the Air Force.
No, I didn't.
I told you I got my wings when I got out.
When I got out of Pelican Bay State Corrections Facility.
It was either get a GED or take a pilot class.
You learned how to fly in the prison?
Hey, man, don't get mad 'cause I spent your money to get a good education.
Shit, me and my homeboys passed the class with flying colors.
Let me see.
- I miss them niggas, man.
- Those are his niggas.
The Taliban.
I'm gonna tell you what.
Y'all better fix it.
Gay-man, Captain Mack--
It's Gaeman!
I don't give a damn.
Fix it.
I'm no bitch, you understand?
It's Gaeman.
You gonna be a gay man.
Fix it.
Put this shit on autopilot.
I'm goin' to the lavatory.
I got to boo-boo.
- What ya doin'?
- I'm countin' my tips.
- Tips from where?
- Back there,
...low class motherfucker.
Hey, nigga!
Oh, boss man.
Hey, man, you mind if I get in here?
Come on.
Hold on.
Got a new shooter.
- One shot, baby, you in?
- No.
Nigga, is ya in?
What?
- You said I could run business class, right?
- Yeah, I did.
So I'm runnin' this motherfucker like Vegas on fight night.
We got a cockfight we setting' up in ten minutes.
Cockfight?
!
I'm in.
No.
Let me tell you over here.
I don't even want everybody in my business.
Hold me down.
- What's up, cuz?
- You know what?
I'm not even gonna make a scene in here.
I'm goin' back to the front of the plane.
When I get back here, I want this to be business class.
- Okay.
You got it, man.
- You can do that for me?
My man.
Thank you, Muggs.
Would you like champagne or wine?
We'll have champagne.
Would you like Moet or Cristal?
Motit...et.
Moet.
All right.
I know you have a drinking problem, so please drink slow.
That's for you.
And sir, please don't swallow your ice.
That's all I can afford to give you.
Hello.
Would you like Colt .45
or Alizé?
Maybe you could explain to us what those are.
My pleasure, sir.
Colt .45 tastes like liquored-up beer, and it sneaks up on you all of a sudden.
And Alizé--oh, that's my favorite.
It's from France.
It's a cog-nac, it's very fruity, and it'll make you wanna do the hucklebuck, then pass out in your own juices.
Guess I'll have that.
Wise choice.
Yo, player, you got a little somethin'-somethin' for me?
Yeah, I have a shorty 40.
No, no.
Do you have any whole milk?
Sir, that is nasty.
I do have a Puerto Rican lady who's lactating', I'll see what I can do.
Tonight, we're serving a plate of gourmet soul food with your choice of lobster and filet mignon or crisp duck confit,
I'll have the filet,
And for you, sir?
I ordered a special Kosher meal... yag-weh.
Excuse me?
That's fried chicken in hot sauce.
Lobster, filet mignon or duck?
I'll take the fee-lan.
All right, I need you to take a breast or a leg and a wing and pass it back.
Exactly.
You guys, share your napkins with your neighbor.
One for every two people.
Sharing is caring.
Don't get greedy.
One piece.
Hi.
Would you like some dessert?
Boss man, low class is outta liquor, so I thought I would come in here and...
Someone is strolling' down memory lane.
No, I'm just, you know, checkin' on things, makin' sure they okay, that's all.
Yeah, right.
I know that look.
I had that same look of regret after I ran into Lee-- my little Asian butterfly.
We had a whirlwind romance that ended in heartbreak... and stomach pumping'.
When I saw him again, I tried to apologize, but I couldn't.
I just felt so bad leaving him in that hospital all bloated and distended.
Did you just grind on me?
A little.
What does that sick-ass story have to do with me?
I've never left nobody in the hospital filled with nothin'.
It means, Mr. Righteous, that if you have a chance to make things right again, you should take it.
Who knows what could've happened?
Lee had plenty ancient secret to show me.
Thank you.
Flame.
Okay?
You're welcome.
Now, how much Colt .45
to Sierra Mist do you mix to get bubbly?
Probably half and half.
You mind if I sit down?
It's your plane.
It really doesn't have to be like this.
How is it supposed to be?
So who's this guy?
Let's just let it go, okay?
I just came over here to talk to you.
You just disappeared.
I didn't even hear from you.
Giselle, you were 3,000 miles away.
I tried to get in touch with you.
Let's just let it go.
I don't know what smells better-- this meal or your delightful perfume.
Thank you.
You're too kind.
You know, a lot of smart women find blind men sexy.
- You know why?
- No.
But I'm sure you're about to tell me.
When you lose one sense, it makes your other senses stronger,
I have more of a sensitive touch than the average man,
Please!
Let me tell you about this love I had,
She was on the trampoline, landed right in my lap.
Bang!
She stayed there for 1 5 years.
People crazy about me.
People love me.
- You don't say.
- Don't say?
I do say it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
People love me.
See these fingers here?
These fingers got eyes on 'em just like 20/20 vision.
You know what I mean?
They... wait a minute.
Move that other leg out the way.
Move that dress up, girl.
Oh, boy, moist.
You just as tender as you can be.
You a little frisky thing.
You got a little puddle here.
Oh, you big, too.
You ain't no baby.
This is wonderful.
I love freaky stuff like this.
Just let yourself go.
I'm gonna let myself go, too.
I'm feelin' something, too.
This ain't like me.
I don't usually go this quick.
I'm goin' now.
Let me tell you.
Where my yack?
I'm a player... player!
- Hey, now.
- Oh, excuse me,
No, it's cool, I'm the attendant,
You can sit this one out, my brother.
I'm just gonna wash my hands.
Got me a wild woman sitting' next to me and look what I got.
Bang!
Stinky pinky.
Stinky pinky, here you go.
Hey, brother.
I ain't washin' that one, I'm washin' this one.
She using' cilantro.
I love that freaky shit.
The only way you got stinky pinky is if you was sittin' next to Miss Potato Head.
There's always some dude who's a player hater 'cause he ain't gettin' none.
Just 'cause you blind don't mean I won't whip your ass.
Lookin' like a disco lemon.
Son of a bitch!
All right, you suit-and-tie-wearin' motherfuckers.
A little green gets you in between.
The more dough, the more they show.
Now, a true player is a payer, am I right?
That's what's up.
We don't park collars at NWA--we park dollars.
You heard me?
If you can afford business class, you can afford some business ass.
Hey, Muggs, what's goin' on?
- Where?
- Here.
- Here.
What is this?
- It's all good up in here, baby.
We got Asian persuasion, butter pecan freakin', chocolate deluxe.
I got it all in my little shopping mall.
What is it you're not gettin'?
First gambling', now this?
It's illegal, man.
You with the FAA, nigga?
- No.
What are you talkin' about?
- Ain't no rules in the air.
Listen to me.
That's not the point, man.
It's a family airline.
You got ladies up in here?
I sure do!
Listen to me.
We not in the 'hood no more.
Hey, Nashawn.
Hey!
What's this about?
The girls just wanted to show their appreciation for everything you've done.
If you stick around for a minute.
I'm sure it'd make the ladies very, very happy.
Start with this.
Just like that?
You're so sexy.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Back up.
Oh, my God!
Hey, move, devil.
Get it together and get it fast.
You got to get off the pole.
Hey, baby, watch your step.
Hey.
I guess there are some things you can commit to.
You talkin' 'bout this?
I'm just doin' my job, that's all.
Yeah, it looks like you're a workaholic.
And here I was thinkin' I was too hard on you before.
Guess you're the man now.
Wait, Giselle.
What the fuck am I doin'?
!
You ready for this?
- Yeah.
- You ready?
Oh, yeah, daddy.
- You sure?
- Wait.
Don't fight the feelin', baby.
What the hell is you doin' in here?
That's the problem with you young cats.
You talk too much.
- A woman like that...
- You do talk a lot.
...wants a man of action.
I was wonderin' if you can help my friend Ben here.
He needs you to take him back to his seat.
Yeah, Ben, I believe I know where this cat is sittin'.
Dig this here.
You don't need a lot of space.
Superman changed in a phone booth.
Hey, don't be...
man, don't be touchin'...
Tidy Bowl man.
We gonna need this right here.
- Ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, what the hell is this?
I seen this on an episode of "Real Sex".
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.
All you gotta do is have a safety word.
You got one?
Yeah, when I say.
"Get off me, you crazy bitch", you stop choking' me.
Ow!
Shit!
Actually, I wish you'd stop smacking' me.
You like it.
- It's tight.
- It's supposed to be tight.
That's why you buy me the good shit.
The belt is too damn tight!
Stop your bitch-ass complainin' and give me what you promised.
I can't feel my toes!
I can't feel your dick, but I ain't complaining'.
D.J., please, don't stop.
Five more seconds.
Cheese, eggs, grits, chilies, yams, sunflower seeds.
No.
No!
No?
Man, this is not the way it happened on "Real Sex".
This is some real bullshit.
It was probably the turbulence and all the excituration of the moment, 'cause I used--
You see that, David.
Did you see that, David?
Why you always got to go--
I need to spank you with the bad...
I'm gonna punish him.
This motherfuckin' autopilot shit is cool as hell, man.
Just kick back and ride and glide.
Relax, motherfucker.
I should be captain of this plane.
Ten years with Chuku Airlines.
Chuku Airlines, where we treat you with a lot of respect.
This motherfucker.
Now I'm here with this nigga.
Nigga, shut the fuck up with that African mumbo-jumbo bullshit.
I hear you over there with that Chuku Airlines shit.
You with NWA Airlines, I'm the captain.
- I don't care.
- Real niggas drive real shit.
I should kill you.
We have a birthday girl, Captain.
This is Heather Hunkee.
She wanted to see our cockpit.
How old are you, Heather?
I just turned 18.
Is that right?
Oh, boy.
Attention, all players.
The upper deck will be open for your enjoyment.
We have a passenger who just turned 18 years old.
Her name is Heather Hunkee.
She is one cute little hottie with a whole lotta body.
Oh, yeah.
She'll be upstairs, so all players come up and keep her company.
No!
Hey, Virgie, how are you?
Good to see you.
Yeah, I know.
It's hot, right?
This is hot.
Let me take you to the bar.
Give me your jacket, girl.
Big Boy!
All my pimps, players, and hustlers-- y'all ready to set this motherfucker off, West Coast style?
As you see, we up in the clouds.
Got a gang of lovely ladies out there on the dance floor ready to go ahead and shake that ass and get they freak on.
To my fellas out there who ain't got no game-- yeah, I'm talkin' to you.
Don't even trip on it, 'cause we ain't goin' nowhere.
We locked in this bitch for four more hours till we touch down, so you might as well go ahead and get your swerve on.
- Marshall, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.
This is Heather.
She's turnin' 18 today.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Captain Mack is buyin' her her first drink.
What can I get for you?
Surprise me.
I got just what you need.
Girl, he is cute!
I know.
He's a looker.
He'll hook you up.
Cool!
All right, have a good time.
I gotta go back downstairs.
Keep an eye on her.
Oh, I will.
Not that kind of eye.
It's Big Boy.
What's goin' down, y'all?
We gonna keep this motherfucker crackin' until everybody in here pass the fuck out.
Yeah, this is my joint right here.
- Who'd you come here with?
- Don't worry about that.
- Please, Captain, I just--
- Hey, nigga!
What part of "you ain't flyin' this motherfuckin' plane"
don't you understand?
Sit back and enjoy the ride, Idi Amin.
What are you doing?
You fool!
Any motherfuckin' dry ass mushrooms of yours ain't gettin' me high no motherfuckin' way.
You need to fuck with the white boys.
They shit potent.
White boys, American shit.
This is African mushrooms, very dangerous.
They can kill you!
You ate 15 of them!
These are topical, for the skin.
I crush them up, and I put them for my itching.
Motherfucker, you got crabs?
!
This man got crabs.
You ain't sitting' in the pilot's seat for sure.
Ha ha, keep laughing.
It's not funny.
African crab is very aggressive.
They hunt us.
They can kill you.
That motherfucker is crazy as fuck, man.
They dangerous, and they kill you.
Fuck!
That Gaeman!
Excuse me.
Motherfucker, did you just touch me?
Yeah, I wanna get up in the club.
- You on the list?
- What list?
The goddamn guest list.
- Are you on it?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
What's your name?
Elvis Hunkee.
I wouldn't even have wrote no shit down like that, homey.
Maybe it's under The King, 'cause my friends, they call me "The King".
It's my nickname.
I ain't your friend, and you ain't no king, motherfucker.
Right.
Move!
I'm talkin' to you.
What's up?
Go right in.
All right, put 'em up.
It's go time.
It's definitely go time, motherfucker.
You about to get the best damn ass-whippin'.
I hope the little bitch you're lookin' for is worth dyin' for.
She is, 'cause that little bitch is my daughter.
Your daughter?
Why didn't you say that shit, man?
I got five daughters, man.
The little one, Trina, every time I see her.
she just runs into my arms, like, "Daddy.
Daddy!"
We have little tea parties and shit.
The little cups, and I put the little hat on.
Little table, man.
It was so beautiful.
My heart would, like, explode.
Yeah, I need to go upstairs.
- I miss my babies.
- I miss mine, too.
She's upstairs.
I never see them.
I'm always busy securing' shit.
- Honest living.
- I never see 'em, dawg.
Secure your shit.
Secure your shit.
Go get your girl, man.
Go get your little girl.
Take care of your family, man!
Who's on the list?
Yo, Captain.
I got to go drain the monster.
What the hell's taking Gay-man so long?
I don't know, I ain't his mama.
Matter of fact, why don't you page him and tell him to bring his bitch ass up here 911.
Attention, Gay-man.
Attention, Gay-man, I have to go drain the monster.
Return to the cockpit immediately.
Man, I wouldn't answer that shit if I was you, homey.
Shake it up real fast then stop
Shake it up real fast then drop
Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like a 18-wheeler
That... fine, but this... killer
Leakin', she soaking' wet
- Muggsy, what are you doin'?
- Cut!
Who the hell said cut?
Yeah.
Who the hell said cut?
The director says cut.
Damn!
Look, Nashawn.
I already know, dawg.
Come here.
Is that the Ying Yang Twins?
Yeah.
Watch out.
Ying Yang Twins!
What's up, baby?
Don't drink gasoline.
We got a bar.
I had a gold tooth.
I shoulda kept it for this.
Why y'all stop rollin'?
'Cause you came in.
No, don't stop on account of me, I'm the owner.
Nashawn Wade--that's me.
I'm the boss of this.
- Hey, roll camera!
- Who said roll camera?
I say roll camera.
- That's my job.
- That's his job.
Chris, I'm tellin' ya, we need more sexy in this video.
Let's go, Tamika.
Get in there.
This cool?
- Yes, sir.
- Tamika, let's get in there.
Get on in there, girl.
Yo, Chris, I'm tellin' ya, man.
We need more ass in this video, and it'd be off the hook.
Yo, Muggsy, who is this kid?
Roll camera.
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.
Lil' John back there.
Shake it like a salt shaker!
Can I get a glass of Hypno with some ice, please?
- Coming right up.
- What you doin' by yourself?
- Go have a good time.
- No, thanks.
- You okay?
- No.
So what's goin' on?
My son Billy--he doesn't want to be anything like me.
He says I got no flavor.
My daughter Heather-- she's growin' up so fast.
It seems like yesterday I was teachin' her to ride a bike.
Now she's out there...
Hey, what is tea-bagging?
That's the shit!
That's where you take your balls and dip 'em in a freak mouth.
you keep goin' up and down like...
- Then you dip, right.
- I got it.
Thank you.
I got a little carried away.
Gettin' back on the subject-- you raise your kids right, eventually they gonna wanna move on and find they own path.
You're probably right.
You're a lucky man, Nashawn.
I wouldn't say that.
It took me gettin' everything I ever wanted to realize I lost the best thing I ever had.
What was her name?
- Giselle.
- That's a beautiful name.
Bet she's beautiful.
Very.
Very!
Still love her?
Course I do.
Then go do somethin' about it.
Listen, when I met my Barbara.
I knew that moment I'd move heaven and earth to be with her.
I knew that she was worth it.
So you happy now?
Not really.
Last time I saw her, she was with this tall model type.
A real handsome black guy?
Yeah.
Sittin' in low class?
Yeah.
Got a dick like a fire hose?
Yeah.
Yeah, you lost her.
- Can he get another one?
- Double.
Have you talked to her?
She can't talk.
She must have vocal cord damage.
I can believe it.
Man, if my baby mama page me one more time, I swear to God...
What she want?
This motherfuckin' bitch wants some more child support money 'cause she heard I got this job.
I can't believe these hos nowadays.
She extorting' you?
That's messed up, man.
But you know what?
If I crash this motherfucker into a mountain right now, the bitch can't get shit from me.
Watch this.
Oh, shit!
Shit, my nigga!
Oh, shit!
Hold on, cuz!
- Oh, shit!
- Here we go.
That shit was funny as hell.
I know they trippin' off this shit in the back.
You fuckin' high, dawg.
You startin' to scare me now.
Here ya go.
I'm gonna bounce before Gay-dude and Riggs come back.
All right, my nigga.
I'm put this bitch on autopilot so I can enjoy myself.
Captain Mack need to kick back and enjoy this motherfuckin' situation.
Oh, shit.
Last mushroom.
Might as well go on and take this to the head.
Dry-ass mushroom, African motherfucker.
Here you are, sir.
Oh, hey, that's my dad.
I need to talk to him.
Hi, Daddy.
Happy birthday, Heather.
You mad at me?
No, Actually, I'm just glad to hear you call me daddy for a change,
It's been a while,
Usually it's shithead or asshole or something,
I'm sorry.
It's just I hate that you're with Boobra.
Barbara... and I are not together anymore.
I'm still upset that you and Mom aren't together.
I'm sorry about that, honey.
But your mom's with Dorothy now.
I'd like to be with your mom.
Hell, I'd love to be with your mom and Dorothy.
But that's not important.
What's important is that you know that I'm your dad, and whether you're 18 or 48 or 88, I'm gonna still protect you because I love you.
I love you, too, Daddy.
I'll always be your little girl.
Right.
I will.
What about all that stuff tonight?
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't do anything.
Really?
I was just saying stuff to get you mad.
I don't even know what half that stuff is.
What's tea-bagging anyway?
That's when you get down on top...
Dad!
Apparently, it's the shit.
Come here.
So can I have another blow job?
It's a drink.
It's cool.
Look, baby.
I'm sorry, and I wants to make it up to you.
Don't get it started because you know you're not gonna finish.
Why you bringin' up old shit?
Let me see them tits!
Okay, okay!
What's the plan?
Hold on one second.
I'm fixin' to be right back.
Good evening, Cap.
Is it cool if I come in?
This is tight up in here, dawg.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush, man.
I'll get straight to the point.
Me and my girl--we overly ambitious members of the mile-high club.
I was wondering if you would let us come in here, and, we could, like, do it.
All right, cool.
I'm fixin' to get her.
You probably gonna see her titties and everything, man.
I'll be right back, dawg.
Hey, this is my girl.
Hi, Captain.
I know you got stuff to do, so we just gonna do our thing, man.
Yeah, it's cool.
Okay, okay.
No, no.
Ain't that my game.
Ooh, yeah.
I like the way you doin' that.
Ooh, work it, daddy.
I'm tryin', but it's like a sauna down here,
It's like a fire,
- How's that?
- Oh, it's good, daddy.
You the king.
Tastes like chocolate puddin'.
Gots to have you right now.
- Got to have you right now, girl!
- Nasty fool!
Oh, shit.
That nigga dead!
He dead!
Get your ass off me!
He's dead!
This nigga's dead!
This nigga's dead!
The captain is dead!
Pork chop grease.
I'll take care of it.
The captain's dead!
That's our motto:
we fly, we party, we land.
That's what we tryin' to do, man.
Nashawn, we gotta talk.
I want to talk to you, too.
The captain is dead.
Dead?
Wait a minute.
Are we talkin' Tupac dead.
like maybe he is or maybe he isn't, or Wilt Chamberlain dead, like he ain't checkin' back in the game?
Dead like he can't fly this plane, dead.
People are freakin' out.
It's Muggsy hiring' these prison pilots.
You know what.
That's what we got a copilot for.
All we gotta do is find Gaeman, because I hired him.
He's a professional, and we should be cool.
Yes, counterclockwise.
Move your ass, baby.
Don't forget to squeeze my nipple like a cow.
Would you like to see my African walking stick?
Hey, hey, Gaeman.
Oh, my God.
Move over!
How are you, sir?
I was taking a bath, I was dirty.
You are clean now, ladies.
I got an emergency, I need you to fly the plane.
The plane?
Yeah.
- Me?
Fly the plane?
- Yes.
Oh, my God!
I get to fly.
They will have a parade!
Go, Gaeman!
Move out the way!
Move, you bitches!
I have to fly the plane.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, shit!
He fell hard.
Gaeman!
God damn!
What the hell am I supposed to do now?
You're gonna find some way to land this plane.
Meet me in the cockpit, okay?
- Meet you?
- In the cockpit.
I got one more left.
Here you go.
You gotta pull one of these damn cords.
I don't want this shit, man.
I'm responsible for these people.
I gotta try something.
Fuck them.
What are you, sick?
I know you, all right?
You can't even ride a bike.
How do you expect to land this thing?
It don't even--
It don't even matter.
I'm not runnin' out like I always do.
I'm gonna face this shit.
If you wanna go, go.
If you goin', go.
You gotta pull this one.
Hey, don't be grabbin' my cord.
You gonna make my chute ejaculate prematurely,
Baby, watch your head.
Don't let that touch you.
- I got a dead pilot, man.
- Just go.
God damn!
Oh, my God!
Not like this.
Listen, Giselle...
in case something happens, there's something I need to get off my chest.
That night when you and I broke up.
I was on your porch.
I overheard you and your father arguing about college.
What do you mean, you're not goin' away to college?
It's too far, I want to stay here where Nashawn is.
You gotta go, I been waitin' 18 years for this day to have the house to myself.
I'm not going.
You always dreamed of going to NYU.
Now they're offering you a full scholarship.
You tellin' me you're not goin' because of some little poop butt ass nigga who can't even keep a job!
Dad, I'm sorry, but I can't leave Nashawn.
I love him and he loves me.
You are going to college.
You're not messin' up my plans.
I didn't want you to throw all that away because of me.
I can get $200 a month for that room.
I just want you to know that I'm sorry, Giselle.
- Hey, baby.
- I'm so sorry for hurting you.
Leaving you was the biggest mistake of my life.
For what it's worth...
I never stopped loving you.
You better get in there.
You got a plane to land.
Yeah.
Cool.
I'm cool.
I got it.
I got it right now.
Mayday.
SOS.
I said SOS.
Come down, selecta.
- Nashawn!
- What?
Are you gonna cut a demo or radio in?
I don't know what to say.
I got something.
Hello?
This is Nashawn Wade, owner of NWA Airlines.
Yes, sir, the black one.
No, don't hang up.
Hello?
Can you please help us?
We got a situation here.
My pilot died, and I got people on the back of my plane asking for help and--hello?
They put me on hold.
Due to the high number of calls, your estimated wait time
- is 45 minutes.
- What are you doing here?
We family, man.
We was in this from the beginning, we gonna ride this out to the end.
That's my nigga, man.
Look at my watch.
What's up, G?
Excuse me.
I represent three of the four white people on board.
I want to tell you fellas we are behind you 100%.
What?
Hunkee, please.
I'm just here to find the little black box so I can wrap my big, black ass around it.
If I have to ride that tiny, indestructible motherfucker 30,000 feet to safety, trust you'll hear bitch screamin'.
"Hi ho, Silver".
Where's the box?
I really want to thank y'all for giving me all this confidence.
- I really feel it, I do.
- You're welcome.
Somebody knows how to land this plane, this would be the time to speak.
I saw a show on the Discovery channel, but that was about motorcycles.
Take control of the plane.
What?
You have to disengage the autopilot.
How do you know that?
I used to date this pilot, and we would make love in the cockpit.
You haven't had an orgasm until you've had it during descent.
Bitch, can you land this plane?
Show me where it is, Blanca.
What is it?
I don't remember.
That's what I told you...
I need you to go to the back then.
No, hold on.
Last time I was here...
Here, here!
There it is.
Push it.
Somebody help her.
Okay, I gotta grab it.
Guess I had a little control right away.
I'm flyin', y'all.
Okay, what's next, Blanca?
I would...
Yes, the flaps!
The flaps!
Adjusting the flaps.
What's next?
I think it was... the trim.
I cannot hear her.
I got it.
I see what you're sayin'.
What's next?
I don't know.
This is where he usually pops the cork.
We are so fucked!
Don't panic, please.
You're gonna be okay.
You can't use that phone while we're on the plane.
Girl, please, they say that to rip you off.
They want you to use their phone.
- I am calling for some help.
- No, I'm telling you.
Don't be hardheaded.
Don't use that phone.
Fuck that!
Okay.
All right.
We back on track right now.
What next, Blanca?
The wheels.
Muggsy, pull the wheels down.
Grab the wheel and do it slow.
I feel it comin' down, y'all,
Oh, yes!
Oh, D.J., this is it!
It's gonna happen this time, baby.
We about to die, you got me tied up down here.
Damn it, I don't give a fuck.
We goin' to heaven with one last nut.
Nigga, stay focused!
Yeah!
I'm doin' it!
I told you it was the turbulence.
You don't want none of this.
Here we go.
We gonna land.
New York, here we go!
This is it right here.
That's the ground!
We made it.
We gonna live.
I did it.
We down.
You did it!
That's just what you do, cousin.
Exactly what I do!
You see what I'm sayin'?
I was so scared.
You crazy bitch!
Fuck this airline!
You know what, she was on the way out anyway.
- Forget her, baby.
You did it.
- I did.
Yeah, I can do that.
All right, y'all with the mushy stuff.
I'm a go check on the passengers.
- Y'all just too cute.
- My boy.
Maybe we should go, too.
We should check on 'em, too.
All right.
Come on.
What a day.
Wait a minute.
Hold that, sugar dumpling'.
I don't know what smells better-- the New York air or your magnificent perfume.
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.
Wait a minute.
That's an Adam's apple.
I'm a player, but I don't play that way.
Floor walker!
No, I...
- Hey, Muggs.
- Yo, cousin.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
We made it!
What kind of shit-- this is Central Park.
Where is Central Park?
It's in New York, ain't it?
You got JFK, LaGuardia, Newark--
What you need an airport for, you got all this grass?
Ain't this a bitch?
This nigga is pissin' on the plane!
That's your problem.
You always thinkin' on the nega--
Hell, no, I know they didn't just steal my damn rims.
That's what your punk ass get.
You know how hard it is to get 84-inch rims?
That's a big-ass tire for a little-ass plane and a short-ass nigga.
Why don't you go put a doughnut in your mouth?
I am going to sue your ass, I am gonna sue the airline...
That's all you do is complain.
It doesn't matter, I'm not gonna let you spoil this for me.
I tell you what, Muggs, take everybody upstairs.
Drinks on me.
Let's party!
And we did party.
Just like I told y'all-- we fly, we party and we land.
Pop, where'd you get the moves from?
Where do ya think you got 'em from, son?
Wow!
This is the bomb!
What?
What did I say?
Let's dance!
Ladies and gentlemen... marriage, according to the law of this country... is the union of one man with one woman... voluntarily entered into for life... to the exclusion of all others.
- Mickey here is...
- What's going on here?
What in God's name is happening here?
That is my wife!
- I love the suit.
- You married us last week.
You enjoy seeing me in a wedding dress, don't you?
Just a little bit.
What about a Spanish Prisoner?
We haven't done one of them in years.
We could always live together first, see how it goes.
We've got enough toasters, ain't we?
I'm sick of getting married every week.
- Next time, it can be someone else.
- What about a Leighton Buzzard?
Well, that was fun.
I haven't run like that since 1972.
- We screwed up, Michael.
- Yes, we did.
I talked to a man about a horse yesterday.
- No, Albert.
- No, Albie.
What do we do now, Mickey?
We keep calm and trust our talent.
Libation for a shocked body.
Who's that?
The woman you're gawping at, who is she?
She is "Mrs. Katherine Winterborn...
"recently divorced from Stephen Winterborn, businessman.
"She denied killing his dog in a fit of pique."
She killed the bloke's dog?
"In the ensuing divorce, she took her husband to the cleaners...
"leaving him the bare bones of their hotel and spa business...
"and an empty dog basket."
What am I thinking, Albert?
You're thinking about doing the Congreve.
I am indeed.
- What's the Congreve?
- William Congreve.
Playwright.
"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned
"Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned"
We're going to stitch up a vengeful woman.
Okay.
Danny, Stacie, book into Winterborn's London spa... and see what information you can get out of Katherine's former staff.
Katherine Winterborn emerged triumphant... from recent bitter divorce proceedings against Stephen Winterborn...
Who managed to maintain sole control of the Winterborn chain of spa hotels... which Stephen is about to float on the stock exchange.
Daniel, what did you learn?
Well, I spoke to one of the therapists.
Very sweet girl.
In my country, the water wouldn't be so warm.
Mrs. Winterborn was a stickler for discipline.
Strict.
Aloof.
Cruel when she felt like it.
Sacked staff at the drop of a hat.
But very good at her business.
Stacie?
Anything else?
She had a very volatile relationship with her husband.
One day she cut up all his suits and he retaliated by ripping up all her drawings.
They had a row.
He went away on a business trip... and she had his Labrador put down by the vet.
Shouldn't have killed that dog.
- So the dog was the last straw?
- No, the lift was the last straw.
She took an ax to his favorite car, he goes mad, locks her in a lift.
You can't really blame him, after the dog.
Except he knew that she was claustrophobic.
She pushed him so far, he eventually flipped.
Gave her everything at the divorce settlement... just kept the spa-hotel chain.
All right.
Tell me about the drawings.
She attends art classes twice a week.
Crazy about it.
I think I'm going to enjoy this.
Yeah.
Well, you be careful, Albie, because she is a real psycho bitch.
What are you doing, Eddie?
Found this old cocktail book down the Charing Cross Road.
- Angel's Tit.
Do you want one?
- No, thank you.
Incredible.
Moment of pure joy.
When he was younger, Albert was the doyen of the Congreve.
He could smell out a vengeful woman like a pig with a truffle.
What a man.
Excuse me.
- Where are you off to, Ash?
- Out.
You got a mystery woman stashed away?
Yeah, we're not good enough for her, Ash?
Where does he keep going off to?
That's his business.
I wonder how Albie is getting on.
Excuse me.
It's my first time.
I'm a little nervous.
Are you talking to me?
- Yeah.
I was saying it's my first time.
- Please don't.
Good evening.
Let's make a start, people.
- Damien?
Welcome to the class.
- Thank you.
So, if you won't mind undressing, we'll get started.
- Excuse me?
- Please.
The new boy or girl, they always model on their first class.
- It's just our little tradition.
- Okay.
Damien, your robe?
Mickey.
You remember June, don't you?
Yeah, thanks.
Mickey Stone.
You look fabulous.
- So do you.
- Liar.
What happened, June?
Too many years head-butting moving vehicles.
She was doing the flop up until a month ago.
The plate in her head moved...
That's too bad.
- But Ash has been looking after you?
- Only the best.
Tell him I'm not his responsibility.
That ended the day we divorced.
Sorry, I can't do that, June.
Besides, it wouldn't be true.
Not you, too?
You're family.
And families take responsibility.
And they share that responsibility.
I wanted to tell you, but...
- Ash?
- Yes, love?
- Who's that man?
- Why, that's Mickey.
- You remember Mickey.
- Get him out!
It's okay.
- That wasn't exactly what I expected.
- Really?
May I see?
It's good.
I'm always looking for fresh blood, a fresh eye.
I own a small gallery in Knightsbridge.
Is that supposed to impress me?
Not at all.
I just thought you might...
I'm an amateur.
I know what I am.
Not from looking at your work tonight.
I would actually disagree.
Then you're an idiot.
Believe me, I'm never wrong about these things.
Perhaps I could take you out for a cup of...
We could...
Do you know why I come to this drawing class?
I imagine because...
It's the one thing I do where I can lose myself for a blissful hour.
If I wanted an elderly roué with an art gallery hitting on me...
I'd go to Venice.
Do you understand?
- Perfectly.
- Good.
Some days she's fine.
Then, suddenly, the fog will come down and she gets confused, upset.
She will get better?
It's partial brain damage, Mickey.
And you've been paying for that home all this time?
Yeah, until the end of next week.
Then the money runs out.
Then what happens?
- There are cheaper places.
- No way.
Not for June.
I remember when you two married.
It just wasn't something we ever did.
Well, you married Rachel.
Yeah, I know.
But she wasn't one of us, you know.
And I remember what you said:
"Just because we do what we do doesn't mean we have to be lonely."
I admired you for saying that.
Are you going to tell the others?
She's going to get the best care there is, Ash... which means we're going to need a lot of money.
But don't worry.
Albert is out there doing the business.
We'll be all right.
Katherine Winterborn is an ogre of gargantuan amplitude.
You still think she's our mark?
She's rich, she's bitter... and with the right key, she'll open up like a butterfly.
Any boyfriends?
No.
At least none that we know of.
That would be like sleeping with a Nile crocodile.
Well, there's your in, then.
- You think?
- I know.
What, sex?
Wait.
Please, just a second.
June means a lot to me.
I proved that...
No, not you, Albie.
You're far too precious to be sullied in that way.
Sorry, put your trousers on.
I'm ready and I'm bang up for it.
No, we don't send boys to do a man's job.
Right, Michael?
No, we do not.
Mickey can spin his charm and still keep his trousers on.
It's his great gift.
You two go back to the spa, get every piece of information you can.
I'll arrange a meeting with Katherine Winterborn.
- I'm looking for Mr. Elliot.
- Mrs. Winterborn?
He said to say to meet you in the Horizon Lounge.
- Where are the stairs?
- It's on the 40th floor, madam.
The lifts are just through there.
- Problem with the middle lift, I hear.
- Excuse me?
We got a report from the duty manager that the left central lift was juddering.
News to me.
Let me call him.
It'll take me five minutes.
I can't just leave it.
Either I fix it or I shut it down.
It's all the same to me, sir.
- Go on.
- All right.
Mrs. Winterborn.
Sorry.
What's happening?
Hello?
Sorry about this, sir.
I'll have you moving in a while.
Quick as you can, please.
I'm late for a meeting.
Isn't that always the way?
Are you all right?
No, I don't do lifts very well.
Can you hurry them, please?
Look, could you hurry it up?
There's a lady in here feeling unwell.
Yeah, it shouldn't be too long now.
- What are you doing?
- You're panicking.
Now look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Think of nothing and no one else.
- I'm going to be sick.
- Look at me.
Here.
Very good.
Now, think, you're very calm.
You're by a river bank.
The sun is dappling the water.
The water is dark green and very cool.
There's a breeze playing with the rushes.
Can you hear it?
Yeah?
Very good.
You're very calm as you sit by the bank and splash your feet in the water.
Can you feel the cold water against your skin?
Very good.
I spoke to the duty manager.
There was this American businessman in New York.
Or maybe it was Chicago.
Who called your company?
He got stuck in a lift for three hours.
No ventilation, no air con.
When they finally got him out, his heart had exploded like a crisp packet.
Just hurry up and finish.
Terrible, it was.
We're moving.
We are.
We're okay.
Stay with me.
Now we're gonna stand up, okay?
You're doing very well.
Here we go.
Very calm.
Breathe in and out.
That's very good.
- You're gonna be all right now?
- Yes, thank you.
I think you owe this lady an apology.
As far as I'm concerned, if I lose any money... because I'm late for this meeting, I will send you the bill.
You forgot this.
Thank you.
- And I wanted to thank you properly.
- There's no need, really.
I liked your river.
Your river.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
- You're late for your meeting.
- Yes.
Can I buy you dinner tonight as a thank-you?
I'd be delighted.
Patrick Greene.
- Now get to your meeting.
- Yes.
Orange juice.
Ice.
Mineral-water ice cubes?
Look, how many times do I have to tell you people... we don't do that anymore.
Sorry, sir, I didn't know.
Don't make me tell you again.
Sorry about that.
Can you imagine that?
Mineral-water ice cubes?
A bit extreme.
- Everything all right for you here?
- Great.
Everything's perfect.
- You the manager?
- No, I'm the owner.
- Stephen Winterborn.
- Cindy Moore.
- Lovely place you've got here.
- Thank you.
Didn't I read somewhere... you're floating your business on the stock exchange?
You must read the very small print on the financial pages.
I do.
Yeah, we're about to go public.
Exciting.
I hope so.
What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?
I work in the city.
- Really?
Doing what?
- Stephen.
- Nice to meet you, Miss Moore.
- Likewise.
Good luck with the launch.
- What can I get you?
- Dry martini.
- Sir?
- Where's your still water from?
- England, sir.
- Where in England?
- Herefordshire.
- That's fine.
No lemon.
Two mineral-water ice cubes.
Sorry, sir, we only have regular ice cubes.
Made from water that has gone through at least seven human beings.
No ice, thank you.
- What were you doing in Hong Kong?
- Making money... seeing which way the wind would blow once the Chinese took it back.
- Which way is it blowing?
- Back to London.
What about you?
What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?
- You don't know who I am?
- Should I?
Every other person in here would.
I'm the evil bitch who killed her ex-husband's dog.
I read about that.
The press didn't like you very much, did they?
I'll get over it, given time.
You can run away now.
I won't be offended.
I'm fine where I am.
It's funny though.
- Don't you want to know about the dog?
- You'll tell me if you want to.
Excuse me, sir.
Your table's ready.
When did you start at the spa?
Three months ago.
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.
You're pretty good with these balls.
You're a natural.
Let me get just a nice firm grip on the end there.
So who got you in the job in the first place?
Let me push it through.
Ready?
- Wow.
- Together.
- You ask a lot of questions.
- Do I?
- Can I ask you one?
- Yeah, fire away.
What are you doing here?
Just playing with balls with you.
Where is your sister?
She's at the theater with some friends.
- That's a shame.
- Why?
She's pretty.
She could have come with us.
- Where are we going?
- To my place.
She wanted things I couldn't give her.
So she found someone who could.
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Yeah, like a razor.
Kids?
She wouldn't have them until I'd become what she wanted.
Would you take her back if she asked?
No, I could never give her the things that she wants.
That wasn't the question.
You said it was funny.
What's funny?
I told you about my business and you said it was funny.
- Oh, yeah.
A coincidence.
- Tell me.
It's business.
We don't want to talk business.
I like talking business.
I'm setting up a luxury hotel complex in the southeast.
We're starting with one, but we'll create a major chain within five years.
You sound very confident.
It's a hard business to get right.
Some British businessmen in Hong Kong are ready to come home... and this is what they want to do.
Each man has put in a minimum stake of £100,000... and my job is to get it up and running.
You'd be in direct competition with my ex-husband.
- Sorry about that.
- Don't be.
I think it's hilarious.
- How much more money do you need?
- We're all sorted.
- Fully funded?
- Why?
Thinking of irritating your ex-husband?
That would be petty, wouldn't it?
So he didn't serve your heart on a bed of asparagus, huh?
No, not when she realized she could use me to get back at her husband.
- She's an interesting woman.
- Interesting?
What did you talk about?
Life, love, exes.
You talked to her about Rachel?
- You don't even talk to us about her.
- She asked.
Where's Danny?
He's working the Russian girl from the spa.
She must be interesting, too.
- Any hits yet, Ash?
- No, not yet.
You're going?
Yeah, I gotta go.
I'm sorry.
Back to your sister.
Yeah, well, you know, she does worry.
Leave the money on the table.
Excuse me?
£200.
- You want money?
- Of course.
You're not a hooker, are you?
I don't mind what word you use.
Hang on a minute.
I thought we were, you know...
You thought what?
- I can't pay for sex.
- Why not?
Because I'm, you know...
I mean, you know, it's not...
I'm not a payer-for-sexer.
Well, you have to.
If you don't, they'll cut me.
Who will?
People I work for.
She's in.
- Where's she off to?
- Photograph of company directors.
She likes you.
I do believe we have her.
Let's begin stage two.
Well, what about that one?
Look at his shoes.
Handmade.
Probably Jermyn Street.
It'll take too long to bleed him dry.
Well, I think...
Oh, lovely.
What about that one?
Too pretty.
Pretty girls don't play poker.
I can't believe you said that.
There's your mark.
Bohemian chic, roll-ups, odd socks.
Thinks he's an existentialist.
Be like shooting a fish in a bowl.
I'll see you later then.
Great.
Just what we're looking for.
I've got the number for the managing agents.
- Have you?
- Yes.
I hate managing agents, Brian.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
But I've decided I like you.
I like you very much.
Most architecture students are only interested in building skyscrapers... and monuments to corporate greed.
Me, I'm about bringing great design to the underclass.
Absolutely.
Yeah, they're crying out for it.
- What are you studying?
- I'm sort of...
Psychology.
That's a bit bourgeois.
You might say that, but, you know, know your enemy.
Through a study of human psychology...
I want to invert, to subvert, the mind of the international capitalists.
Laugh away, but let me just give you an example of that.
Never been very good with cards.
I just...
It's the thing you got to clip...
Sorry, can't shuffle.
I'm gonna take five cards off the top here, which I haven't seen.
Fair enough.
But take them.
Just hold onto them.
Put them in your hand, yeah?
From my knowledge of you, I'm going to be able to tell... just from reading your face, which is the highest card... in that hand.
You ever been hypnotized?
Okay, just look at me.
Look at the cards, relax.
The first one is the highest.
Sometimes it takes a while.
Don't block me, all right?
Look at me.
The third card is the highest one.
What you got left?
It does work sometimes, but I'm in the first year.
You are pretty good with cards, aren't you?
Now, don't lie to me, I can tell.
No, you're good.
We should have a game of...
What's it called?
Poker.
Ready?
Right, I'm gonna put £20 down.
How many do you want?
I got £20.
- Time for me to get out.
- Check.
£20.
In.
I'll go for £10.
£20.
I'm out.
I'm out.
So what have you got?
Jack high.
Two pairs.
Must be beginner's luck.
Which also means that you owe me quite a lot of money.
You've cleaned me out, man.
So are you any good?
You know, like, being an architect?
The best in my year.
Look, I'll put my watch into the mix.
I don't want your watch.
I don't have anything else.
There must be something you have that I want... some skill that you possess that I don't.
Like what?
These are good, Danny.
He can't play cards, but he does draw a lovely building.
Michael.
Here we go.
Showtime.
I'd like to see Mr. Greene, please.
Do you have an appointment?
Just tell him Mrs. Winterborn is here to see him.
That's quite all right, Sharon.
Hello again.
Come this way.
I thought about you last night.
It was a good night, wasn't it?
Please have a seat.
I'd like to see your site.
- What for?
- Professional interest.
You know it's fully invested?
I'd still like to see your site.
Okay.
That would be the main accommodation block there.
Restaurant.
Pool.
- Outdoor or indoor?
- One outdoor, one indoor... both flanked by the treatment rooms.
It's a beautiful place.
Good road and rail access.
Airport in half an hour.
- Planning permission?
- All sorted.
- Staff?
- Already started headhunting.
Hard to find good people.
Yeah, but not impossible.
Your ex-husband has loads.
I'd like to see your architect.
- But we've discussed this...
- Indulge me.
Call it professional interest.
This way.
I'm impressed you got planning permission.
- It wasn't easy.
- Bugger off!
You're trespassing!
Get off!
All I'd say is don't scrimp in the building and development.
It's easy to do, the costs spiral... and the marble effect looks nearly as good as real marble.
Don't do it.
And definitely don't cut costs in the bedrooms.
They should be better than guests have at home, not worse.
Furnishings.
It will be unrivaled, I give you my word.
And on opening day you can be my guest of honor.
I'd love to see his face when he finds out I'm involved with the competition.
- He will be furious.
- But, Katherine, with all due respect... you're not involved with the competition.
I'm going to invest £100,000 in your business.
You can't do that.
No one knows more about this than me.
Let me invest £100,000 and I'll be your consultant for free.
- Are you sure it's what you want?
- Positive.
I'll bring the papers over tomorrow.
- Two glasses of champagne, please.
- Okay.
Okay, furnishings.
Good.
Would you put that straight in the van?
Brian, thank you so much.
You're a star.
Thank you for that.
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.
What made you change your mind?
For months now, the first image in my head when I wake... is of him and his little girlfriend, smiling and laughing... enjoying the lifestyle I've created.
I hate him.
I want to hurt him.
Katherine, all you have to do...
But that's no way to live the rest of my life.
Eaten away with anger and bitterness.
That way he wins again.
It would have been fun to work with you, I'm sure of that... but it would have been wrong for me.
I need a fresh start and this isn't it.
I'm sorry.
- I can't persuade you?
- I know you won't even try.
I hope it works out for you.
Thank you.
I owe you a lot.
About the dog, it was hit by a car... and was in great distress.
The vet said it should be put down, and I made that decision.
So you let her walk away?
I gave her an out, like always.
This time she took it.
How hard did you try and persuade her?
That's the point.
A lot of work has gone into this, Michael.
People have expectations.
The great Mickey Bricks, falling for a mark.
It's a question of ethics.
- Ethics?
What bloody ethics?
- Calm down.
- We're con men, for Christ's sake!
- We do not cheat honest people.
What about June?
We'll think of something.
We always do.
- Fancy a Slow Comfortable Screw, Ash?
- No, thanks, Eddie.
Hello?
Sorry to phone you so late, Mrs. Winterborn.
But I'm afraid that the midwife won't be able to get out to you in the morning.
- What midwife?
- The district midwife.
I think you must have the wrong number.
Mrs. Stephen Winterborn.
Date of birth:
September 13, 1983.
Your husband brought you in yesterday, according to our records.
Mr. Winterborn no longer resides at this address.
Never call this number again.
What made you change your mind?
When I was 23, I got pregnant.
It was a complete accident, unplanned.
But when I found out, I was so happy.
I told Stephen and he just said:
"But we're not going to have children.
We agreed."
And he was right.
We agreed the business would come first.
But I couldn't help feeling elated.
What happened?
We talked about it.
He decided...
He bullied me until I had an abortion.
And that was that for me.
I'm sorry.
Now I hear he's got his little tart pregnant.
I'll give you £100,000 worth of investment... and you give me free rein over the spa.
I'll make it sparkle.
How did you find out she was pregnant?
I got a call by mistake from the hospital.
What time was this?
Late last night.
Don't go.
I have to.
I haven't signed the contract.
And you're not going to.
What do you mean, Patrick?
It's just not the right thing for you to do.
I don't understand.
Trust me on this.
When am I going to see you again?
Katherine, you're never going to see me again.
Why?
That's just the way it has to be.
I'm sorry.
You're done with me, are you?
Stupid, bitter woman, good for a shag and a few quid?
There is no hotel, Katherine.
No spa, no investors.
My name is not Patrick.
Some associates and myself picked you out as a potential victim.
You were rich, bitter, angry, obsessed.
You were ripe to be plucked.
You're a con man.
But I will not let you be our mark.
I won't be a part of it.
Wait.
You were setting me up.
I was.
You con people for money, that's what you're saying?
You're all the same, all of you.
£200,000.
- I'll give you £200,000.
- There is no spa.
Who said anything about a spa?
I want you to destroy my ex-husband.
A rat to catch a rat.
- Don't do this.
- £250,000.
What's your price, scumbag?
I want to see him humiliated.
No, it's not what we do.
It's one thing conning a nasty piece of work.
She is a nasty piece of work.
It's quite another destroying a man's life for a fee.
What's this bloke like she wants to destroy?
- He's all right.
A bit full of himself, but...
- No, he's not pleasant, actually.
Forced her to have an abortion... ran off with a younger model, and promptly got her pregnant.
- You haven't even met him.
- I know his type.
Then why are we talking about it?
If he's that bad, he doesn't sound any different from any other con.
And there's June to think about.
No, she wouldn't want us to do anything just because of her.
I would, though.
Okay, then we have to move fast.
He's floating his business in two days.
- That's when we get him.
- What's the in?
I have no idea.
He's a very careful man, by all accounts.
- Women?
- He's had two in his whole life.
Revenge.
If we let him know his wife is setting him up for a fall... we might hook him in that way.
- I don't want her involved.
- Bloody hell, Mickey.
There must be something.
A hole in his wall.
We don't have very long to find it.
You wanna keep your voice down?
The great Danny Blue paid for it with a Russian hooker.
- How much was it, Danny?
- Can you please just shut up?
Is it enough?
A prostitution racket being run from his hotel spa?
Lt'll crucify him.
- So what do we do now?
- We need proof.
No.
No way.
Come on, you did it once.
What's the difference?
I didn't know she was a hooker then, did I?
I've got a reputation to think of.
Every silver cane has a grubby end, Danny.
- And when needs must...
- You grab the grubby end, Danny boy.
- No.
- Danny, we need you.
If you can't get something concrete from this woman... this whole thing falls down.
All right.
But, I mean it, listen, no one is to know anything about this.
Cheers, Danny.
Eddie, Danny pays for sex.
Taxi!
Hello!
Stephen Winterborn.
We met at one of my spas.
Oh, yeah.
Hi.
Of course.
The man who hates mineral-water ice cubes.
- Which way are you heading?
- Back to the city.
Me, too.
Shall we share the cab?
Yeah, okay.
You never told me what you did in the city.
- You never asked.
- I did, actually.
I monitor new flotations.
Advise my board whether they should invest in them or not.
What would you advise your board about me?
I don't know, really.
I normally follow much bigger flotations than yours.
- No offense.
- None taken.
So where are you having the launch?
Went to a lovely one at the Docklands.
At the spa.
- Nice.
- You think I should have done more?
The most important thing is the presentation.
I got my usual PR firm to knock something up.
"Knock something up"?
Stephen, this is the most important moment of your business life.
I've got a friend I think you should meet.
They're early.
The man is nothing short of astonishing.
Cindy, what on earth are you doing here?
I want you to meet my friend.
I've heard great things about you, Mr. Cavendish.
I'm working.
Sorry.
He's a brilliant PR, but very rude.
I want you to have a look at Stephen's presentation.
Now why would I want to do that?
Because I'm asking you nicely.
... experience, which pampers and relaxes... while at the same time, refreshes and energizes.
Each of our spas offers a unique experience.
But the one thing they have in common is indulgence.
Winterborns Hotel and Spas.
- What do you think?
- Very nice.
Reminds me of those ads you have in provincial cinemas.
"The Taj Mahal Indian Restaurant, just moments from this cinema."
Mr. Cavendish, can't you just fizz it up a bit?
No, I don't do fizz.
Come on, Mr. Cavendish.
I'll make it worth your while.
So, what's up?
Open it.
So how many of the other girls are turning tricks?
Only the Russian ones, and the Lithuanians.
And the Ukrainian girl.
What would the management do if they found out?
They're the ones who organized it.
You sure about that?
The Mafia guy in Moscow told me there is a job opportunity in England...
- and I jumped at it.
- The Mafia?
So the management of the hotel are making a lot of money out of you girls.
We have to service at least three clients a week.
Service?
- Nervous?
- A bit.
Don't be.
It's all under control.
And I hear it's a big year for you.
You and Charlotte.
The pitter-patter of tiny feet.
- Who told you that?
- I heard it on the grapevine.
It's highly unlikely.
I've never been able to have children.
Excuse me.
For God's sake, be more bloody careful.
Lovely night for an execution.
- No doubts?
- He's a bastard.
This is how you deal with bastards.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Thank you all for coming.
Tonight is the proudest night of my life... to be surrounded by friends, honored guests, and the woman I love.
It's taken a lot of people a lot of work to get where we are tonight.
I want to thank them all from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you very much, everybody.
But tonight is just a start, the first step on a magnificent journey.
And now a short presentation.
Enjoy.
Winterborns Hotel and Spas, a retreat away from daily life.
- Something doesn't smell right.
- What is it?
Stephen said that he can't have children.
- No, he told her to have an abortion.
- I know.
Somebody's lying.
Who?
Yeah, speaking.
Wait, I can't hear you.
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
Bloke from the office says he found the earring you lost.
- But I haven't lost an earring.
- She hasn't lost an earring.
Which one?
It's not the nice lady.
It's the nasty lady.
Okay, thank you.
She went back to find the earring.
I was here earlier.
Well, at least I think I was.
I dropped an earring.
- There's nobody here.
- Where is everyone?
They were only here for a day.
Nice people, though.
She's known who we are all along.
This is how you deal with bastards.
Our beauty therapists are specially trained.
From all corners of the former Soviet Union, they come to work... to work as prostitutes.
The Mafia guy in Moscow told me there was a job opportunity in England... and I jumped at it.
They cannot speak out without fear of violence and punishment.
Winterborns, where exploitation...
- Ash, stop it.
- It's too late.
I can't.
We're destroying an innocent man.
For Christ's sake, will you stop the presentation?
I don't know anything about that.
I'll try and explain this as well as I can.
Watch the suit.
None of this is true.
I know nothing about this.
Excuse me.
How could you do this to me?
Why?
Lovely night for an execution.
I owe you all an apology.
I let my guard down, and I got caught.
And the con man got conned.
Never let a mark get under your skin.
I know, and I'm sorry.
I promise you all it will never happen again.
Anyway, what about the £250,000?
It's in our account, every penny.
- Have you told June?
- Yeah.
- Mickey, I just want to...
- No, Ash.
She's family.
I spoke to my friendly DI in Vice... told her Stephen Winterborn knew nothing about the prostitution racket.
So at least he won't be charged.
Thanks, Stacie.
But they'll charge Mickey's woman for running a brothel out of the spa.
Yeah, if they can find her.
She's emptied her accounts and left the country.
What a woman.
She really had you fooled, didn't she?
- Okay, I made an error of judgment.
- Yes, you did.
"Say what you will, 'tis better to be left
"Than never to have loved"
William Congreve, playwright.
Oh, no.
- What is this, Eddie?
- The Congreve.
It's made with a lot of bitters.
Get it?
Bitters.
Bitter women.
I'd like to propose a toast.
- To living and learning.
- To falling in love with marks.
At least he didn't have to pay, Danny.
What's the toast, Ash?
To family.
That's disgusting.
English
Ladies and gentlemen... marriage, according to the law of this country... is the union of one man with one woman... voluntarily entered into for life... to the exclusion of all others.
- Mickey here is...
- What's going on here?
What in God's name is happening here?
- I love the suit.
- You married us last week.
You enjoy seeing me in a wedding dress, don't you?
Just a little bit.
What about a Spanish Prisoner?
We haven't done one of them in years.
We could always live together first, see how it goes.
We've got enough toasters, ain't we?
I'm sick of getting married every week.
- Next time, it can be someone else.
- What about a Leighton Buzzard?
Well, that was fun.
I haven't run like that since 1972.
- We screwed up, Michael.
- Yes, we did.
I talked to a man about a horse yesterday.
- No, Albert.
- No, Albie.
What do we do now, Mickey?
We keep calm and trust our talent.
Libation for a shocked body.
Who's that?
The woman you're gawping at, who is she?
She is "Mrs. Katherine Winterborn...
"recently divorced from Stephen Winterborn, businessman.
"She denied killing his dog in a fit of pique. "
She killed the bloke's dog?
"In the ensuing divorce, she took her husband to the cleaners...
"leaving him the bare bones of their hotel and spa business...
"and an empty dog basket. "
What am I thinking, Albert?
You're thinking about doing the Congreve.
I am indeed.
- What's the Congreve?
- William Congreve.
Playwright.
"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned
"Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned"
We're going to stitch up a vengeful woman.
Okay.
Danny, Stacie, book into Winterborn's London spa... and see what information you can get out of Katherine's former staff.
Katherine Winterborn emerged triumphant... from recent bitter divorce proceedings against Stephen Winterborn...
Who managed to maintain sole control of the Winterborn chain of spa hotels... which Stephen is about to float on the stock exchange.
Daniel, what did you learn?
Well, I spoke to one of the therapists.
Very sweet girl.
In my country, the water wouldn't be so warm.
Mrs. Winterborn was a stickler for discipline.
Strict.
Aloof.
Cruel when she felt like it.
Sacked staff at the drop of a hat.
But very good at her business.
Stacie?
Anything else?
She had a very volatile relationship with her husband.
One day she cut up all his suits and he retaliated by ripping up all her drawings.
They had a row.
He went away on a business trip... and she had his Labrador put down by the vet.
Shouldn't have killed that dog.
- So the dog was the last straw?
- No, the lift was the last straw.
She took an ax to his favorite car, he goes mad, locks her in a lift.
You can't really blame him, after the dog.
Except he knew that she was claustrophobic.
She pushed him so far, he eventually flipped.
Gave her everything at the divorce settlement... just kept the spa-hotel chain.
All right.
Tell me about the drawings.
She attends art classes twice a week.
Crazy about it.
I think I'm going to enjoy this.
Yeah.
Well, you be careful, Albie, because she is a real psycho bitch.
Excuse me.
It's my first time.
I'm a little nervous.
Are you talking to me?
- Yeah.
I was saying it's my first time.
- Please don't.
Good evening.
Let's make a start, people.
- Damien?
Welcome to the class.
- Thank you.
So, if you won't mind undressing, we'll get started.
- Excuse me?
- Please.
The new boy or girl, they always model on their first class.
- It's just our little tradition.
- Okay.
What are you doing, Eddie?
Found this old cocktail book down the Charing Cross Road.
- Angel's Tit.
Do you want one?
- No, thank you.
Incredible.
Moment of pure joy.
When he was younger, Albert was the doyen of the Congreve.
He could smell out a vengeful woman like a pig with a truffle.
What a man.
Excuse me.
- Where are you off to, Ash?
- Out.
You got a mystery woman stashed away?
Yeah, we're not good enough for her, Ash?
Where does he keep going off to?
That's his business.
I wonder how Albie is getting on.
Damien, your robe?
Mickey.
You remember June, don't you?
Yeah, thanks.
Mickey Stone.
You look fabulous.
- So do you.
- Liar.
What happened, June?
Too many years head-butting moving vehicles.
She was doing the flop up until a month ago.
The plate in her head moved...
That's too bad.
- But Ash has been looking after you?
- Only the best.
Tell him I'm not his responsibility.
That ended the day we divorced.
Sorry, I can't do that, June.
Besides, it wouldn't be true.
Not you, too?
You're family.
And families take responsibility.
And they share that responsibility.
I wanted to tell you, but...
- Ash?
- Yes, love?
- Who's that man?
- Why, that's Mickey.
- You remember Mickey.
- Get him out!
It's okay.
- That wasn't exactly what I expected.
- Really?
May I see?
It's good.
I'm always looking for fresh blood, a fresh eye.
I own a small gallery in Knightsbridge.
Is that supposed to impress me?
Not at all.
I just thought you might...
I'm an amateur.
I know what I am.
Not from looking at your work tonight.
I would actually disagree.
Then you're an idiot.
Believe me, I'm never wrong about these things.
Perhaps I could take you out for a cup of...
We could...
Do you know why I come to this drawing class?
I imagine because...
It's the one thing I do where I can lose myself for a blissful hour.
If I wanted an elderly roué with an art gallery hitting on me...
I'd go to Venice.
Do you understand?
- Perfectly.
- Good.
Some days she's fine.
Then, suddenly, the fog will come down and she gets confused, upset.
She will get better?
It's partial brain damage, Mickey.
And you've been paying for that home all this time?
Yeah, until the end of next week.
Then the money runs out.
Then what happens?
- There are cheaper places.
- No way.
Not for June.
I remember when you two married.
It just wasn't something we ever did.
Well, you married Rachel.
Yeah, I know.
But she wasn't one of us, you know.
And I remember what you said:
"Just because we do what we do doesn't mean we have to be lonely. "
I admired you for saying that.
Are you going to tell the others?
She's going to get the best care there is, Ash... which means we're going to need a lot of money.
But don't worry.
Albert is out there doing the business.
We'll be all right.
Katherine Winterborn is an ogre of gargantuan amplitude.
You still think she's our mark?
She's rich, she's bitter... and with the right key, she'll open up like a butterfly.
Any boyfriends?
No.
At least none that we know of.
That would be like sleeping with a Nile crocodile.
Well, there's your in, then.
- You think?
- I know.
What, sex?
Wait.
Please, just a second.
June means a lot to me.
I proved that...
No, not you, Albie.
You're far too precious to be sullied in that way.
Sorry, put your trousers on.
I'm ready and I'm bang up for it.
No, we don't send boys to do a man's job.
Right, Michael?
No, we do not.
Mickey can spin his charm and still keep his trousers on.
It's his great gift.
You two go back to the spa, get every piece of information you can.
I'll arrange a meeting with Katherine Winterborn.
- I'm looking for Mr. Elliot.
- Mrs. Winterborn?
He said to say to meet you in the Horizon Lounge.
- Where are the stairs?
- It's on the 40th floor, madam.
The lifts are just through there.
- Problem with the middle lift, I hear.
- Excuse me?
We got a report from the duty manager that the left central lift was juddering.
News to me.
Let me call him.
It'll take me five minutes.
I can't just leave it.
Either I fix it or I shut it down.
It's all the same to me, sir.
- Go on.
- All right.
Mrs. Winterborn.
Sorry.
What's happening?
Hello?
Sorry about this, sir.
I'll have you moving in a while.
Quick as you can, please.
I'm late for a meeting.
Isn't that always the way?
Are you all right?
No, I don't do lifts very well.
Can you hurry them, please?
Look, could you hurry it up?
There's a lady in here feeling unwell.
Yeah, it shouldn't be too long now.
- What are you doing?
- You're panicking.
Now look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Think of nothing and no one else.
- I'm going to be sick.
- Look at me.
Here.
Very good.
Now, think, you're very calm.
You're by a river bank.
The sun is dappling the water.
The water is dark green and very cool.
There's a breeze playing with the rushes.
Can you hear it?
Yeah?
Very good.
You're very calm as you sit by the bank and splash your feet in the water.
Can you feel the cold water against your skin?
Very good.
I spoke to the duty manager.
There was this American businessman in New York.
Or maybe it was Chicago.
Who called your company?
He got stuck in a lift for three hours.
No ventilation, no air con.
When they finally got him out, his heart had exploded like a crisp packet.
Just hurry up and finish.
Terrible, it was.
We're moving.
We are.
We're okay.
Stay with me.
Now we're gonna stand up, okay?
You're doing very well.
Here we go.
Very calm.
Breathe in and out.
That's very good.
- You're gonna be all right now?
- Yes, thank you.
I think you owe this lady an apology.
As far as I'm concerned, if I lose any money... because I'm late for this meeting, I will send you the bill.
You forgot this.
Thank you.
- And I wanted to thank you properly.
- There's no need, really.
I liked your river.
Your river.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
- You're late for your meeting.
- Yes.
Can I buy you dinner tonight as a thank-you?
I'd be delighted.
Patrick Greene.
- Now get to your meeting.
- Yes.
Orange juice.
Ice.
Mineral-water ice cubes?
Look, how many times do I have to tell you people... we don't do that anymore.
Sorry, sir, I didn't know.
Don't make me tell you again.
Sorry about that.
Can you imagine that?
Mineral-water ice cubes?
A bit extreme.
- Everything all right for you here?
- Great.
Everything's perfect.
- You the manager?
- No, I'm the owner.
- Stephen Winterborn.
- Cindy Moore.
- Lovely place you've got here.
- Thank you.
Didn't I read somewhere... you're floating your business on the stock exchange?
You must read the very small print on the financial pages.
I do.
Yeah, we're about to go public.
Exciting.
I hope so.
What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?
I work in the city.
- Really?
Doing what?
- Stephen.
- Nice to meet you, Miss Moore.
- Likewise.
Good luck with the launch.
- What can I get you?
- Dry martini.
- Sir?
- Where's your still water from?
- England, sir.
- Where in England?
- Herefordshire.
- That's fine.
No lemon.
Two mineral-water ice cubes.
Sorry, sir, we only have regular ice cubes.
Made from water that has gone through at least seven human beings.
No ice, thank you.
- What were you doing in Hong Kong?
- Making money... seeing which way the wind would blow once the Chinese took it back.
- Which way is it blowing?
- Back to London.
What about you?
What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?
- You don't know who I am?
- Should I?
Every other person in here would.
I'm the evil bitch who killed her ex-husband's dog.
I read about that.
The press didn't like you very much, did they?
I'll get over it, given time.
You can run away now.
I won't be offended.
I'm fine where I am.
It's funny though.
- Don't you want to know about the dog?
- You'll tell me if you want to.
Excuse me, sir.
Your table's ready.
When did you start at the spa?
Three months ago.
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.
You're pretty good with these balls.
You're a natural.
Let me get just a nice firm grip on the end there.
So who got you in the job in the first place?
Let me push it through.
Ready?
- Wow.
- Together.
- You ask a lot of questions.
- Do I?
- Can I ask you one?
- Yeah, fire away.
What are you doing here?
Just playing with balls with you.
Where is your sister?
She's at the theater with some friends.
- That's a shame.
- Why?
She's pretty.
She could have come with us.
- Where are we going?
- To my place.
She wanted things I couldn't give her.
So she found someone who could.
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Yeah, like a razor.
Kids?
She wouldn't have them until I'd become what she wanted.
Would you take her back if she asked?
No, I could never give her the things that she wants.
That wasn't the question.
You said it was funny.
What's funny?
I told you about my business and you said it was funny.
- Oh, yeah.
A coincidence.
- Tell me.
It's business.
We don't want to talk business.
I like talking business.
I'm setting up a luxury hotel complex in the southeast.
We're starting with one, but we'll create a major chain within five years.
You sound very confident.
It's a hard business to get right.
Some British businessmen in Hong Kong are ready to come home... and this is what they want to do.
Each man has put in a minimum stake of £100,000... and my job is to get it up and running.
You'd be in direct competition with my ex-husband.
- Sorry about that.
- Don't be.
I think it's hilarious.
- How much more money do you need?
- We're all sorted.
- Fully funded?
- Why?
Thinking of irritating your ex-husband?
That would be petty, wouldn't it?
So he didn't serve your heart on a bed of asparagus, huh?
No, not when she realized she could use me to get back at her husband.
- She's an interesting woman.
- Interesting?
What did you talk about?
Life, love, exes.
You talked to her about Rachel?
- You don't even talk to us about her.
- She asked.
Where's Danny?
He's working the Russian girl from the spa.
She must be interesting, too.
- Any hits yet, Ash?
- No, not yet.
You're going?
Yeah, I gotta go.
I'm sorry.
Back to your sister.
Yeah, well, you know, she does worry.
Leave the money on the table.
Excuse me?
£200.
- You want money?
- Of course.
You're not a hooker, are you?
I don't mind what word you use.
Hang on a minute.
I thought we were, you know...
You thought what?
- I can't pay for sex.
- Why not?
Because I'm, you know...
I mean, you know, it's not...
I'm not a payer-for-sexer.
Well, you have to.
If you don't, they'll cut me.
Who will?
People I work for.
She's in.
- Where's she off to?
- Photograph of company directors.
She likes you.
I do believe we have her.
Let's begin stage two.
Well, what about that one?
Look at his shoes.
Handmade.
Probably Jermyn Street.
It'll take too long to bleed him dry.
Well, I think...
Oh, lovely.
What about that one?
Too pretty.
Pretty girls don't play poker.
I can't believe you said that.
There's your mark.
Bohemian chic, roll-ups, odd socks.
Thinks he's an existentialist.
Be like shooting a fish in a bowl.
I'll see you later then.
Great.
Just what we're looking for.
I've got the number for the managing agents.
- Have you?
- Yes.
I hate managing agents, Brian.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
But I've decided I like you.
I like you very much.
Most architecture students are only interested in building skyscrapers... and monuments to corporate greed.
Me, I'm about bringing great design to the underclass.
Absolutely.
Yeah, they're crying out for it.
- What are you studying?
- I'm sort of...
Psychology.
That's a bit bourgeois.
You might say that, but, you know, know your enemy.
Through a study of human psychology...
I want to invert, to subvert, the mind of the international capitalists.
Laugh away, but let me just give you an example of that.
Never been very good with cards.
I just...
It's the thing you got to clip...
Sorry, can't shuffle.
I'm gonna take five cards off the top here, which I haven't seen.
Fair enough.
But take them.
Just hold onto them.
Put them in your hand, yeah?
From my knowledge of you, I'm going to be able to tell... just from reading your face, which is the highest card... in that hand.
You ever been hypnotized?
Okay, just look at me.
Look at the cards, relax.
The first one is the highest.
Sometimes it takes a while.
Don't block me, all right?
Look at me.
The third card is the highest one.
What you got left?
It does work sometimes, but I'm in the first year.
You are pretty good with cards, aren't you?
Now, don't lie to me, I can tell.
No, you're good.
We should have a game of...
What's it called?
Poker.
Ready?
Right, I'm gonna put £20 down.
How many do you want?
I got £20.
- Time for me to get out.
- Check.
£20.
In.
I'll go for £10.
£20.
I'm out.
I'm out.
So what have you got?
Jack high.
Two pairs.
Must be beginner's luck.
Which also means that you owe me quite a lot of money.
You've cleaned me out, man.
So are you any good?
You know, like, being an architect?
The best in my year.
Look, I'll put my watch into the mix.
I don't want your watch.
I don't have anything else.
There must be something you have that I want... some skill that you possess that I don't.
Like what?
These are good, Danny.
He can't play cards, but he does draw a lovely building.
Michael.
Here we go.
Showtime.
I'd like to see Mr. Greene, please.
Do you have an appointment?
Just tell him Mrs. Winterborn is here to see him.
That's quite all right, Sharon.
Hello again.
Come this way.
I thought about you last night.
It was a good night, wasn't it?
Please have a seat.
I'd like to see your site.
- What for?
- Professional interest.
You know it's fully invested?
I'd still like to see your site.
Okay.
That would be the main accommodation block there.
Restaurant.
Pool.
- Outdoor or indoor?
- One outdoor, one indoor... both flanked by the treatment rooms.
It's a beautiful place.
Good road and rail access.
Airport in half an hour.
- Planning permission?
- All sorted.
- Staff?
- Already started headhunting.
Hard to find good people.
Yeah, but not impossible.
Your ex-husband has loads.
I'd like to see your architect.
- But we've discussed this...
- Indulge me.
Call it professional interest.
This way.
I'm impressed you got planning permission.
- It wasn't easy.
- Bugger off!
You're trespassing!
Get off!
All I'd say is don't scrimp in the building and development.
It's easy to do, the costs spiral... and the marble effect looks nearly as good as real marble.
Don't do it.
And definitely don't cut costs in the bedrooms.
They should be better than guests have at home, not worse.
Furnishings.
It will be unrivaled, I give you my word.
And on opening day you can be my guest of honor.
I'd love to see his face when he finds out I'm involved with the competition.
- He will be furious.
- But, Katherine, with all due respect... you're not involved with the competition.
I'm going to invest £100,000 in your business.
You can't do that.
No one knows more about this than me.
Let me invest £100,000 and I'll be your consultant for free.
- Are you sure it's what you want?
- Positive.
I'll bring the papers over tomorrow.
- Two glasses of champagne, please.
- Okay.
Okay, furnishings.
Good.
Would you put that straight in the van?
Brian, thank you so much.
You're a star.
Thank you for that.
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.
What made you change your mind?
For months now, the first image in my head when I wake... is of him and his little girlfriend, smiling and laughing... enjoying the lifestyle I've created.
I hate him.
I want to hurt him.
Katherine, all you have to do...
But that's no way to live the rest of my life.
Eaten away with anger and bitterness.
That way he wins again.
It would have been fun to work with you, I'm sure of that... but it would have been wrong for me.
I need a fresh start and this isn't it.
I'm sorry.
- I can't persuade you?
- I know you won't even try.
I hope it works out for you.
Thank you.
I owe you a lot.
About the dog, it was hit by a car... and was in great distress.
The vet said it should be put down, and I made that decision.
So you let her walk away?
I gave her an out, like always.
This time she took it.
How hard did you try and persuade her?
That's the point.
A lot of work has gone into this, Michael.
People have expectations.
The great Mickey Bricks, falling for a mark.
It's a question of ethics.
- Ethics?
What bloody ethics?
- Calm down.
- We're con men, for Christ's sake!
- We do not cheat honest people.
What about June?
We'll think of something.
We always do.
- Fancy a Slow Comfortable Screw, Ash?
- No, thanks, Eddie.
Hello?
Sorry to phone you so late, Mrs. Winterborn.
But I'm afraid that the midwife won't be able to get out to you in the morning.
- What midwife?
- The district midwife.
I think you must have the wrong number.
Mrs. Stephen Winterborn.
Date of birth:
September 13, 1983.
Your husband brought you in yesterday, according to our records.
Mr. Winterborn no longer resides at this address.
Never call this number again.
What made you change your mind?
When I was 23, I got pregnant.
It was a complete accident, unplanned.
But when I found out, I was so happy.
I told Stephen and he just said:
"But we're not going to have children.
We agreed. "
And he was right.
We agreed the business would come first.
But I couldn't help feeling elated.
What happened?
We talked about it.
He decided...
He bullied me until I had an abortion.
And that was that for me.
I'm sorry.
Now I hear he's got his little tart pregnant.
I'll give you £100,000 worth of investment... and you give me free rein over the spa.
I'll make it sparkle.
How did you find out she was pregnant?
I got a call by mistake from the hospital.
What time was this?
Late last night.
Don't go.
I have to.
I haven't signed the contract.
And you're not going to.
What do you mean, Patrick?
It's just not the right thing for you to do.
I don't understand.
Trust me on this.
When am I going to see you again?
Katherine, you're never going to see me again.
Why?
That's just the way it has to be.
I'm sorry.
You're done with me, are you?
Stupid, bitter woman, good for a shag and a few quid?
There is no hotel, Katherine.
No spa, no investors.
My name is not Patrick.
Some associates and myself picked you out as a potential victim.
You were rich, bitter, angry, obsessed.
You were ripe to be plucked.
You're a con man.
But I will not let you be our mark.
I won't be a part of it.
Wait.
You were setting me up.
I was.
You con people for money, that's what you're saying?
You're all the same, all of you.
£200,000.
- I'll give you £200,000.
- There is no spa.
Who said anything about a spa?
I want you to destroy my ex-husband.
A rat to catch a rat.
- Don't do this.
- £250,000.
What's your price, scumbag?
I want to see him humiliated.
No, it's not what we do.
It's one thing conning a nasty piece of work.
She is a nasty piece of work.
It's quite another destroying a man's life for a fee.
What's this bloke like she wants to destroy?
- He's all right.
A bit full of himself, but...
- No, he's not pleasant, actually.
Forced her to have an abortion... ran off with a younger model, and promptly got her pregnant.
- You haven't even met him.
- I know his type.
Then why are we talking about it?
If he's that bad, he doesn't sound any different from any other con.
And there's June to think about.
No, she wouldn't want us to do anything just because of her.
I would, though.
Okay, then we have to move fast.
He's floating his business in two days.
- That's when we get him.
- What's the in?
I have no idea.
He's a very careful man, by all accounts.
- Women?
- He's had two in his whole life.
Revenge.
If we let him know his wife is setting him up for a fall... we might hook him in that way.
- I don't want her involved.
- Bloody hell, Mickey.
There must be something.
A hole in his wall.
We don't have very long to find it.
You wanna keep your voice down?
The great Danny Blue paid for it with a Russian hooker.
- How much was it, Danny?
- Can you please just shut up?
Is it enough?
A prostitution racket being run from his hotel spa?
Lt'll crucify him.
- So what do we do now?
- We need proof.
No.
No way.
Come on, you did it once.
What's the difference?
I didn't know she was a hooker then, did I?
I've got a reputation to think of.
Every silver cane has a grubby end, Danny.
- And when needs must...
- You grab the grubby end, Danny boy.
- No.
- Danny, we need you.
If you can't get something concrete from this woman... this whole thing falls down.
All right.
But, I mean it, listen, no one is to know anything about this.
Cheers, Danny.
Eddie, Danny pays for sex.
Taxi!
Hello!
Stephen Winterborn.
We met at one of my spas.
Oh, yeah.
Hi.
Of course.
The man who hates mineral-water ice cubes.
- Which way are you heading?
- Back to the city.
Me, too.
Shall we share the cab?
Yeah, okay.
You never told me what you did in the city.
- You never asked.
- I did, actually.
I monitor new flotations.
Advise my board whether they should invest in them or not.
What would you advise your board about me?
I don't know, really.
I normally follow much bigger flotations than yours.
- No offense.
- None taken.
So where are you having the launch?
Went to a lovely one at the Docklands.
At the spa.
- Nice.
- You think I should have done more?
The most important thing is the presentation.
I got my usual PR firm to knock something up.
"Knock something up"?
Stephen, this is the most important moment of your business life.
I've got a friend I think you should meet.
They're early.
The man is nothing short of astonishing.
Cindy, what on earth are you doing here?
I want you to meet my friend.
I've heard great things about you, Mr. Cavendish.
I'm working.
Sorry.
He's a brilliant PR, but very rude.
I want you to have a look at Stephen's presentation.
Now why would I want to do that?
Because I'm asking you nicely.
...experience, which pampers and relaxes... while at the same time, refreshes and energizes.
Each of our spas offers a unique experience.
But the one thing they have in common is indulgence.
Winterborns Hotel and Spas.
- What do you think?
- Very nice.
Reminds me of those ads you have in provincial cinemas.
"The Taj Mahal Indian Restaurant, just moments from this cinema. "
Mr. Cavendish, can't you just fizz it up a bit?
No, I don't do fizz.
Come on, Mr. Cavendish.
I'll make it worth your while.
So, what's up?
Open it.
So how many of the other girls are turning tricks?
Only the Russian ones, and the Lithuanians.
And the Ukrainian girl.
What would the management do if they found out?
They're the ones who organized it.
You sure about that?
The Mafia guy in Moscow told me there is a job opportunity in England...
- and I jumped at it.
- The Mafia?
So the management of the hotel are making a lot of money out of you girls.
We have to service at least three clients a week.
Service?
- Nervous?
- A bit.
Don't be.
It's all under control.
And I hear it's a big year for you.
You and Charlotte.
The pitter-patter of tiny feet.
- Who told you that?
- I heard it on the grapevine.
It's highly unlikely.
I've never been able to have children.
Excuse me.
For God's sake, be more bloody careful.
Lovely night for an execution.
- No doubts?
- He's a bastard.
This is how you deal with bastards.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Thank you all for coming.
Tonight is the proudest night of my life... to be surrounded by friends, honored guests, and the woman I love.
It's taken a lot of people a lot of work to get where we are tonight.
I want to thank them all from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you very much, everybody.
But tonight is just a start, the first step on a magnificent journey.
And now a short presentation.
Enjoy.
Winterborns Hotel and Spas, a retreat away from daily life.
- Something doesn't smell right.
- What is it?
Stephen said that he can't have children.
- No, he told her to have an abortion.
- I know.
Somebody's lying.
Who?
Yeah, speaking.
Wait, I can't hear you.
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
Bloke from the office says he found the earring you lost.
- But I haven't lost an earring.
- She hasn't lost an earring.
Which one?
It's not the nice lady.
It's the nasty lady.
Okay, thank you.
She went back to find the earring.
I was here earlier.
Well, at least I think I was.
I dropped an earring.
- There's nobody here.
- Where is everyone?
They were only here for a day.
Nice people, though.
She's known who we are all along.
This is how you deal with bastards.
Our beauty therapists are specially trained.
From all corners of the former Soviet Union, they come to work... to work as prostitutes.
The Mafia guy in Moscow told me there was a job opportunity in England... and I jumped at it.
They cannot speak out without fear of violence and punishment.
Winterborns, where exploitation...
- Ash, stop it.
- It's too late.
I can't.
We're destroying an innocent man.
For Christ's sake, will you stop the presentation?
I don't know anything about that.
I'll try and explain this as well as I can.
Watch the suit.
None of this is true.
I know nothing about this.
Excuse me.
How could you do this to me?
Why?
Lovely night for an execution.
I owe you all an apology.
I let my guard down, and I got caught.
And the con man got conned.
Never let a mark get under your skin.
I know, and I'm sorry.
I promise you all it will never happen again.
Anyway, what about the £250,000?
It's in our account, every penny.
- Have you told June?
- Yeah.
- Mickey, I just want to...
- No, Ash.
She's family.
I spoke to my friendly DI in Vice... told her Stephen Winterborn knew nothing about the prostitution racket.
So at least he won't be charged.
Thanks, Stacie.
But they'll charge Mickey's woman for running a brothel out of the spa.
Yeah, if they can find her.
She's emptied her accounts and left the country.
What a woman.
She really had you fooled, didn't she?
- Okay, I made an error of judgment.
- Yes, you did.
"Say what you will, 'tis better to be left
"Than never to have loved"
William Congreve, playwright.
Oh, no.
- What is this, Eddie?
- The Congreve.
It's made with a lot of bitters.
Get it?
Bitters.
Bitter women.
I'd like to propose a toast.
- To living and learning.
- To falling in love with marks.
At least he didn't have to pay, Danny.
What's the toast, Ash?
To family.
That's disgusting.
E. R.
Previously on E. R.
- My parents were in a car accident.
- I'm sorry.
Happened in some province north of Suzhou.
I'm pregnant.
- You did it.
- We have a baby.
It's nice to finally meet you, Dr. Corday.
I look forward to working together again... soon.
Excuse me, can someone get the door, please?
Get me the hell out of here!
- Nice place.
- Yeah, it's okay.
E. R. 10x15 "BLOOD RELATIONS"
Oh, God.
Nolan.
Nolan, wake up.
It's happening.
It's freezing.
Did you turn the heat down?
Nolan, get up.
Rise and shine.
The baby's coming.
We'll drop you at Gram's on the way.
Hello.
Earth to children.
You need to get dressed now.
Clay.
Come on, get up, honey.
Clay?
Clay?
Clay?
Clay?
Clay?
Oh, my God!
My God.
Shannon?
Shannon?
Shannon?
Shannon?
Nolan!
Nolan?
Nolan?
Nolan!
Nolan, wake up!
Nolan?
Nolan?
Nolan?
The alarm didn't go off.
- What?
- It's time for you to leave.
- What time is it?
- Get your butt out of bed!
Hey!
He might be up.
I didn't hear the TV.
That's probably why you should get going.
- Can I at least get a shower?
- No.
I think I found a roach.
No, just an old raising.
- Why are you up?
- Why are you?
I'm going to that stupid aquarium thing with Oscar.
The imagination you provide...
- Alex.
- When are we gonna get a satellite?
We should probably talk.
They have, like, 1000 channels or something.
Hello.
I took out T-bones for dinner.
- Okay.
I'll bring the ketchup.
- Over my dead body.
- What time should I pick you up?
- That's okay.
I can take the El.
It's icy out.
I wouldn't want the little Martin kid getting hurt.
Don't do that.
What?
Make assumptions about last names.
Little Petey, then?
Little Jenny?
Until my name changes, if it ever does, he or she is a Lewis.
- Whatever you say, Mommy.
- Don't do that either.
- Okay, I gotta go.
Bye.
- Okay, bye.
Oh, hey.
When are you gonna introduce me to your old man?
He knows about me, right?
Did you tell him about the baby?
- Not yet.
- Don't you think you ought to-?
- I gotta go.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Morning.
Am I late or are you early?
No point staying in bed if you can't sleep.
Tell me about it.
Chuck snores.
Either I need earplugs or-
- Separate bedrooms.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
So is this gonna be a rush, or depress the hell out of me?
The latter.
It's multiples all from the same address.
Vicki Bennett, 38 weeks pregnant, in active labor and fully dilated.
Why is this happening?
I'd say your baby was ready.
Breathe through the contractions.
Set up a fetal monitor.
So Mom's in labor.
What's wrong with everyone else?
Unknown.
The family was found unconscious.
- Was the heat on?
- It's 10 degrees.
- What's the story?
- Possible CO poisoning.
- More family members coming in.
- Need some help here!
- How long has he been seizing?
- Since we pulled up.
Altered mental status prior, no signs of head trauma.
- He on anticonvulsants?
- Not according to his wife.
Eight- and 10-year-old...
- ... are behind, out cold at the scene.
- What is it?
Looks like relative hypoxia.
I got this one.
Take the kids.
Clay Bennett, altered, but coming around.
Nausea.
- Vital signs normal.
- Feel sick, dude?
- This one nauseous too?
- Complains of headache.
Good vitals.
You take the boy, I'll deal with the girl.
What?
Hi, my name's Abby.
We're gonna try to make you feel better, okay?
- She's crowning.
- Where's my family?
- They're being taken care of.
- Fetal heart rate's at 105.
- I don't understand what happened.
- We're not sure but you need to stay here.
Okay, let's get Mom on 100 percent 02 by mask.
- Labs?
- No one would wake up.
Neela, labs now.
CBC, type and Rh, UA and ABG with carboxyhemoglobin level.
When a family passes out in winter, we assume it's carbon-monoxide poisoning.
Happens if your heater doesn't vent properly.
But I didn't pass out.
Fetal hemoglobin has a higher CO affinity.
- What?
- In English.
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize, just explain.
The baby's blood took the carbon monoxide.
That cleared it from your body and kept you well.
Does that-?
Does that mean the baby got it all?
Okay, big push for the next one, Vicki.
Oh, my God!
Here we go.
Stand by with a pediatric intubation tray.
- Enough.
- We need to get him on a non-rebreather and draw an ABG.
- Neonatal laryngoscope?
- Bottom right.
- That's six of Ativan.
- Push another two.
How's Mom?
Lucky she was pregnant.
- Pratt.
Morris needs you in here.
- I'm a little busy.
Let me rephrase that.
His patient needs you.
Go ahead.
I got this.
Hang Dilantin after eight of lorazepam.
All right.
Keep Dad's airway secure.
- What's the problem?
- He won't listen.
I want my mommy.
Yeah, hold on.
Girl with a headache.
Pulse ox, 100 percent on two liters.
- Do I have to draw a blood gas?
- You do.
- I told you.
- Her sats are normal.
Pulse ox measures oxygen dissolved in the blood not bound to hemoglobin.
- It's normal in CO poisoning.
- I told him that too.
Damn!
Who's the resident here?
- You okay?
- Is my family dying?
It sort of snuck up on us, you know?
I mean, I don't
- I don't think either one of us planned it.
- Right?
- Right.
It happens.
People date.
You okay back there?
Yeah.
- You want to talk about this?
- No.
- He'll break down muscle cells.
- Open up the fluids.
Come on, man.
- Enough is enough.
- Dilantin's in.
Any longer, we'll get irreversible brain damage.
- So, what do we do?
- A drip and hope it works.
- How fast should I run it in?
- Wait, wait.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Mr. Bennett, can you hear me?
Carboxyhemoglobin 35 percent.
He needs the hyperbaric chamber.
- Only if it's over 40.
- Or has neurologic impairment.
We don't know that yet.
Keep him on oxygen.
We'll give him 30 minutes.
If he doesn't wake up quick, then we'll talk hyperbarics.
Baby's distress probably induced labor.
- It's a good thing too.
- You can do it.
Otherwise they'd all be dead right about now.
- Fetal heart rate's down to 80.
- Why us?
Okay, you really gotta push hard with this next one.
Here we go.
Get ready with a receiving blanket.
What did we do?
Okay, head's out.
Bulb syringe.
One more push, Vicki.
Okay.
It's a boy.
Clamp.
We're good people.
We go to church.
Okay, hang in there, Vicki.
Neela, deliver the placenta.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
How is he?
- He's having a little trouble breathing.
- One for color, one for tone.
- Zero for respirations.
- Something's wrong.
What's wrong?
- Starting compressions.
- His heart isn't beating well...
- ... because it's been deprived of oxygen.
- And his brain?
Oh, God!
We need to intubate.
Point-three of epi and draw an ABG.
Let's see how much carbon monoxide he's taken in.
Bad enough when residents are late but when Attendings are late it sends a message that time is amorphous.
Seven a. m. is 7 a. m., people.
When Kovac's in, I wanna talk to him.
Yes, ma'am.
Stop surfing the web on County time.
- Oh, Dr. Weaver.
- Fair warning.
Henry's colicky, Sandy's pulling a 24 and I haven't had coffee.
What do you want?
- Placenta's out.
- Neela, 20 of Pit.
Why isn't he crying?
He has a tube to give him oxygen.
Good strong pulse and he's pinking up.
We'll find out how your family's doing.
Mom's carbon monoxide is in the safe range, 19 percent.
- How's our little hero?
- He's at 48.
- Coma range?
- Needs hyperbaric therapy.
- What's going on?
- Your son has a very high level of carbon monoxide we need to clear.
- Like scubadiving.
- He needs a pressure chamber.
- Equivalent to 66 feet of water to get three times more oxygen.
- Will he wake up then?
- We hope.
- Can I hold him?
- Yeah.
You can touch him.
But the sooner we start the treatment, the better the results.
- He's...
He's beautiful.
- Yeah, he is.
- Sorry, we gotta go.
- We'll do everything we can.
- Neela.
- My baby...
Take this.
You did a NICU rotation?
I need you in the chamber.
- You sending me?
- A nurse will be with you.
- They're waiting.
- I thought an Attending should-
- No.
A dive takes too long.
- How long?
A couple of hours.
Is that a problem?
- Okay.
- There you go.
Take off your gown.
Put on booties.
No lipstick, no makeup, hair spray, nail polish, perfume.
- What?
- All flammable.
Removing watches, jewelry, electronic equipment.
Any unfinished root canals, temporary fillings?
- No.
Why?
- Trapped air in the tooth socket.
It can expand.
Do you know how to clear your ears?
- I can't do this.
- Pinch your nostrils.
- Blow against your glottis.
- I can't go in.
- Are you claustrophobic?
- Is there time for a replacement?
What do you think?
Come on.
- All right, hook him up to the vent.
- I'll set the clock.
- Patient and attendant set?
- Go for it.
You're not gonna panic, are you?
Initiating pressurization.
- Does it stay this loud?
- You get used to it.
I'm sorry.
Can we stop now?
Ten feet.
Do we have a problem in there?
My ear's bothering me.
Take us up two feet.
Hold your nose.
Blow to equalize.
I'm sorry.
Please, can we stop now?
Resume pressurization.
You really should be on the postpartum floor.
Mommy!
It's all right.
Mommy's here now.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You're not helping by not taking care of yourself.
- How is he?
- He's a little groggy.
- You just had a baby.
- If I can't be with my baby I wanna be with them.
Vitals q. 30 minutes, CBC in two hours.
Mom's good and cranky.
How's Dad?
Just woke up.
Neuro exam's non-focal.
Oriented to person, place and time.
He could still have long-term neuro-psychological deficits.
- She know that yet?
- No.
She doesn't need to.
- The girl's headache subsided.
- Yeah.
How's the boy?
Hungry, wants a snack.
But he's worried about Mom and Dad.
- Yeah, me too.
Any word on the baby?
- In the chamber.
- What's his PO2?
- He has a name.
Samuel.
Can you make sure whoever's with him knows that?
Of course.
- What's the verdict?
- Four hours at 100 percent they should all be clear.
The baby's another story.
Yeah.
So how are you doing with your pregnancy?
Oh, fine.
You know, tired.
A little scared.
- About having one?
- About what happens after you do.
- Every winter it's the same thing.
- Is there any sort of air conditioning?
Temperatures go down, heaters get turned up, people asphyxiate.
Why does it have to be so hot in here?
When pressure rises in a fixed volume, it's gonna get warm.
Ideal gas law.
PV = nRT.
What about it?
Okay.
Time to give the kid an air break.
- Prevents oxygen toxicity.
- I can hardly breathe.
- Too much and he could seize.
- How much longer?
- Hour 40.
- Neela.
- Yeah?
- His name's Samuel.
- Sorry?
- The baby.
The mom wanted you to know.
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
Okay, good.
I'll see you in a couple hours.
Kerry, I examined Mrs. Krall and she won't require surgery.
She passed her kidney stone half an hour ago.
- She wants to turn it into a brooch.
- I'm sorry.
What?
Okay, let me guess.
Henry has colic and you're barely sleeping.
Yeah.
Did Ella have it too?
And terrible teething.
It's no cakewalk now.
Tantrums, a constant demand for toys, refusing to eat.
I hate to say it, but in some ways, it gets harder.
It must be twice as hard by yourself.
You have any prospects?
I met a teacher recently.
He's a nice man.
Nice is good.
Yes, it's nice.
Okay, open up.
All right, there you go.
- Oh, with a minute to spare.
- That's me.
Punctual.
Her dad says she has strep.
Later.
It's been going around her school.
Okay, let's see.
Oh, 101. 7.
You have a fever, young lady.
Anything else?
Stuffy nose?
- No.
It's just my throat.
- Okay, let's have a look.
Oh, looks pretty red.
Doctor's gonna want to take a culture.
How long's that gonna take?
Waiting room's pretty packed.
Six to eight hours.
- I just started a new job.
- It'll be okay, Daddy.
Why don't you two take a seat, and we'll call you as soon as we can.
- Do you think Alex is okay?
- I don't know.
Maybe you should bring him to my place tonight.
We can talk, watch something on the big screen.
- I'm not sure.
- I'll cook.
Is this where I sign in?
Can we talk about this later?
I need to get back to work.
- How can I help you today, ma'am?
- Kovac.
- Morning, Kerry.
- I should be grateful it's not afternoon.
You're late, which makes me late for a meeting.
Look for the deduction in your paycheck.
Could be worse.
She could have an M16 strapped on.
What's this?
Place across the street does dry-ice shipments.
It's a prenatal-care package for Kem.
Plus some stuff they need at the clinic.
SusPhrine, terbutaline.
Yeah, I hear they're really desperate for roses in the Congo.
- How long has it been?
- Since we've seen each other?
Thirty-four days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.
But we e-mail each other.
She says she's really starting to show.
All right, see you later.
Would you hand me a tissue?
He really misses her.
Married for 36 years.
He gave my mom flowers every anniversary.
- Swore he loved her till the day she died.
- Sounds sweet.
- Of course, he loved his girlfriends too.
- Just had you and your sister?
Yeah.
Both raised by crazy people.
Couldn't have turned out different.
They did their best.
That's the scary part.
Twenty-something John Doe found down behind a building.
Just like all weaklings!
Where is all this blood coming from?
GSW?
Knife wound?
He wouldn't exactly let us check.
Fistfight maybe?
- The other guy won.
- Just let me go, please!
Altered and agitated.
Tachycardic at 128.
BP, 160/92.
Gotta be on something heavy-duty.
I hate your guts!
Sixty-six-year-old male, acute shortness of breath, febrile, sats 94 percent.
I'm on my way out.
Sorry.
Bed-bound, secondary to pelvic fracture.
Deb?
- Hey, Carter.
- How are you?
When did you get back?
Last week.
I couldn't leave China... until my father was stable.
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- She had a fatal PE.
And now my dad's got pneumonia.
I've been taking care of him at home.
With nursing care?
He doesn't want anyone in the house.
- It's been hard.
- Hey, Deb.
Deb, how are you?
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.
- Hey, Dr. C.
- Hey, Malik.
- Good to see you.
You all right?
- Yeah.
Hey, Dr. Chen.
Sorry.
What's the problem again?
My grandson is coughing too much.
I need to see Dr. Weaver.
She's not in.
My daughter said to have her check him.
Ma'am, he'll be seen by a doctor, but I can't guarantee which one.
Sandy and Dr. Weaver, they live together.
It's evil.
You hear me?
Found a meth pipe.
Wanna guess what the tox screen's gonna say?
Do a full workup.
He could just as easily be that way from a head bleed.
- It's everywhere.
It's everywhere!
- You want hard restraints?
Try Ativan first.
No free fluid, Morrison's is clear.
- No signs of trauma.
- Where's the wound?
- What?
- I can't find anything.
Like, nothing, not a scratch.
It's demons!
There's demons all around us!
Hematocrit's normal.
So he's not bleeding internally or externally.
- Hope he works in a meatpacking plant.
- Dr. Lewis.
You got a minute?
Yeah.
You know what?
Call the cops in case he doesn't.
What's up?
Nancy Natarelli, 42, with nausea vomiting and fatigue times two weeks.
She's afebrile, normal vitals, lungs clear, abdomen soft.
No CVA tenderness.
Her meds include kali phos and arsenicum.
Homeopathic stuff.
Oh, I got five kids at home.
I can't be sick like this.
That's a lot of diapers.
Who are you telling?
I had three of my own already.
These five are theirs.
You're pretty young to be a grandma.
You think it's the side effects from the St. John's Wort?
It's probably just a stomach virus.
We'll run some tests to make sure.
Why are you taking it?
Are you depressed?
Just thought I'd be done raising kids by now.
Okay.
We'll be back.
What?
CBC, chem panel, UA?
Could be pyelo.
Yeah.
Run a psych history and make sure she's not clinically depressed.
- Dad's coming around.
- Okay.
- He's okay.
- All right, Vicki.
You need to stay in bed and put your mask on.
- He's talking and everything.
- That goes for you too.
- How are you feeling, Mr. Bennett?
- Headache.
- What happened?
- Do you know what today is?
Wednesday.
Vicki said that the baby saved our lives.
Yeah.
He did.
Is he gonna be okay?
Staring won't make it go faster.
- Why are these chambers so small?
- I've been in smaller.
We're over halfway there, okay?
Relax.
Don't.
You have no idea how hard this is for me.
- You want some Valium?
- What?
- To calm your nerves?
- No, I just
- I need to get out of here.
- Wait a minute.
- He's stable now.
- But-
- If I don't get out, I'll lose it!
- Do you understand?
- Problem?
- I'm stepping in the airlock.
Bring me up.
- Are we okay with this?
Yeah.
Get Dr. Olivera to take her place.
Lucky for you it's easier going up than going down.
Hurry, please.
Ascending.
Tachycardia.
Heart rate's 180.
- Is the other doctor en route?
- Yeah.
I paged him.
Breath sounds decreased on the left.
P waves, not SVT.
He's got a pneumothorax.
Forty feet.
Do you need a surgeon in there?
- No.
We need to re-inflate his lung.
- Pulse is weak and thready.
- Bring me back down.
- Descending.
Open the crash cart and prep the chest.
- PVCs.
Are you coming back in?
- Just until the other doctor arrives.
Sixty feet.
Sixty feet.
My ear!
I'm bleeding!
You perfed your eardrum.
Don't worry.
It grows back.
Come on.
We 're at depth.
Subtle right-middle lobe infiltrate.
Sure makes me appreciate our healthcare system.
I had to wait a week for a chest film in Zuzhou.
Low-grade fever.
It's probably just early pneumonia.
Or pulmonary embolus.
Can he get a V/Q scan?
Doesn't need one.
D-dimer's negative.
He's low probability for PE.
Does he walk at all?
He can, but he won't.
And I can't make him.
Since his surgery, he's been depressed, a bit demented.
Just stares at the TV.
So, what happened?
They skidded off some back road in the middle of nowhere.
Car flipped.
My mom never regained consciousness.
Jing-Mei?
I'll let you two get caught up.
Thank you, John.
What's going on?
I'm having my dad checked for PE.
When did you get back?
Last Monday.
You should have called.
How are you, Mr. Chen?
The ET tube's down too far.
No, it's a tension pneumo.
Give me a 22-gauge.
Are you all right in there?
- Alcohol wipe.
- Sure you're up for this?
- Where the hell is Dr. Olivera?
- Coming in.
Finally.
There.
How's the heart rate?
Back down to 128.
He needs a chest tube.
You start.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Five centimeters of water on the Thora-Seal.
You'll be at depth in a minute.
Perfect.
Sleeping like a baby now.
No sense in keeping him in here.
Pupils are 4 millimeters, equal and reactive.
- And he has beautiful irises.
- Can you move him to Sutures?
- Sure thing.
- Just wait till he comes to and realizes we took his crystal meth pipe.
Won't be so cute then.
You have a standing order for five of Haldol.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
Will he be able to tell us what happened?
I doubt he'll remember.
- It's sad.
- What?
He's somebody's kid.
Morris, I got a call that my son was here?
Yeah.
He's in Curtain 1.
He's really cute.
Florina?
- He just wouldn't stop coughing.
- Hi, baby.
- Handsome boy, Kerry.
- Thanks.
I see he's eating okay.
But he was very uncomfortable.
His ears are fine.
Lungs are clear.
Belly's soft.
It's probably just a cold.
Come here, baby.
I appreciate you keeping them company.
Right.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
He was a very helpful man.
Grandma needs to get you home.
There are too many germs in this place.
Just keep the humidifier on and give him Tylenol if he gets fussy.
But what you really need is some sleep, sweetie.
Yes.
Will you be home late again tonight?
Probably not.
- He yours, Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.
All 16 pounds of him.
- How sweet.
- That's my...
That's my guy.
Severa, how much morphine did you give Dolly Zuzich?
Twelve milligrams.
- Have you seen that little girl's father?
- She's not with them?
- No.
Came in with her dad.
- Haven't seen her with anyone else.
- Christy, where's your dad?
- He's coming right back.
- When?
- After work.
- He just leave you here?
- I'm okay.
Come on.
Let's get you inside.
Fifteen blade, fifth intercostal.
- I hate doing procedures on infants.
- Getting more tachycardic.
Twenty seconds.
- Kelly.
- Stay superior to rib.
What?
You'll have to speak up.
Into the pleura.
Keep your pinkie in the tract so you don't lose it.
- Inserting tube.
- Trachea's midline.
Can't thread it in.
I can't see.
Wipe my brow.
Wipe my brow!
- We 're equalized.
- I'm here.
I'm in. 3-0 silk.
Heart rate's down to 110.
Hi, Dad.
It's me.
I put that Foley in Babe Grunhard.
You owe me.
Oh, yeah.
Could you give 40 of prednisone to Peenie Sudar in 2?
No, me, Susan, your daughter.
What's up?
Well, you know, not much.
I was just calling to check in.
- Tell him.
- Excuse me, doctor.
Dad, you know what?
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Bye.
You should be in bed.
We wanna know about the baby.
I will go check right now.
- Come back inside with me.
- Hey, Dr. Lewis.
- Yes?
- Natarelli's test results.
- Oh, young grandma?
- Yep.
Now I know why she was more tired than usual.
Positive ICON.
You want me to tell her?
There she is.
I'll do it.
Do me a favor, call the chamber and find out how the baby is.
Yeah.
Nancy?
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Is something wrong?
- Well, that depends.
You're pregnant.
No, I can't be.
I'm on the pill.
Unfortunately, St. John's Wort can make oral contraceptives ineffective.
Oh, my God!
I'm pregnant?
!
Coming through!
Yeah.
You know, I'm sorry.
Dr. Gallant can answer any questions you have.
- I'll be back, okay?
- Clara Waskowitz, fifties.
Stab wounds to neck, chest, abdomen.
Blood loss?
Scene was covered in it.
BP's 78 over, palp.
- It was the drugs.
- Her lung's down.
- What's open?
- Nothing.
Housekeeping's backed up.
- Husband's in the next rig.
- It wasn't his fault.
Multiple wounds.
As many as the wife.
Hard to tell who's worse.
Whoever did this must have been really pissed off.
- Is it broken?
- Yep.
That's what happens when you hit someone with your fist.
Spare some change?
- Get a job, dude.
- What do you think you're doing?
How about you, sweets?
Feed the poor.
Leave her alone and get back to your bed, okay?
I'm not talking to you.
I am talking to-
Get back to your bed, damn it!
- He spit on me!
- You're okay.
You're okay, honey.
We'll get you something else to wear.
Let's put on a gown.
Where are her parents?
Dad left her in Triage.
I brought her here, thought she'd be safer.
Okay.
Let's do one better.
Find her a room.
Good deal.
Hey, I never got an answer.
- About?
- You know, some pasta, wine...
- ... a little Xbox for Alex.
- I don't think tonight will work.
Tomorrow night then?
Actually, I was thinking it might be a good time to take a break.
- What?
- You know, just take it slower.
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
We're not exclusive, right?
We're just, like, dating or whatever.
No commitments, no strings, no co-parenting.
Just keep it casual, okay?
Okay.
Sam!
Dr. Kovac!
Double trauma.
We need more hands.
She's out.
Come on, Clara.
Open your eyes.
- I can't find a line.
- I'll do it.
- Forget the drugs.
Let's tube her.
- BP's dropping, 54 systolic.
Suction on high.
Need another set of hands for this neck bleeder.
Bradying down.
Fifty three.
Three went to the right side alone.
Haven't seen this much blood since this morning.
More crichoid.
Think that speed freak did this?
Who knows?
30 French and curved Kelly.
Can you see the cords?
Throat was slashed but not the trachea.
I'm in.
Me too.
Mg of atropine.
The left lung is up.
- He was pretty bloody.
- Who?
Meth-pipe boy.
And he was hallucinating.
Laceration to the left axilla.
- V-fib.
- Paddles.
Charge to 200.
Stabbing victim, right?
Is she a surgical candidate?
Not a very good one.
Clear.
- Still V-fib.
- Her husband's next door.
Try him.
- Charge to 300.
- Clear.
Ten stab wounds, mainly abdominal.
Still hypotensive, 64/48.
Hang another two on the rapid infuser.
- Home invasion?
Robbery gone bad?
- Gotta be more personal than that.
Where are you?
- Free belly fluid with hypotension.
- Urine negative for heme.
- Cops said their house was broken into.
- They could know who did it.
Good breath sounds.
Red line for an open laparotomy.
Hang two grams of cefotetan.
How come there's only men in here?
- Ectopy.
- Probably ischemia from the hypotension.
- Let's do a subclavian.
- And keep the blood pouring in.
Clear.
- Asystole.
It's been 40 minutes.
- And eight units of O-neg.
I guess that's it, Clara.
Time of death: 10:54.
Hope this wasn't evidence.
Look.
I guess it was related.
- Settle down.
- No!
Let me go!
Let go!
Look, I didn't even do anything!
I didn't know them!
Let me go!
Let me go!
- Hey.
So, what's the story?
- Kid went nuts, stabbed his parents.
Killed one of them, right?
Starting to ascend.
- Thank God.
- You did great.
- More like Samuel survived despite me.
- No, seriously.
You did great.
- You okay?
- I'm feeling a little funny.
- Are you having chest pain?
- A bit.
- Abort ascent.
- What?
No.
- There's crepitus and sub-Q emphysema.
- Probably blew out a few air sacs.
Oh, no.
Rapid ascent could collapse a lung.
We better do an hour-long decompression.
Another hour?
- How long will he be under?
- Four hours.
Make the next units type-specific.
We need to get his statement.
This man's been stabbed 11 times.
Let him survive surgery first.
- Hello.
- Hello.
So, what brings you to the ER?
Transcatheter embolization of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
That's quite a mouthful.
- And you?
- Stabbing victim.
Lacerated liver and spleen, open laparotomy thoracoscopy and pericardiectomy.
Push the executive session to next week.
And tell Anspaugh to contact me before scheduling meetings I'm expected to attend.
Do you think you'd like to go out sometime?
Sure.
Good.
- I'll call.
- Yeah, you do that.
I thought you were dating a teacher.
I am.
Prostate cancer with back pain and leg weakness... cannot wait a day for an MRI.
- Sign here and here.
- You know, we're short-staffed too.
Dr. Lewis, we got Chuck on line one.
You know what?
I'll call him back.
You have five minutes to hire someone because I'm sending this guy up.
- Rough day?
- Just typical.
Mom's staring at the clock.
About the baby?
- Oh, crap!
How long ago was it?
- Two hours.
Just tell them I'm pregnant and maybe they'll cut me some slack.
And I'll have someone bring Mom down to the chamber.
Yeah, I'll get a wheelchair and take her myself.
Are you almost done?
I need to check labs.
Can you use one of the other terminals?
- What are you doing over here?
- None of your beeswax.
Dinovo's asking for a new albuterol prescription.
Labs are back on our orphan.
Positive for strep.
We can't treat her without parental consent.
What's wrong?
I'm okay.
You seem kind of...
Don't read into things.
Excuse me.
Hey, Mr. Grover, you're back.
Where's my daughter?
- Isn't it your job to know?
- Sorry?
- Dr. Kovac examined Christy.
- She has strep throat.
But worse, she's been traumatized by being left alone here.
- What happened?
Is she okay?
- She's fine.
No, she's not.
There are drunks here.
Junkies.
Psych patients.
Yeah, and doctors and security guards and nurses.
She's 10.
She could have wandered away, been abducted, assaulted.
- Luka?
- What?
He abandoned her.
I'm a single dad, okay?
I gotta feed my kid, so I gotta work.
What can I do when it takes six hours to see a doctor?
- Daddy!
- Honey!
Are you okay?
Did anybody bother you?
Give her 250 of pen VK.
He responded well to the therapy.
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.
It looks worse than it is.
- Are they ready yet?
- Yeah.
They just came out.
- Hey.
Is this Mom?
- Yeah.
Can she see him?
Yeah.
He can see her.
He opened his eyes a few minutes ago.
Hi, Samuel.
- It's Mommy.
- Spontaneous movement.
He'll need another round of treatment tomorrow but he looks good.
When can he go home?
Three days.
He'll need to be in the NICU overnight for observation and you'll be in OB.
We didn't plan on having a third.
Thank God he came along.
Neela, what are you still doing in there?
Possible pneumomediastinum, among other things.
You should've had someone replace you.
- Hi.
Thanks, Gina.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Bye.
- Bye.
How was the aquarium?
See any sharks?
Yep.
Maybe you and me could just hang out by ourselves tonight.
We haven't really had a chance to talk about things.
Like you and Luka having sex?
Well, that wasn't how I was gonna put it.
But, yeah, that.
What's there to talk about?
I don't know, how you feel.
Whether or not it hurts your feelings or pisses you off or whatever.
I'm fine.
- How's the baby?
- Great.
How's the rest of the family?
Just finishing dispo orders on Dad and the other kids now.
Oh, man.
What a hell of a day.
It's not even lunch yet.
You only got half a shift to go.
- When did you become so optimistic?
- Recently.
Dr. Carter, come have a look.
- Kem?
- John, is that you?
Oh, my
- Yeah!
Oh, my God!
How did you do this?
I found out the consulate had a web cam.
You look great.
How are you?
- She can hear me?
- Yeah.
See for yourself.
What do you think?
How come some women have little volleyball tummies when they're pregnant?
- Wow.
- And others don't?
- I felt a kick yesterday.
- Really?
High-speed MV A with multiple fractures.
Oh, I got it.
What do you think?
I think you're both beautiful.
You get the V/Q results?
Normal.
Negative Dopplers on the legs.
So no PE.
That's good.
Well, he still needs to be admitted for pneumonia, get him on IV antibiotics.
You knew that was gonna happen.
It's common at his age.
At least you're amongst friends here.
So how long you gonna do this?
Take care of him 24/7?
You know there are assisted-living situations-
My father's going to get better.
Jing-Mei...
I was at the hotel, asleep, when my mother died.
She was all alone.
Breathe.
- Your breath sounds are equal.
- I'm fine.
But once we're out, you'll need a chest x-ray.
- How much longer?
- Three feet and rising.
Come on.
Come on.
If it is pneumomediastinum, it'll resolve on its own.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Out of the way, please!
- Hey.
- Excuse me.
- Watch yourself!
- What the hell?
- Regular here?
- Yeah.
Every Tuesday with his buddies.
- Black Hawks fan?
- Maple Leafs.
Don't ask.
Hi, Dad.
I thought you said 6.
Ordered you a beer.
- There's someone I'd like you to meet.
- He's nuts!
That was not a crosscheck!
- on the play.
Lugay now in the box.
Shooting down across...
- What?
- Chuck Martin.
Pleased to meet you, sir.
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.
You two had dinner yet?
I'm gonna have a baby and Chuck's the father.
You're gonna be a grandpa.
They couldn't score a goal to save their lives.
- You marrying her?
- If she'll have me.
About damn time.

Where are your manners?
Were you like this to your mom, too?

Listen carefully I'm your mother, got it?
As much as you hate it
I'm the only one in this world you can call mother, got it?
Crying over your mom's photos won't change anything
Hard to handle, huh?
That's too bad
But that's how the world is
The world isn't as sweet as you picture it
Sometimes you have to bear the worst and live on
Like the way I'm bearing you two!
Tough isn't it?
I have beared you two brats from the moment I came to this house
I have never met such ill-mannered menaces like you two
What?
Why the hell did you even come here?
I can't believe you said that to me again
I see, you still must be sick
Don't touch me
- Let go!
- What's wrong with you?
Are you that clueless?
Don't touch me with those filthy hands!
Su-mi, listen to me
I don't want to hear it You're the same
That's not true you've misunderstood
You're not even accepting all this
Why is it always me?
Why are you asking only me to understand?
Are you really clueless?
Yeah,
Maybe I don't know I don't have all the answers
I don't know, so tell me and let it off your chest
Tell me!
Will it change anything?
Will it?
Su-mi

You'll get sick again
What?
Fine
From now on anything that happens here all the filthy things you brought here
be responsible for it all
I have nothing more to say so answer the phone
Do you remember?
My memory's a bit blurry but I think it did happen
When was it?
Hey, remember this?
You jumped into the rive to catch some fish
Then you started to drown and everyone had a fit
There was another funny story
What was it?
Oh yeah, I remember
Remember that crazy guy?
The funny thing is is that he was always normal but whenever it rained he went nuts
While plowing the field he'd strip off his clothes when it rained and run out into the highway
The funniest time was when it rained off and on
So he'd put on and take off his clothes, again and again
Then he got sick of it and just went into his house
Everyone in the neighborhood laughed so much back then
But when...
But when he was little he saw him doing that once
He saw him doing that once and then he ran together with that crazy guy
Our mom saw that and she almost passed out
Do you remember?
You remember, right?
Say something
Don't you remember?
You remember, right?
No
I don't remember
What?
I said I don't remember
Why don't you remember?
Are you crazy?
Mi-hee!
Mi-hee!
Wait, hold on to her

You two need to learn a lesson!
Was it your sister?
So do you feel better looking at your dead mom's things?

So tell me what has she done?
She keeps harassing Su-yeon
What?
Didn't you hear me?

Remember when I said you'll regret it some day?
You...
Know what's really scary?
You want to forget something
Totally wipe it off of your mind
But you never can
It can't go away, you see
And...
And it follows you around like a ghost
Help me
Sure, I'll help you
Let's end it here
Su-mi!
Su-mi!
Su-mi!
Where's Su-mi?
Where?
Please stop it
I'm sick of it now
Take this you'll feel much better
Su-mi!
Don't you get it yet?
You're just having a hard time adjusting
You still must be sick
You promised not to bring up that closet
How could we both get our periods on the same date?
Su-yeon is dead!
No, I don't remember!
Su-mi, are you okay?
It's all over now
You'll feel better here
Get some rest
I'll come and visit often
Take care of yourself Bye
Su-mi, what's wrong?

Mom?
Mom?
Mom, mom!
Mom!
Mom, mom, mom!
Mom!
Didn't you hear something?
Why'd you come up here?
Dad's not here
What do you mean by that?
Now you're trying to act like mom
Do me a favor
Stay out of our lives
Can you get out of the way?
I have to go
You...
You might regret this moment
Keep that in mind!
What can be worse than standing here with you?
When you're here
I wanna be as far away from you as I can
Understand?
Su-mi!
Su-mi!
Help me...

A TALE OF TWO sisters
How was your day today?
How was it?
Well then, shall we talk?
First, tell me about yourself.
Who do you think you are?
Do you know who this is?
Don't know?
It's your family.
Want to see it again?
Fine then.
Can you tell me about that day?
What happened that day?
You should be able to remember it clearly.
It's OK.
From now on, tell me what happened.
Aren't you getting out?
Su-yeon.
Su-yeon!
It's so pretty.
Give me your hand.
The other one.
Why?
Su-mi!
Welcome home!
It's been such a long time.
You've changed so much, Su-yeon.
You look prettier.
But you two really disappointed me.
I waited all day for you two, cooking and cleaning the house, but why didn't you say hi first?
What did you do?
Were you at the wharf?
You should have changed first before you went outside.
Anyway, welcome back home.
Is something wrong?
I see you are better.
I'm so glad you feel better now.
You're taking after your mum.
You're feeling a lot better too, right?
Right, I bet you're both tired.
Get some rest and come down for dinner.
I'm preparing a special dinner.
But you have to give me some time.
There's a lot to prepare.
We just got back.
Things don't look so good right now.
It wouldn't help much if you came.
Yeah, I know.
Let's talk later.
I should go.
So you're doing OK, right?
Did I tell you?
Sun-kyu and his wife are coming over.
It'll be alright.
I'll take care of it.
OK, bye.
Oh, right!
I invited Sun-kyu and his wife over for dinner this weekend.
Really?
It'll be nice for them to see the girls after so long.
And to catch up on things.
That was delicious.
Sorry, I have things to tend to.
You must be tired, so clean it up tomorrow.
Did you prepare your father's undergarments?
Thanks, but that's my job.
Cleaning my room is my job.
Why'd you touch my stuff?
That's how it was before.
So all the same clothes were hanging there before?
I'm not having dinner with him.
What?
I said I'm not having dinner with that guy.
He's not some guy, he's your uncle.
It's the first day, so let's give it a rest.
- And you?
- Yes?
Aren't you going after her?
You're supposed to follow your sister.
Did that woman say something to you?
If she ever gets on your case, then tell me.
And don't ignore it like before.
OK?
Good night.
What's wrong?
Did you have a bad dream?
Was it the wardrobe?
Then what's wrong?
I keep hearing strange noises outside.
It's because you've been away too long.
It's OK.
Let's sleep.
Somebody came into my room.
Dad's sleeping.
I know.
Then why are you trying to wake him?
Says who?
You were trying to wake him just now.
- Do you have something to tell him?
- It's none of your business.
All I'm saying is don't wake him up.
Do you understand me?
I just came downstairs for water.
He's asleep, so be quiet.
Did you go to my room?
Who was it?
That woman.
Stepmum?
It's strange.
What is?
That woman is strange.
And so is this house.
Are you scared?
Everything's alright.
I'm here.
Come here.
Let's sleep.
I'll always be with you.
Are you awake?
Yes.
- Can I come in?
- No.
Come down and eat.
What are you doing?
Are you having your period?
No, Su-yeon is.
Su-yeon?
That's so funny.
How could we both get our periods on the same day?
Su-mi.
It's OK, come down.
That's Mum's favourite, huh?
Do it like this.
- Shall we kill them?
- Let's set them free.
She'll freak out if we mess with her precious.
I would hate to see that.
Su-mi.
What are you doing out in the cold?
Are you alright?
- Something wrong with me?
- You don't look so good.
Are you feeling sick?
No, I'm OK.
Tell me what's wrong?
I said I'm OK.
Just get rid of the wardrobe in Su-yeon's room.
Su-mi, we agreed not to talk about that wardrobe.
You promised, right?
Su-mi...
I know you're very angry with me.
And I know I'm a bad father.
You're not even a bad father.
It's cold, let's get inside.
I will.
What are you doing?
You scared me.
When did you come in?
- Did you go to the warehouse?
- Yeah.
Su-yeon, look at this.
Ta-da!
Pretty, huh?
Are they Mum's?
There's more.
It's Mum!
Taritakoom, taritakoom.
What's that?
It's a spell to call Mum.
Who told you that?
Mum did.
- What?
- Can I take this?
Sure.
These.
- And these.
- Wait!
What's this?
Who did this to you?
Tell me, who did this?
It's OK, tell me.
She did this, huh?
She did this, didn't she?
Su-yeon, what's wrong with you?
I told you to tell me everything!
She did this, right?
She did this, huh?
Did she do this?
Tell me!
Tell me!
What?
How can you be so cruel?
It's retribution.
If you disobey, you need to be punished.
Does Dad know what you did?
Think your father can solve everything?
Then go get him.
Want me to do it?
Sit down!
Where are your manners?
Were you like this to your mum, too?
Don't bring up my mum.
Listen carefully.
I'm your mother, got it?
As much as you hate it,
I'm the only one in this world you can call Mother, got it?
Crying over your mum's photos won't change anything.
Hard to handle?
That's too bad, but that's how the world is.
The world isn't as sweet as you picture it.
Sometimes you have to bear the worst and live on.
Like the way I'm bearing you two!
What?
Why the hell did you even come here?
I can't believe you said that to me again.
You're not well yet, are you?
Don't touch me.
- Get off me!
- What's wrong with you?
Are you that clueless?
Don't touch me with those filthy hands!
Su-mi, listen to me.
I don't want to hear it.
You're the same.
That's not true, you've misunderstood.
You're not even accepting all this.
Why is it always me?
Why are you asking only me to understand?
You really don't know?
Maybe not.
I don't know, so tell me and get it off your chest.
Tell me.
Will it change anything?
Will it?
Su-mi...
Don't do this.
Please don't.
You'll get sick again.
What?
Fine.
How was your day today?
How was it?
Well then, shall we talk?
First, tell me about yourself
Who do you think you are?

be responsible for it all
I have nothing more to say so answer the phone
Do you remember?
My memory's a bit blurry but I think it did happen
When was it?
Hey, remember this?
You jumped into the river to catch some fish
Then you started to drown and everyone had a fit
There was another funny story
What was it?
Oh yeah, I remember
Remember that crazy guy?
The funny thing is is that he was always normal but whenever it rained he went nuts
While plowing the field he'd strip off his clothes when it rained and run out into the highway
The funniest time was when it rained off and on
So he'd put on and take off his clothes, again and again
Then he got sick of it and just went into his house
Everyone in the neighborhood laughed so much back then
But when...
But when he was little he saw him doing that once
He saw him doing that once and then he ran together with that crazy guy
Our mom saw that and she almost passed out
Do you remember?
You remember, right?
Say something
Don't you remember?
You remember, right?
No
I don't remember
What?
I said I don't remember
Why don't you remember?
Are you crazy?
Mi-hee!
Mi-hee!
Wait, hold on to her
- What's wrong?
- Wake up!
Bring some water
Are you alright, Mi-hee?
Water, water
I'm sorry, it's all my fault
Mi-hee!
It's okay
It's alright, Mi-hee
It's alright
I'm sorry
I didn't want to come but your father begged me to so I had no choice
- Honey
- Yes?
I saw something strange in that house
What did you see?
There was a girl under the sink
Just go in
- Can't you just stay here?
- Why?
It's strange
What's strange?
It's strange
After the girls came down weird things have been happening in this house
Don't say stupid things
Didn't you see it?
You're just having a hard time adjusting You'll get better if you rest
No
There's something in this house
I'll look around, so lie down
Open the door!
Open it!
Open the god damn door!
I'll show you
Get up!
Get off the bed
Get off now!
I said now!
Come here, right now!
You pest...
Talk!
A person can't get any rest around this household
Tell me Who did it?
Who did it?
Who?
Better tell me the truth
Who did it!
Was it Su-mi?
You two need to learn a lesson!
Was it your sister?
So do you feel better looking at your dead mom's things?
Feel happy after seeing the photos?
Say that you're sorry
Until you do, don't even think about coming out
There's no use in crying
Say that you're sorry and beg for forgiveness!
I'm sorry
What?
Say it right

What's going on, dear?
Oh!
The same vacancies and appointments.
There're a lot many ads but not a single vacancy.
Then, it's indeed great.
- What?
Yes.
Now, what do you have to do with a job?
You've completed your LLB and that's sufficient.
Papa, I love this profession very much.
If I practice it for a couple of years..
..Then, I'll get something to learn.
- Really?
Then, give it to me.
I too will help you.
And, that phone..
Priya.

Come fast, dear.
The breakfast is ready.
I'll be there right away, mom.
And, what are you doing here?
C'mon you as well.
Yes, I'm.

Today, at our.. at my place, a young and beautiful girl is..
..Gonna come for the interview for the post of secretary.
So, do as I say.
- Yes, sir.
I just go exhausted while I tried to know about you.
Where's the telephone?
Hello.
Yes, brother, this is Rakesh.
You too so long to pick up the telephone?
I can pick it up only if I'm able to see it.
I don't know what is kept where over here.
Even I told you to find a maid for me.
Were you able to find her?
Raj, it's not difficult for me to find a maid.
But, when I tell them that you're a bachelor..
..And you stay alone, then they instantly take to their heels.
Yeah, as if I'll jump on them as soon they step in over here.
Won't I be able to find a maid if I'm a bachelor?
I called you up to tell the same thing that I've spoken to a maid.
Where's she?
She'll be at your place by 10:30.
Moreover, she's an educated girl.
She'll also handle your phone calls along with the household chores.
Hey, send her fast.
I'm very much in trouble.
She's coming, man.
She's coming.
Have you ever drunk foam mixed tea?
- Nope.
I've just made it.
Then, do come here and drink.
Man, I've drank cardamom tea many a times..
..But, what's this foam tea?
Hey, stop!
Will you break my limbs?
Damn fellow, do you want to kill me under the bus?
Neither they let to board the bus properly..
..Nor they let to alight the bus properly!
If we stand, then the guys gather around.
They make a sandwich out of us.
They don't even give space to sit.
Let me take up a job!
Let alone boarding a bus, I won't even look at the bus stop.
All the houses are alike over here.
How will I search that one?
Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Sharma, how do you do?
Mr. Sharma, where have you sent me?
It seems that I'll myself get lost over here..
..Then, how the hell will I find the house owner.
You haven't reached there yet?
I even gave you the address to write down.
I didn't write it.
I thought there might be a couple of houses..
..And, I'll easily find it.
But, all the houses in here are similar.
Fine.
Listen then.
There's a Sai Baba temple over there.
That's behind me.
There's this lane right in front of it..
..And, the moment you reach there take a..
I got it.
I got it.
I'll call you later.
Hello!
How much?

Since, I'm able to see you before the interview.
I didn't ask him the house number.
Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Sharma, how do you do?
Now, how will I find it since you haven't told me the house number?
You don't even listen to the whole thing.
You cut the phone quite early.
Now, listen carefully.

13 means one three.
I do understand English.

By the way, who else is in your house?
It's just me and this Bunty.
And, your wife and kids?
Actually, I'm still a bachelor.

I enjoy working at bachelor's and lonely men's house.
The women folk just keep on nagging..

And, I've just passed LLB.
My certificates.
It seems that unemployment has increased.

And, it's a big honour for me to work under you.
And, I'll get learn a lot from you.
Fine. if you really want to do this job, then do it.
But, I can give you 1500 rupees per month.

But, you wrote 3000 in the ad.
- Ad?
Just think about it, sir.
The secretary to such a big lawyer and..
Lawyer?
- I mean barrister.
The secretary to such a big barrister and..
..The salary is just 1500 rupees.
I was just having fun.
What did I mention in the ad?

I'll pay you 3000.
Sir, am I fix?

So, the job is agreed for on my behalf.
I'll take 1500 rupees as salary.
And, not a penny less!
You'll take only 1500?
- Sir, what's there to do in your house?
Why will you do the household work?
Bunty is there for it.
Bunty will do my work?
Look, neither Bunty will do your work..
..Nor you'll do Bunty's work.
Then, it's fine.
But, one thing more.
I'll work from morning 7 till 9 at night.
And, I'll sleep in the bedroom.
In the bedroom?
Whose?
In my own.
You'll have to give me a bedroom.
As I won't sleep in the kitchen or the balcony..
..With the mattress spread out.
You mean..
You'll stay here?
If I work at your place then am I supposed to..
..Stay at the neighbour's place?
You talk very strange.
Okay.
Bunty, where do you sleep?
I won't sleep with Bunty.
Adjust it for a single night and then..
..I'll arrange everything for you tomorrow.
Don't you feel ashamed?
You're telling a girl to sleep in a boy's room.
No.
No.
He's not a boy.
He's a kid.
That's why I don't want to sleep him.
Do you know, there's no case filed on the kids.
Wow!
That's great.
I'm really impressed.
You've a sound knowledge of the law.
- Yes.
I was in search of a similar talent.
Now, you go home and bring you baggage..
..And, your room will be arranged.
I'll go right away and come right away.

Bye.
Good morning.

Good morning, sir.
I want to see you in the conference right now.

The design and features of our new handset RX49..
..Are indeed quite good.
And, now I want to know as to what are it's results..
..And when will it be able for a launch in the market?
So far, all our tests have been positive.
And, only the test of this handset is on a trial basis.
It's features, frequency, voice quality and battery life..
..Are still under observation.
So far, we've made around 50 handsets..
..And distributed among our staff.
And, as soon as the result comes, we'll be able to say..
..As to when we can it be launched in the market.
Whatever the progress is, please inform us.
Okay, sir.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.
- Thank you, sir.
I knew it from the first that this maid is definitely..
..Gonna create some problem.
But, the one who came in her place..
..Didn't you tell her anything?
I mean, that you don't want a secretary but a maid.
Am I mad to tell her that?
So that she leaves the job.
I don't want her ever to go away from me.
No problem if she stays as a secretary.
Of for that matter a maid.
I simply want that she be always close to me.
She shouldn't go far from me.
I got it.
I got your whole game.
But, just think, what if she comes to know that you're not a barrister?
And, that your family is not even distantly related..
..To the law and the court..
..Then what is gonna happen, my brother?
I don't know what to do.
You give me some idea.
You do one thing.
In order to keep her there in your house..
..You act as a lawyer for some days.
And, when you find the opportunity..
..Then, lovingly express the feeling of your heart to her.
Here.
Take whichever book you want.
By the way, if you want some advice for some case..
..Then, you can take it from me.
It's 100% discount for you.
No, Chotlani sir, I was just taking these for reference.
To increase my general knowledge..
Here.
Have some snacks?
Raj, she's Kanchan.
He's Raj.
Our neighbour.
How do you do?
- Fine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was saying that just finish of these drinks..
..And, I'll serve the dinner.
Brother, you too go after eating the food cooked by me.
Mr. Chotlani, who's she?
- She's my secretary.
I employed her today itself.
And, you're making her prepare snacks from now itself?
No, Raj.
She's in habit of these things.
Preparing the snacks, cooking the food, sweeping the house.
I gave her a letter to type in the afternoon..
..And she said, 'How funny you're being?
'
Well, she's willing to work for 1500 rupees.
And, I gave the ad for 3000 bucks.
I got it.
- What?
That you got a maid and a secretary in 1500 bucks.
You just don't let her go.
That's it.
- Done.
Catch hold of her.
I am living sir.
- Okay.
And, return these books soon.
I can need them any moment.
Yeah, but just don't let her go.
- Okay.
She has come.
Come in.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Sir, I'm exactly on time.
I'll make the tea for you.
I've had the tea.
You better have a seat.
Sir, are you searching a reference for some case?
Yeah.
It's a bit complicated case.
Should I help you, sir?
No, no.
Today is your first day.
I don't want you to involve yourself in such a complicated case.
I'll solve it.
And, I'll give you a straight and simple case.
You better work on it.
Fine?
This case is a very important case.
Tell me, sir?
Yeah, write it down.
There's a friend of mine, Raj Malhotra.
Raj is an engineer.
When he was alone, then he could..
..Neither take care of himself nor he of the house.
He thought of employing a maid.
I mean a housemaid.
A girl arrived.
And, Raj employed her.
Now, the problem is, the girl was going..
..To someone else's house for the secretary's job..
..But, by mistake she arrived at Raj's house..
..And, Raj employed her.
Sir, your friend shouldn't have done that.
He should have sent her back giving her the right address.
He made an educated girl into a maid?
No, Priya.
It's not like that.
Actually, he found the girl nice.
He felt that if the girl comes in this house..
..Then the house too would turn nice.
In this house?
I mean, in Raj Malhotra's house.
That means, love at first sight.
- Exactly.
Now, this was the case of Raj Malhotra.
Just think what might be the girl's reaction..
..If she comes to know about it.
Will she file a case against Raj?
Or will both them reach an out of court settlement.
Just think.
Fine, sir.
I'll think over both the points.
Great.
I'll leave for the office.
- Office?
I mean, I'll leave for the court.
It's my hearing today.
And, if any call comes for me..
..Then do attend it.
Okay?
- Okay, sir.
And, these are some law books.
So, refer from them.
Fine.
Don't just apply your mind to this case but also your heart.
Of course, sir.
- Fine?
Take care.
- Okay.
Raj.
- Yes?
Where's Raj?
- Who's Raj?
Raj Malhotra.
- Raj Malhotra?
Don't you know Raj Malhotra?
- I do know.
He's Mr. Chotlani's friend.
- Correct.
So, where's he?
- I don't know.
He might be at his house.
Hold it.
Hold it.
So, whose house is it?
Who stays over here?
Barrister Ram Chotlani stays here.
Ram Chotlani?
You mean to say that I stay over here?
I eat and drink and sleep in bungalow number 13..
..And I pay all it's phone bills, tax bills and municipal bills..
..And I stay over here?
You're Mr. Chotlani?
- Yes.
And, I don't stay here but there.
Raj Malhotra stays here.
Wait.
Last night he brought some law books from my house.
I've come to take them back.
A client has come.
Should I take them?
Thank you.
Oh my God!
Look here.
He keeps the law books along with the waste papers.
And, you think of him as Barrister Ram Chotlani?
Wow!
Wonderful!
Nice to meet you.
Relax.
There's a friend of mine, Raj Malhotra.
Raj is an Engineer.
He thought of employing a maid.
Then he kept a girl.
Do you know, isn't it, as to what all you've to do?
Don't just apply your mind to this case but also your heart.
Actually, he found the girl nice.
He felt that if the girl comes in this house..
..Then the house too would turn nice.
That means, love at first sight.
- Exactly.
Love at first sight.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Priya.
Today, our house doesn't seem to be ours.
There was no client or any phone call since morning.
And as I was free so I thought why not clean the house.
It doesn't look like a bachelor's house.
Sir, you had a case in the court..
..What happened to it?
Which case?
Oh!
That case.
My client got the degree.
And, you very well know, there's no question of defeat.
My arguments sealed the public prosecutor's mouth.
He was glad.
And, he said to me to occupy his chair.
I said, 'Brother, why are you making fun of a junior?
'
So did you think about my friend's case that I gave you?
Oh!
That case!
Sir, I applied my heart and mind to that case.
It's a big problem.
The girl can file a fraud case.
Sir, there's no way that your friend Raj Malhotra could be saved.
What?
There's no way?
Sir, it's not in the court.
Maybe, there is, if an out of court settlement is reached.
How come?
Look, girls like people who are truthful.
So, if you tell your friend to tell the..
..Whole truth to that girl then the problem..
This is the problem.
The poor guy isn't able to say anything.
Why?
ls he mute?
He's not mute.
Rather he doesn't have the courage.
Okay. if he doesn't have the courage..
..Then, tell him to do one thing.
Tell him to write down a confession letter.
And, you can handle the rest on your friend's behalf.
This is the right idea.
Very good.
Very good.
You do one thing.
Take the pen and paper and start writing.
Yes.
Sit down.
Sit down fast.
Write..
Miss Priya..
Miss Priya, her name is also Priya.
When I saw you for the first time..
..My gaze just froze at your sight.
And, I couldn't decide, whether you had come to me..
..For the job of a housemaid or a barrister's secretary.
It's just that I kept you.
I dreaded that if I tell you the truth..
..Then, you might leave me and go away.
Because I need you.
Maybe, I've gone through love at first sight.
And, if I've hurt you, then do forgive me.
Sir..
Should I write, Yours Raj Malhotra?
Yeah.
Write Raj Malhotra.
What do you think?
If that girl reads this letter, then will she resign..
..Or will she accept Raj Malhotra?
Had I wanted to resign then I could have gone away..
..With Barrister Ram Chotlani, when..
..He came to take away his law books.
And, I wouldn't have sat here and..
..Wrote the love letter of Raj Malhotra.
That means..
You know everything?
Yes.
That means you don't have any objection to accept me?
Not at all.
Not at all?
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
Every style of yours if quite different from the others.
And hence, I'm going gaga over you.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
O beloved, please do tell.
That I'm only but yours.
And, indeed the steps are going astray in the path of love.
O beloved, please do tell.
That I'm only but yours.
And, indeed the steps are going astray in the path of love.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
You made me go crazy at the first instance.
And, O sweetheart, I was spell-bounded at your face.
You made me go crazy at the first instance.
And, O sweetheart, I was spell-bounded at your face.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
Every style of yours if quite different from the others.
And hence, I'm going gaga over you.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone.
Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
Enough.
Enough.
Stop it before the shore arrives.
Now, we'll walk from over here.
- Why?
C'mon.
I want to give you a surprise.
C'mon.
Get ready for the surprise.
C'mon.
Happy?
Put the left leg first.
- What's the need of this parade?
C'mon, put it.
Left right.
- Left right.
Left right.
- Left right.
Always ready for a fight.
- Left right.
It's a boy!
Boy?
Had you put the left foot first then it would have been a girl.
You mean to say..
Yes.
Seven months later, your son will be in my lap.
I just can't believe you.
I love you, Priya.
I love you.
You've given me everything in my life.
- I love you too.
Now, I too will give you a surprise.
But, there's no need of a left right for that.
We've to just walk straight.
How did you find this bungalow?
- Too beautiful.
Isn't it?
Come.
Now, tell me, how does this bungalow look from over here?
Beautiful.
But, whose bungalow is this?
Right now, it's belong to the builder..
..But, it will belong to us in a day or two.
What?
- We're purchasing this bungalow?
Congratulations, Raj.
Your loan has been sanctioned.
Now, you can take this bungalow's possession in a day or two.
Take this property papers.
- By the way, this is Priya.
My wife.
And, this is Amar.
A very good friend of mine.
He's a manager in HDFC and he was instrumental..
..In the sanction of our loan.
Sister-in-law, tell me, how do you find this bungalow?
Very nice.
- Good.
Okay, Raj.
Then, I'll take a leave.
Wish you all the best.
- Thank you very much.
Bye.
Raj, what's the cost of this bungalow?
- 3 crores.
3 crores?
But, Raj, all your salary will go away in monthly instalments.
Priya, I haven't taken a loan of 3 crores.
I have done some savings in my life.
And, I've given that to the builder as an advance.
That means, you've invested all your bank balance in this bungalow?
You don't worry.
I have taken every step carefully.
Look, next week it's the annual day of our company.
And, I'll be given the post of Chief Executive Officer that day.
That means, Raj Malhotra will become the CEO.
What?
- Yes.
And, my salary will get a foursome raise.
Moreover, I've some shares in the company.
This is indeed a great surprise, Raj.
But, this is nothing as compared to the surprise..
..That you gave me today in the morning.
I love you, Priya.
Congrats, sir.
- Thank you.
Today you'll become the CEO.
Will you give the party?
See here.
The village hasn't been settled as yet..
..And, the dacoits have already come to loot him.
And, let the chairman come first.
First let the announcement take place.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you.
Good morning, sir.
Come.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Today is the happiest day for all of us.

On behalf of the whole Roy group of companies..

..L congratulate you all heartily.
Ladies and Gentlemen, today's annual celebration..
..Is being celebrated as the birthday of Voice mobile.
And, on this birthday, the company will seek..
..Your performance as gifts and, it will give you promotions as gifts.
But, before that, I want to introduce you all..
..To two very special people.
I hope you'll welcome them.
First of all, my new wife, Mrs. Sonia Roy!
Brother, the girl turned out to be his wife.
I thought she is his grand daughter.
And, the second personality is the managing director of this company..
Again.
Mrs. Sonia Roy.
Now, Mrs. Sonia Roy will announce the promotions.
Thank you.
- Come.
Good morning, everybody.
At first, my congratulations to you all..
..For the fifth anniversary of Voice mobile.
Mr. Bhargav.
Correct.
The promotion list of junior staff has been sent..
..To their department heads.
And, these are this year's three major promotions.
The first promotion is of the senior sales officer.
And, that goes to Mr. Ashok Varma.
Congratulations.
And, the second is of the manager of engineering department.
And, that goes to Mr. Ramesh Diwan.
Well done!
Well done!
And now, ladies and gentlemen..
..The third and last promotion of this year..
..That is of the chief executive officer that means the CEO.
And, this goes to Mr. Rakesh Sharma..
..Of the research and development department.
Congrats.
And now, ladies and gentlemen..
..I'm about to make a special announcement.
A new name has been included in the..
..Board of directors of the company.
And, that lucky name is, Mr. Raj Malhotra.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
And, I hope to see you at the party tonight.
Bye, bye.
Come, darling.
One minute.
- That was great, man.
Hello, sir.
- Hello.
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you very much.
I never expected that you'll give me such a big post.
I don't deserve that thank you, but my wife Sonia does.
That was her decision.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Roy.
Call me Sonia.
Thank you.
I hope that you'll carry on your past performance in the future.
And, you'll satisfy me and the company in the same way.
Of course.
See you at the party, young man.
- Yes, sir.
Come.
Mr. Khanna, if a man has brain..
..Then, he can verily sell his pain.
It's the thing that people, let alone buy..
..Are not even ready to take a look at.
What else do I've other than brain?
The businessman who doesn't have brain..
..Will definitely sink his company.
Hi.
Hi.
My wife Priya.
Our new MD..
- Sonia.
Hello.
Your wife is indeed very beautiful, Raj.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Raj.
Good evening.
Sir, my wife Priya.
- Hello.
And, the chairman of our company, Mr. Roy.
Nice meeting you.
Enjoy the party.
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Darling, come, I'll introduce you to my old friends.
Excuse me.
Raj, why did Mr. Chairman call Sonia as darling?
Because, she is his wife.
What?
They both are husband and wife?
- Don't you feel so?
No.
I feel as if he's her father.
Cheers!
Cheers to the new director on the board of directors.
And, cheers to the new CEO.
- Thank you.
All right.
Raj, what spell did you cast on the MD..
..That he made you the director instead of the company's CEO.
It's my personality.
And it's the spell of it.
And, it's been cast.
What a figure, man?
Neither a millimetre here nor a millimetre there.
The Lord Almighty might have made this hot thing..
..While sipping a cold coffee.
Just leave it, man.
What useless things are you blabbering?
Really?
There's no doubt that I find her sexy and attractive.
Don't you feel likewise?
- No. - Tell me the truth.
I do feel.
But, she's our boss' wife, man.
That's the point worth weeping, Raj..
..That she's the wife of a 70-75 year old man.
One must go and tell that old fellow..
..That even the Viagra won't work on him in this age.
What's the discussion, buddy?
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Sir, Rakesh was saying a lot many things in your praise.
My praise?
When was I doing that?
Man, you're..
Why are you shying away from sir?
Tell him.
No, sir.
I simply keep talking crap.
Talking crap?
So, let me hear it as well.
I was..
I was actually..
Speak up.
Tell me.
Sir, I was saying that you and Madam Sonia make a nice pair.
Is this crap?
I mean to say, madam Sonia is so beautiful.
- And, me?
You..
You're very graceful, sir and very..
Energetic.
- Yes, energetic.
And, you're very young.
I mean, it will take another 30-35 years..
..For you to complete the century.
Good evening, everybody.
Thank you so much for your attention.
This evening, this night and this sea.
Today, in this beautiful ambience, there's none..
..A boss over here and nor anyone an employee.
Today, all of us are one.
So, come.
Let's make this beautiful evening more beautiful.
The wild waves of the ocean are waiting to engulf you.
So, ladies and gentlemen, brace yourself for the love.
When one falls in love with someone.
And, when the waves dash into each other.
When the storm rises in the sea.
Then, the subtle are the ones to get scared.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
We're in the midst of this quagmire.
But, yet we're lost somewhere in the quagmire.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
We're in the midst of this quagmire.
But, yet we're lost somewhere in the quagmire.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
When loves crosses its limits.
The pain begins to scale up the breath.
But if the pain is dewy and cool.
The body begins to burn and squirm.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
If it's true love in the heart.
Then, the ship of love indeed crosses the sea storm.
The waves keep on coming and the waves keep on going.
And, they've no impact as they keep on getting hurt.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
The motion of the waves is quite strange.
So, try to be careful, O beloved.
This journey of love seems to be in the dark.
So, I don't know why I'm scared of getting drowned.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
When one falls in love with someone.
And, when the waves dash into each other.
When the storm rises in the sea.
Then, the subtle are the ones to get scared.
It's good.
Tomorrow, we'll be shifting to our new house.
At least, we're getting rid of this rental place.
Are you done with the packing?
- Yes.
Some big things are left, I'll pack them tomorrow morning.
Today, I wore the Sari for the first time.
How was I looking?
- Cute.
Glamorous.
For once I thought that I should abduct from over there.
But, then I thought that it's my own property.
My own wife.
What if it was someone else?
She wouldn't have been ravishing like you.
Should I ask you one thing, Raj?
- Yes.
Your Mrs. MD is young and beautiful and educated..
..Then, why did she got married to an old man like Mr. Roy?
What have we got to do with it?
It's their personal matter.
Forget it.
I didn't find her behaviour and attitude quite nice.
You be simply concerned with your work in the office.
Oh my God!
My keys?
Where did I drop them?
Oh, no!
- What happened?
My keys are inside.
Can you help me?
This car can be opened only by a car mechanic or a car thief.
And, I'm none among them.
If you wish, then I can give you a lift.
Don't get embarrassed.
You can take lift from someone else.
Because anyone can give lift to a beautiful girl like you.
And, I'm just one of them.
I didn't mean that.
I really didn't mean it like that.
Come.
I'll drop you.
Here.
Wear this.
- Why?
What's the need for it?
Those clothes are wet.
Take.
And, my seat can get spoilt as well.
Are you lndian?
- Yes.
Who else is in your house?
- I live with a friend of mine..
..Who has gone to Canada.
So, right now I'm alone.
And, you?
I work in a company over here.
And, what do you do?
These days, I simply do exercises.
Tomorrow, I've an audition.
If I'm selected in that..
..Then, probably, I'll start working as well.
For which company?
MTN mobile phone. it's for their modelling.
Just take a left ahead.
That's it.
Well, the manners dictate that I should be calling you in..
..And I should be serving you tea..
..But, I've to go to the Yoga classes.
And, I'm already late.
And, I've to make a lot of preparations for the audition tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Tomorrow, you'll be selected.
- Really?
You think so?
I don't think so.
I mean so.
So, if I'm selected tomorrow then I'll give you a treat.
Promise?
- Promise.
Cool.
- Bye.
T shirt.
Sorry.
Thank you.
By the way, Raj.
- Sonia.
Best of luck.
- Thanks.
I am thinking about you, only you.
No, you can't miss me.
Because I have freedom with MTN.
Cut it.
Congratulations Miss Sonia you have been selected.
Selected!
You mean?
- Yes.
You have been selected, Sonia.
Because you have great style, amazing posture and top of it..
..You look stunning
- Thank you.
Miss.
Sonia this is Raj Malhotra..
..Marketing Executive Director of M.T.N.
Yeah, that's me.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Just see, opportunity is such a strange thing.
Yesterday, I went to such a beach wherein no one comes.
And, it's over there that my key remains inside my car.
And, I got a lift from you.
Now, what can we do if your career was to start through us?
It seems that you're my good luck charm.
But, your good luck charm hasn't forgotten that you've..
..Promised to give a treat after your selection.
Do you remember it?
- That's right.
Sure?
- Done.
Good.
That should be okay.
Enjoy the drink, sir.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
This is for your success.
No.
It's for our friendship.
Wanna dance?
- Why not?
You're the fragrance and you're the magic.
You're the fragrance and you're the magic.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you.
You're the fragrance and you're the magic.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you.
I never had an idea, O sweetheart..
..That the heart might get crazy.
And, the spell of desire might work on me as well.
You're quite interesting.
As your memories occur quite often.
I have no more control on myself.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you, baby.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you.
What's that attraction in you as none is as beautiful as you.
And, this pain of detachment is intolerable.
The passion is all over the mind.
And, it's now that I'm feeling at peace.
I really want to seek you.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you, baby.
Hey, you, this heart's crazy over you.
Sonia.
Sonia!
Sorry.
Sorry.
There's such a nice buffet set at the pool side..
..And we've come here in this ruckus.
It's for a change, Raj.
Oh, c'mon.
Can I have your order please?
- Thank you.
It's a nice place.
- Do you love it?
Yeah.
Julie!
- Hello, Ajay!
How are you?
Two muppels and..
Raj, I'll just be back from the living room.
- Yeah, sure.
And that should be okay.
Your drink, sir.
- Thank you.
Sonia, what were you doing there?
Raj, do you know who he is?
- I know.
His name is Ajay Singh.
- Yes!
And, he has come to South Africa from India..
..To search for a brand ambassador for his product.
So, I deliberately attracted him towards me.
Now, you see, he'll himself come over here.
So, this was..
Excuse me.
Ajay Singh.
- Hl!
Sonia.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine, beautiful lady.
Thank you.
He's my friend Raj.
- Hello.
If your friend doesn't mind, then can I dance with you?
Of course.
Why will Raj mind?
- Come.
I've come here in search of a brand ambassador.
By the way, what do you think about me?
I guess, I've made my choice.
I like it.
What kind of behaviour is this?
You came back from the hotel without informing me..
..And leaving me alone?
- So, what did you want?
That I should have watched your dance with Ajay Singh?
What nonsense?
- Just leave it.
Raj, I'm a model.
My degree and diploma are my beauty.
And, I've to just push them forth for success.
That's it.
It's a part of our profession.
And, do you know, I got the contract for that single dance.
That means you can do anything for contract and money, right?
What do you mean by anything?
I'm not making a contract to sleep with him.
They need my body to promote their product..
..And they're ready to give me a price for it.
That's it.
It's strictly professional!
But, I don't like all this.
I can't see all this.
Raj, you've become completely possessive.
No matter wherever the Indian man is..
..No matter whatever he does..
..He'll always be an Indian.
Typical MCP.
Male Chauvinist Pig.
But, you know what?
I love it like that.
Hey, listen to me.
I love you.
Truly.
Honestly.
Take me.
You really love me, isn't it?
- Of course.
And, you really want me to fulfil..
..All those dreams that I've seen so far, isn't it?
Yes, I want.
Then, let me sign the contract.
Please.
They want to make me the brand ambassador of their company.
This is a very important step for my career.
Please.
Please, Raj.
How will I refuse you if you ask me in such a position?
Wow!
Look at this Indian model.
What a fantastic figure!
She's really hot and sexy!
Man!
So bold and so beautiful!
The one who has seen her photo..
..Might be searching for her address.
Show me as well.
I'll be back.
Where are you going?
At least keep the magazine and go.
I need it the most right now.
Maria, this is Raj here.
Can I speak to Sonia?
She's gone to the hospital.
Between 5 to 10 minutes she'll be back at home.
Where is she?
- She's upstairs.
Thank you.
Sonia, why did you go to the hospital?
I just went for a routine check-up, Raj.
But, the doctor told me that I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
This is good news.
Why didn't you tell me?
This isn't some disease so that I should have told you.
We stay together and we didn't took any precautions..
..And it just happened.
By the way, there's nothing to worry about.
I've taken an appointment for tomorrow.
So, I'll go and get an abortion done.
Abortion?
What's the need for abortion?
Sonia, we'll get married.
Raj..
I'm not getting an abortion because I'm having a child out of wedlock.
But, I'm having an abortion because I don't want a child..
..At this stage of my career.
What are you talking, Sonia?
This is our love.
This is our child.
But, this is not my ambition, Raj.
You very well know as after how many difficulties..
..I've got a chance to move ahead.
I've seen a world of different dream for myself.
Power, prestige, status, money..
I want to be on top of this world, Raj.
That means I don't have any value in your life?
And, you don't love me?
- Who told you that I don't love you?
I love you very much and I'll do it forever.
But, I can't sacrifice my career at this stage.
Whatever it is, Sonia.
You'll give birth to my child.
You're not going to abort the child.
You're talking as if you're my husband.
Raj this child is mine.
It's inside me.
And, what has to be done with it..
..It's only me, who can decide that.
I've just stepped on the first ladder of my success.
And, there are many a ladders ahead, wherein I can't be..
..Able to step with the burden of children and marriage.
That means, till today you just regarded me..
..As a ladder to your success?
And, you don't need me.
A successful woman doesn't need anyone, Raj.
She can keep her success as her husband..
..And, can also play with it as a child.
Then, there's a lot of difference between our thoughts.
You'll definitely get success.
Success can never evade a woman like you.
You want to go on the top of this world, isn't it?
Go.
But keep one thing in mind.
When you look down from over there..
..Then, you won't find anyone as your own.
Just remember my word.
Raj!
Child, you did a great thing by buying your house.
How long could you've stayed in that rented place?
Here.
Live long.
Prosper by the grace of God.
Come.
Sit, papa.
Mummy, you too sit down.
Yeah, child.
Come here, child.
Yes, Sharma, tell me?
Raj, can you come to the office for a while?
Why?
What happened?
That new handset of ours..
RX49..
There's some problem in its functioning.
We could have discussed had you come over here.
It's very urgent, pal.
Fine.
I'll come right away.
Bye.
Priya.
- Yes?
I'll have to go to the office?
- Now?
Yeah, there's some important work.
Okay?
Okay, mama.
Okay, papa.
See you.
- Yeah, child.
Listen.
- Yeah?
I've invited everybody for tonight's party..
..If someone is left out then do call and invite them.
Bye.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Tell Rakesh to come and meet me in my cabin.
And, why have you made this bird's nest on your head?
These are curls?
- These are curls.
We met, separated, we met again.
It's co-incidence.
But, this co-incidence is indeed nice.
Love, Sonia.
Hi, Raj.
- Hi.
What happened?
What's problem with the handset?
Buddy, the handsets that we distributed..
..In our staff for the observation..
..Some of them are complaining that..
..Two numbers get connected at the same time.
What?
- Yes, Raj.
They said that when they dial a number..
..Then the other number from the phone book gets dialled..
..All by itself and their call goes on a two way conference.
How can that happen?
Have you ordered for a check-up of the handset?
Sit.
Yeah, man.
I got everything checked..
..But, I'm unable to understand anything.
Really?
Do this.
Just halt the production till the check-up of the handset.
Raj, it would have been proper to talk to madam Sonia..
..Before halting the production.
I mean..
That's right.
Yes.
Please go through this contract.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hello?
- Madam, Mr. Raj Malhotra wants to meet you.
Tell him that he can come.
- Yes, madam.
Excuse me, gentleman.
An urgent meeting has come up.
Can we do this in another half an hour?
- Okay.
Thank you.
Come in.
Hi, Raj.
- Hi!
Please, have a seat.
I sent you some flowers.
Did you get them?
- Yes.
Thank you for the flowers.
And, there was a card along.
Did you read it?
Yes.
I read it.
Raj, I'm very much happy at your promotion, but..
..There's no excitement in you in regard to my congratulation.
Perhaps, you just saw and read my words.
But, you didn't feel them.
Sonia, the thing is..
That RX49 model of ours is having a technical problem..
..And I wanted to discuss something about it with you.
Should we discuss it now?
Oh!
So, you just want to talk that?
- Yeah.
But, I'm sorry.
It will take a long time.
Our clients from the Asian zone have come.
And, a very important meeting is in progress.
Shall we discuss it later?
Should we make it after lunch?
You talk to my PA.
He'll inform you about that.
Fine.
Thank you.
Hello?
- I am Bhagwat speaking.
- Yes?
Madam had to go out for an urgent meeting.
She has called you home in the evening.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Are you Mr. Raj?
- Yes.
- Please come, sir.
Please have a seat, sir.
- Thank you.
Good evening, madam.
- Good evening, Raj.
You are looking ravishing.
- Thank you.
Are you going for a party?
You have met me today after so many years.
Is this less than any party?
Sit down.
- Thank you.
What will you have?
Anything cold?
Or something hot?
Nothing.
How is life, Raj?
Everything is fine.
You can go.
- Okay.
Madam.
Miss Sonia..
I am sorry.
Our new mobile handsets, RX - 49 models.
There are some faults in that.
The handsets given to the staff for observation..
..There are complaints in it that whenever a number is..
..Dialled, the next number in the memory..
..Also gets connected.
So basically it becomes..
..It becomes a three way conference.
A report was sent to the RD department.
They have sent for the chip for rectification.
But the production has started.
We will have to stop it.
So, for that we will need your orders.
So stop it.
Do what you want.
No, your signatures are needed for that so..
..Please sign this.
- What is the hurry, Raj?
I will sign wherever you tell me to.
Your phone is ringing.
Hello.
Hi, baby.
- Sweetheart, do you miss me too?
I was thinking about you.
- Beloved..
You remember that we have to go to the party today?
I will not be able to come to the party.
I am very tired.
It was the first day of the office, isn't it?
You have given me such a huge responsibility.
Understand.
I am extremely sorry.
- Please sit.
No, darling.
I am very tired today.
Please forgive me this time.
What are you doing?
I am not doing anything new.
- All this is wrong.
Okay.
You think that all this is wrong now.
Without whom you couldn't stay..
No..
Sonia..
You were right.
I will get success.
But staying away from you, I have always felt..
..How lonely I am.
- No, Sonia.
Try to understand.
You went so far away from me.
You went so far away from me, Raj.
Sonia.
Please let me go.
- I love you, Raj.
I missed you so much.
Please, Sonia.
No.
Look at me.
Raj.. show me you are an animal.
Show me.
I love you, Raj.
I love you so much.
Nothing means so much..
As much as you, Raj.
Raj..
Raj.. what happened, Raj?
Raj..
listen to me.
No..
- Raj, what happened, Raj?
Sonia.
What we are doing is wrong.
Nothing is wrong, Raj.
Come on, love me.
Sorry.
- Raj, nothing is wrong.
- Please let me go.
You cannot me leave me alone, Raj.
I cannot betray my wife.
Leave me.
Raj..
listen to me Raj.
Raj!
Where did I tell you to leave your wife?
I just want a physical relationship.
I don't want this physical relationship.
Leave me!
If I don't have any problems, why are you bothered?
Raj..
listen to me.
Raj.
You cannot leave me like this, Raj.
You are insulting me.
I made you a director of the company..
..From a common executive, so that you be with me.
Near me!
Not because you deserved it.
This relation will be a ladder of success for you.
I have power, position and money today.
I can make you reach places!
Just think about it.
When you slept with me, you didn't want to be my wife.
Now when you are someone else's wife..
..You are adamant on sleeping with me?
It is god's grace that I didn't marry you.
Otherwise, the way you are generous on me for sex..
..You would be generous on Ranjit Roy for money.
Raj!
Raj!
What do you think?
I am a bitch?
I am a slut?
I am a bloody prostitute?
You think that I am a male prostitute..
..So that you use me in lieu of the..
..Money and post that you gave me?
No!
Raj!
Raj!
Raj!
Raj, Whatever you did was not right.
It was very wrong!
Raj..
Priya..
Where were you for so long?
Nothing.
I was stuck up in a meeting.
Therefore, I am late.
Your mobile was shut down too.
No. the mobile is on.
The battery is down.
There is a party in the house.
All the guests are waiting.
I am sorry, Priya.
I know I am very late.
You take care of the guests.
I will freshen up.
Please..
- Okay.
I tell you.
You have taken the glass once again.
That is strange.
It is strange.
I thought that after marriage you'd..
..Prepare a peg for me with your own hands.
Forget about preparing a peg, you..
..Want to kick the prepared peg too!
You married me to make pegs for you?
- No.. no..
I will try to execute my plan in a different manner.
I mean..
The thirst should become water now.
What does that mean?
That means, the thirst should become water now.
Every drop.. every drop should become a rose.
If you give it to me with your own hands..
..Mineral water will be turned into alcohol too.
Wow!
Her hands are of a very alcoholic type.
Why shouldn't they be?
Why shouldn't they be?
I used to scrub the tables of fifty..
..Drunkards in my life.
What happened?
Hi, Priya!
- Hi!
- Congrats.
Beautiful house.
- Thank you.
Neither am I a poet, nor am I am a poet's nephew.
I am just the result of my parent's entertainment.
Wow!
- What are you talking about?
Mr. Sharma is flirting a lot today.
It seems that he has fallen in love or something.
Love?
What is love?
Fool!
You don't know what love is?
I will tell you what love is.
Love is that Italian flooring where one..
..Feels like sweeping and swabbing incessantly.
- Wow!
Forget about sweeping and swabbing now.
Why do you forget that you aren't what you were any more?
Now you are the legally wedded wife to Ram Chotlani.
I forget it!
Hello, everybody.
Raj!
Welcome!
Maybe this is the first party where..
..The guests are welcoming the hosts.
Mr. Chotlani, you are hitting me swaddling it in a blanket!
No!
It's a beautiful house.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What were you talking about?
They were telling Rakesh what love is.
You don't know what love is?
I am a bit confused.
Either it is a case, or it is an Italian marble flooring.
Everyone has described love according to themselves.
Tell us.
What is your definition of love?
Mr. Chotlani.. according to me, love is love.
Which has faith passion and loyalty.
And it is this loyalty, that doesn't..
..Allow a person to be become disloyal.
Wow!
Did you understand now?
Yes, sister-in-law.
I understood it now.
Now tell me.
What happens when one falls in love?
That's a good question.
- Tell us.
Tell us please.
Tell them.
Tell them.
It is your turn now.
That scene of romance, that romantic heart.
That crazy season, that flirting of yours.
It makes me restless.
That love!
Those days of love, that moment, that time.
That trickling season, that monsoon.
That movement of breath, that aromatic veil.
That embrace, that cloud of tresses.
That shyness of yours, lowering of eyes.
That sudden turn as you go.
You understanding it, without me saying it.
That saying everything in signals.
Those fights and nags, repenting later.
Getting angry and then talking it out.
Returning once again.
What happened?
You thought that it was someone else?
No.. just like that.
Why were you startled?
I was thinking about something else.
If the husband thinks of something else..
..In the bedroom, it isn't a good sign.
Why only in the bedroom?
If the husband has anyone in the mind..
..Except the wife, it isn't a good thing.
Raj.. it was a good party.
All of them were happy.
Even I liked it.
Everyone praised you.
Everyone praised the house.
They praised the food too.
Did anyone praise my beloved?
I only like my husband praising me.
And I like it the most when people praise you.
When will you praise me now?
What I do is enough already.
When he will come forget praise, if you call me..
..Twenty times, I will answer once.
I am coming!
Another thing.
That fault report..
- Yes.
Send it to my desk by evening.
- Good morning sir.
Hi.
Morning.
Sir.
The chairman is waiting for you since a long time.
- Okay.
Keep this inside.
- Yes.
Sir.
Good morning, Sir.
Sir, you called me.
This is your resignation letter.
Sign this.
You are resigning from this company.
But why, sir?
You are asking me this?
I should tell you this?
How dare you attempt to rape my wife?
- What?
I said.. sign it.
Sir.
This is a lie!
An utter lie.
Sonia.. what is all this going on?
What did you tell him about me?
Tell me..
Don't talk to her.
You speak to my wife in my presence?
Sign this letter and get lost from here.
Sir, listen to me.
- Shut up.
I don't want me and my company to be defamed.
Therefore, I am just asking you for a resignation.
Sir..
- The wretched thing that you did..
I would have shot you for that!
Get out!
Sir..
listen to me..
- Get out from here.
- Listen to me..
I want this letter signed within twenty four hours.
What Sonia told you is wrong, sir.
- Get lost!
Stop it, darling.
Please.
Control yourself.
Why are you increasing your blood pressure?
- How dare he!
Please baby.
For me.. please.
Come on.
Come on.
Idiot.
What is his worth?
Why don't you people believe me?
I didn't do this.
Forget about doing it.
I can't even think about it.
Rakesh, this is the truth.
This Sonia is trying to trap me.
She called me home.
She tired to exploit me sexually.
And when I refused, she accused me!
And.. and see.
She gave me this resignation letter.
She tells me to sign it.
Why should I resign?
I will not resign.
You are my friend, isn't it?
You are my friends.
You are my colleagues.
You don't believe me?
Raj.
I discussed your matter with the whole staff once you left.
Nobody believed it.
What do you mean to say?
If nobody believed it..
..L should accept that what I have been accused..
..Of is true?
I should give the resignation?
No.
I don't want you to resign.
See.
Everyone can commit a mistake.
If I were in your place maybe I'd have committed the same mistake.
See, Raj.
Even if I do believe you..
Will you be able to prove that you are innocent?
Forget all this.
Think only about your service right now.
You have taken such a big loan and bought a bungalow.
If you resign, from where will you repay this loan?
Listen to what I say.
Go to Mr. Rai and beg of him.
Tell him that you committed a mistake.
After that..
You have gone crazy.
What do you want?
I should beg of him..
..And that too for the mistake that I didn't commit?
Keep your suggestions to yourself.
If you don't give the bank another guarantee..
..The bank will seize your bungalow.
Just because you are a man, it doesn't..
..Mean that you will do anything and I will forgive you.
I want a divorce.
I am leaving you now.
See, Raj.
Sexual exploitation is nothing new.
Men do this with women in big companies and offices.
But this is a different case.
A woman has tried to sexually exploit you.
As far as our society's mindset is concerned..
..These kind of wretched antics are reserved for men.
Mr. Chotlani, how will I get justice?
If you wish, we can have a case of sexual harassment.
But..
It will be difficult to prove.
The chances to win are less..
And listen to the side effects of defeat too.
Newspapers need such spices.
They will print you on the front page.
They will defame you by making you famous.
Women's organizations will make your life hell.
You will lose your service.
You will fall so low in people's eyes..
..That nobody will be ready to give you work too.
Raj, this is the question of a big company and it's MD.
They will accuse you of attempted..
..Rape to save their prestige and dignity.
And I am sorry but maybe they will prove it too.
After that.. seven years of rigorous imprisonment.
Did you tell this to Priya?
- No.
- Good.
Good.
Look, Raj.
I am your friend.
I suggest you as a friend.
Resign.
And give any excuse to Priya and..
..Go somewhere far away with her.
Raj..
You are resigning from the job?
I found this resignation letter from your coat pocket.
Yes.
But why?
Sonia has accused me of attempted rape.
What?
- Yes.
The truth is that when I went to..
..Her house to discuss the problems in mobiles..
..She tried to exploit me sexually.
When I refused, she accused me.
Today, using her power, she wants to chuck me out of the company.
So much has occurred, and you didn't even tell me.
What should I have told you?
Nobody believes me.
My staff and my colleagues think that I am wrong.
In fact, my close friend, Rakesh.
Even he doesn't believe in me.
I have just met Chotlani.
I asked him what to do now.
He told me..
..That if the matter ends on an resignation, resign.
He told me that nobody will believe..
..That a woman can sexually assault a man.
Now you tell me when nobody is ready to accept it..
..How could I have told you that?
How would I convince you?
How would I make you believe?
You wouldn't have to make me believe.
I would have accepted it if you said it.
I know that you cannot do like this.
Raj.
You will not resign. if you resign and stay silent..
..Then people will accept this lie to be the truth.
People will think you to be wrong all through life.
We will fight against this.
For our truth and honour.
