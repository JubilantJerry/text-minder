Hello?
- I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?
- You can't.
- You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
- No, no.
It's impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.
It's very difficult to get in.
I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.
All right.
The battle between State gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?
Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Huh?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
At 6:00:
Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
Go down.
Just... go downst...
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry.
It's just a political witch hunt.
Ace.
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.
No.
Hey, Mr. Clark.
I've been tryin' to reach you.
- You're tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
-
- You know, I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and, uh, if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail... hopefully you'll be comin' out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fuckin' head open again.
'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat lrish prick!
You put my money to sleep!
- Get my money, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, Fatso.
You fuckin' try me.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'?
He's a square guy, for chrissakes.
He's gonna run to the F.B.I.
That prick's been dodging' me for three weeks.
You're tryin' to tell me what to do.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You're outta line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fuckin' balls?
I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together here.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
If you're actin' like this now, can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that license.
If it goes bad for me, it's bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fuckin' license.
I plant my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.
You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
That's taken out of context.
I had no control over that.
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?
- What happened to you?
You lost control.
- I lost control?
Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fuckin' cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you been treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you her tell about your little role in that situation?
No, that's not the fuckin' point.
- The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
- I would appreciate it... if you stay out of my personal life.
- You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?
- Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
- It's none of my business?
A week ago it was.
Now it's none of my business.
When you need me, you need me.
The way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy is gonna run to the F.B.I. now.
Your head's bigger than your casino.
I knew what he wanted.
Nicky wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
Plus, he had stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
They questioned Nicky.
When some guys that didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every one of those newspapers.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over, there.
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Come on, be nice, huh?
And the bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealin' with degenerate animals out here.
But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sittin' on their asses drinking' anisette.
I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fuckin' bosses think it's a fuckin' free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
- Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Everybody's talkin'.
They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
And I mean, that's no good.
You gotta tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Fuckin' bosses;
they're smokin' their Di Nobilis... and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin' suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.
If I want to talk private, I gotta go to a bus stop.
- What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?
- They're complaining'.
Let 'em complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
- Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.
- It's up to you.
They want a fuckin' war?
I'm ready.
All I gotta do is take care of five of those guys.
The rest will fall into place.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me too.
The F.B.I. watched every move he made, but he didn't care.
He just didn't care.
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch 'em right back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I. de-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.
And because of that, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doin' anything.
I got my job on the line, and this guy's havin' the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up, and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.
That's gonna mean something when you go before the commission.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.
All right, well, we'll move on to...
-
- I wanted to hear something about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this guy gonna land, the fairway?
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the Control Board.
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.
And as if things weren't bad enough, in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they bought the suitcases.
Fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple grand.
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but mostly what he did was complain about his trips to Vegas.
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise they're gonna make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fuckin' nickel goes down.
Receipts...
- Hey, oh, wha...
What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
- Again.
- I said, "frickin' head."
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
What happens next?
You can't believe it.
Who would believe that the F.B.I. had a wire in the place... lookin' for some information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked-out God knows when over God knows what.
What's to prevent him with the suitcases that he could take what he wants?
Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
You believe this bullshit?
Sure, he's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together, those fucks.
I'll find out.
If it's Green, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
- I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.
- Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beatin' me left and right.
- Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm all upset.
- I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doin'.
I can't take this no more.
Back and forth.
- Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
- I know.
I'm too upset.
And the damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas and the casinos and suitcases... and that's it.
Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.
Would you believe that such a thing could happen?
I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.
Every F.B.I. man across the country had their ears open now.
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
I mean, Piscano, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired F.B.I. agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counselor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked...
This commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean, "Adjourned"?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the F.B.I. reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest?
I never comped you?
- I don't comp you at least three times a month?
- I'd like to answer that.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was with Barney Greenstein.
- Was I at that dinner?
Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.
- Was I at that dinner?
Was I?
- You were wandering.
- You were... in the...
You were in the building.
- I was in the building?
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Did you not?
Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
You son of a...
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...
- What are you runnin' for, Bob?
- accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
You promised me when you were getting comped at my hotel.
You were asking me for copies of your bill so you could put 'em on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...
- Bullshit!
Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
But you guys think you have the right to pass judgment!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license... yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fuckin' hypocrites!
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.
What's he doin'?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
What are we gonna do?
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.
[ R. Strauss, "Also Sprach Zarathustra" ]
Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new Sports Book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America;
a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
Mr. Sam Rothstein.
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.
We're very happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy, who is... a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
- Keep an eye on him.
- I've got a large family.
- How many kids do you have?
- I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, please.
Please.
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
- Ace, don't do it. - [ Rimsky-Korsakov, "Flight Of The Bumblebee" ]
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jesus.
He's juggling!
Let's not take Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fuckin' mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
We're on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States.
These guys don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
How can I walk away?
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
He pissed 'em off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for awhile.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain't sending' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break... it would give everybody time to maneuver.
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.
I can't do that.
As soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
Great.
You know, I've got to do some shopping.
You want to go?
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
So on routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, I got a sprained fuckin' elbow.
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards down the road.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit.
I saw something.
Something very cute.
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of comin' back alive... from a meetin' with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people behind my back, goin' over my head?
- What people?
- What people?
What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about.
You said I'm bringin' heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of your shit?
You're ordering' me out?
You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?
- Yeah.
Let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass.
It's not yours.
It's my ass.
I don't know whether you know you have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!
And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You understand.
You could have had the food-and-beverage job without goin' on television!
You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
That's right.
You're makin' a spectacle of yourself.
Me?
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
Every time I meet somebody, the question is:
Do I know you?
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.
- No, Nicky.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
Do you remember?
- Back up a fuckin' minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally...
Every fuckin' wise guy still around will take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fuckin' warned.
Don't go over my head again, you motherfucker, you!
Crack that whip
- Give the past the slip
- Well, we got company.
Step on a crack
Break your mama's back
When a problem comes along you must whip it
Before the preacher talks too long
- You must whip it
- Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he's actin' like he don't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
To Abraham Lincoln.
- Don't let it bother you.
- Does it look like it's botherin' me?
Why do I give a fuck?
That prick.
He won't even look over.
What's his fuckin' problem?
- Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're havin' a good time.
- So are we.
- Whip it good
Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.
- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
- He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000.
I said 50!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take but don't give back.
I ain't got a home I got a phone
How the fuck can you grin?
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
You give a fuck?
Do you?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fuckin' mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
Sherbert send you to rob me now?
Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick all night?
Been beating the customers?
Huh, jag-off?
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
That's it.
Keep lookin' at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep lookin' at him for?
You fuckin'...
Look at this, 20 fuckin' paints in a row.
Hit me again.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
Give me the fuckin' money.
- I'm gonna okay you ten.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
Ten and that's it.
What are you starin' at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on, come on.
Let's get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin'.
Deal.
Everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 11:00 in the morning 'til 1:00 in the afternoon.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Comin' right back to me...
- or finding' some other excuse to come...
- We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things, and I could leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look-Look in my eyes.
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life... a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.
- Beverly Hotel.
- Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.
My daughter is with them, and I think they're gonna try and kidnap her.
- ls there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.
We got a number and an address.
- Hello. ls this Lester?
- Hello.
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
- I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn't.
You shouldn't do this.
-
- You understand?
Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
So...
listen...
Can I call you back?
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.
- Okay, I'll call you right back.
- Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
You want to get back at this prick?
Hmm?
Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?
Hey, you got a minute?
He's got two million in the box, am I right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.
Huh?
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man."
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
You're the mother.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth.
You know where she gets this?
You shut up.
You want me to come over there?
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
- Lester, he called you here.
He called you right here.
- That's who was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here, probably right now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.
What do you think we're gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
- This is fuckin' bullshit!
This is bullshit!
- Get your bag!
Let's go!
- Oh, what bullshit?
What?
You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin'?
- Go, go!
Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
- I think he's gonna kill me.
- Just relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'm gonna call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you're gonna be there, right?
- I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay?
You all right?
Okay.
Bye.
- Just knock it off.
You two knock it off.
- She started it.
- She started the whole thing.
I'm just standing here.
- Get in the car.
You're not gonna drive.
Don't even think you're gonna drive.
I'm gonna drive.
- I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
And I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we...
You can go your own way
Go your own way
Tell me why
- Everything turned around
- Ginger called me.
-
- Yeah.
- I just told you she called me.
- What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
- She's with that cocksucker.
They got Amy.
- That's why I'm here.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
- They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
- I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
I mean, this is family.
It ain't business.
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
You know what I mean?
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
- Driving me fuckin' crazy.
- I think if you, uh... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fuckin' crazy.
Once you get her here, you think about it.
Wait 'til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
Huh?
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane, any plane, to get her here right away.
- That's all I'm asking.
- Do you...
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is...
Do you think if I came back...
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where's the box?
- I gotta tell ya...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
- What's it under?
- Pretty serious.
- How serious?
- It's under 25.
- It's under 25,000?
- Yeah.
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his 25.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch too.
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Good evening, signora.
This way.
- Geno.
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear thousand-dollar suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
- I'm confessin'
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice...
He doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.
at the most, which is impossible, for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, 1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
I've been told before, "We're working it out."
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?
So, counting the watch, let's say another 4,000... for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're lookin' at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed, huh?
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fuckin' actress.
You can fuckin' get that pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you would have ran away, he would have been fuckin' dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
Dreamin' dreams of you Little babe
No, it isn't right.
It isn't fair.
Yes.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fuckin' deal?
I go...
Listen, I just can't fuckin' take it.
Why should I fuckin' take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fuckin' past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
Yes, I want him killed.
I've fuckin' had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
- Hello.
- Yes, I do!
I fuckin' hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
- Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fuckin' guts!
- You hate my guts?
- I'm sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!
Come with me now.
Come with me now.
-
- I want you out.
I want you out of here.
-
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
- You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.
I need some cash right now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
- You're lower than a dog!
- Fuck you!
Here!
Here!
ls this enough money?
Will it last you two fuckin' days?
Take it!
- Greedy bitch.
Take the fuckin' money.
- I'm going to the bank...
- and I'm getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a.m.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
Fine!
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not taking Amy.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
- I am not!
She's my daughter too!
- Get out of here!
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fuckin'-damn you!
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!
Fucker!
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
And later, I realized I didn't want to give her the money... because if I did, I knew I'd never see her again.
- Oh.
Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, angel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it.
It's none of my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
- I was just...
- What?
What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewelry out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust, you know?
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there too.
He's so fuckin' lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
- Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
- No, he wouldn't.
I would have.
- He'd have been right too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
- You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
- I didn't.
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
- You did.
You're right.
You did.
I like that.
- Exactly what you said.
- That's what I like about you.
You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.
And now that it's all over
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
- Changed.
- Changed.
- He did.
He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on.
You're a toughie.
You can take this.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help.
I do.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- ls that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
- I'll take care of you.
Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Thank you.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
- It's what you want?
Yes, it came from your pen, dear, but not from your heart
-
- The third king The joke of the deck
You ended your letter enclosed "Please sign my check"
- That's Ace's wife.
- Why, you fool
- You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool
- Fantastic.
If you think that money can pay for the hard years I've suffered
'Til things broke your way
- This is great for the boss.
- I'm answering your last letter that says we must part
I'm tearing up the pieces the way you tore up my heart
I smile when you kiss me and I thrill at your touch
My only sin was I loved you much too much
Win a little
Lose a little
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You didn't answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do this thing.
I know that you want me to, but it's just...
I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.
I got your cigarettes.
Oscar wants you to call him.
- So who'd you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.
- Where'd you go?
- To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Okay.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
I knew she fucked around.
She did what she did, and I did what I had to do... but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
What?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up gettin' killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up gettin' killed too.
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
- He's good.
He's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.
One night he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would have decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix...
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
- Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!
The cops shot Blue... because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
- What do you want?
It's pitch black.
- Pitch black!
- It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin' moron!
- I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!
To get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and they started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...
- Shit, he's covering up again.
- because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out from a teller who owed him money.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah?
What'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothin'.
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
Nah, you would have heard something.
- What's to stop him?
- I know, I know.
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a fuckin' war or something.
I'm not sure yet, but you know what I want you to do?
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?
That ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do?
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let them show you where it's at.
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
- They'll do it.
- When I'm ready, I'll say the word.
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.
Just let me know.
But you got to be ready.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
There or in the fuckin' bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.
Hey, hey, hey That's what I say

- Me.
- Yeah.
You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I gotta find her.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
She's there with you?
- Yeah, she's here.
- I'll be right over.
Uh, all right.
- Comin' over.
- Great.
Ace, listen, don't make a scene, all right?
- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn't know who to turn to.
She didn't know where to turn.
She's trying to save your marriage.
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
- Hey.
Be fuckin' nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
I'll throw off my sorrow
- Hi, Sam.

You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It was just for a little while, Sam.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.

Listen carefully.

You hear me?
Pure and fuckin' simple.
- Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
- I'll fuckin' kill you.
- You fuckin' whore.
- I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
- You want your jewelry?
- I want you to let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig?
Let you disgrace me?
Get up and be a mother.

Calm down.
Shh.
Hide her car in the back.
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
What did I tell you?
Supposin' he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me what you said.
- Me?
I said nothing.
I said, "No, no, no." Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."
If it's so fucking dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?
Motherfucker.
- I knew this.

You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money?
Are you out of your mind?

Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
- All right.
- I'm going to the F. B.I.!
I'm not scared anymore!
- All right.
Be careful.
- You've fucked with me for the last time!
Okay.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
- Can you believe that?
- Look at this motherfucker.
Whew.
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fuckin' broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.
You know that?
A bad fuckin' spot.
I'd already left the kid with neighbors... and I had about a million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put it in the hotel safe, then I want you to come right back.
She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...
Wait there for me.
Get out here and talk to me!
You fuckin' ignore me, you motherfucker!
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it!
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
I'm going to drive your fucking car through the living room!
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
- Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
- Will you stop it?
- You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
- I am not!
- You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.
- Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
I am!
He's my new sponsor!
How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Hey.
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore!
I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I will go to the police!
- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein...
Shh.
He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry.
We've been getting some complaints about the noise.
- I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
- I understand.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.
- I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?
- Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get a few of my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
How about if we just let her in the house to get a few things?
- This is half her house anyway.
- I'm afraid to let her in the house.
- You aren't afraid, you fucker!
- I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Fucker!
Fucker!
Hold on!
Hey!
Please!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
- It'll make it easier...
- If we let her get her things...
- we'll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house...
- I am calm!
- If she calms down...
I will let her in the house for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens to not want to leave.
- Can I go in?
Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to me.
He's locked up most of my important stuff.
All my papers and things...
I have to get them.
So don't let him come up here.
I know they're in here in the desk...
Fuck.
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.
Are you watching for him?
Got 'em.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it'll just be a couple...
We got other things to do too.
I'll hurry her up.
- How's everything else besides this?
- Fine.
Fine.
- How's your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
- Oh, good.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
We're kind of happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing and then we can go.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shit!
God!
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.
And it would be great... if you guys could just follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
I just need to pick up a little cash inside.
Could you come with me?
- Charlie, you've got to stop her.
You've got to stop her.
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What can I do?
- She's a fuckin' junkie.
She's out of her fucking mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
- Oh!
- There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Half...
I'm coming down.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag.
If you could just ask the guy for the big bag.
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.
- Lady, I can't take it.
- No, you can, you can.
You've been so nice to me.
Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can...
Oh, God, it's him.
You have to stop him.
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.
Mr. Roth...
Mr. Roth...
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
Hey.
She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
- There's nothing we can do.
She had the keys.
- She's on the account.
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
- We're placing you under arrest for...
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- But I'm just trying to leave.
After all the threats and all the bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
- But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
- But it was mine.
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn't do anything.
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.!
We have a warrant!
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...
Paradise.
We managed to really fuck it all up.
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.
F.B.I. We have a federal search warrant.
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- My name is Mark Casper.
Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?
- Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.
You can make a phone call, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
- They got almost everybody else.
- This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.
Put every box on the table.
Ah, yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
Green?
Don't even ask.
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn't.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'm willing to tell you whatever you want to know.
- I've got nothing to hide here.
- Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
- Oh, this is good.
Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Look at this.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.
- What a fuckin' balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?
- Take it easy.
- Wait!
- Wait a minute!
He's sick!
Oh, God!
- Move back.
- I think it's his heart!
Oh, God!
ls he breathing?
- C.P.R. now!
Poor Artie.
He got so upset, he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- Artie!
No, I won't calm down!
- He's my husband!
Artie!
Artie!
- We can't help him if...
And at the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that?
But I didn't want to look at them.
I didn't want to look at the guys who brought them either.
Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
When the bosses were arrested, some of them were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set.
- We're going to take a recess.
- When it looked like they could get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming' a casino... sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the courthouse.
See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fuckin' Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
Remo, what do you think?
Look... why take a chance?
At least, that's the way I feel about it.
Call Artie.
Tell him, I don't care what...
- he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with that guy...
As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
He thought nobody would find him there.
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So, naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you goin', jag-off?
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked.
Oh, no!
No!
No!
[ "House Of The Rising Sun" Continues ]
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels.
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was 3,600 in mint condition coins.
No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
Hey, Nicky.
And so did the powers that be.
- How are you?
- How you doin'?
It took months for everything to calm down.
But, finally, my guys got out on bail... and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin' dollars.
I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
I mean, what's right is right.
They don't give a fuck about...
Holy fuckin'!
What the fuck...
Come on, motherfucker!
-
- Tough guys!
You and your fuckin' brother!
-
- You fuckin' scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
- Frankie!
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker!
Piece of shit!
No, no, no, no!
Take this motherfucker out!
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
All right.
Strip him.
No balls.
You got no fuckin' balls.
Ah, Dominick.
Ah, Dom.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Oh, Dominick.
Come on, come on.
- Bury them?
- Bury them.
The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
-
- They buried them while they were still breathing.
Mister, you all right?
Watch out!
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.
They had other ideas for me.
We need some help over here!
You sure are lucky, mister.
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
And while the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checkin' into an airport.
And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the Pyramids?
Junk bonds.
Still not sure?
Probable.
Maybe questionable.
Let me know as soon as you can find out.
But in the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that.
When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.
There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.
Otherwise, what's the point?
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.
Before I ever ran a casino, or got myself blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I could change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I'm serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money... $62,700,000.
I don't know all the details.
Nobody knew all the details, but it should've been perfect.
I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had, Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should've been so sweet too.
But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.
At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you're talking about a half hour or 45 minutes of digging'.
And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fuckin' night.
Who could resist?
Anywhere else in the country I was a bookie, a gambler... always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and I went to work.
...the casino manager.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It's like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comp trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.
That's the truth about Las Vegas.
We're the only winners.
The players don't stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the holy of holies, the count room.
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.
Even I couldn't get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.
They had so much fuckin' money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.
And the best part was that upstairs...
- the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.
I mean, to them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify 5,000.
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.
Were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standin' in front of about two million dollars... to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise...
- the IRS or anybody.
- Verify 200.
Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way.
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra C-note a week... just to watch the door.
It's routine.
Business as usual:
In, out, hello, good-bye.
And that's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walking' out of the casino with a suitcase.
Now that suitcase was goin' straight to one place:
Right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without gettin' themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all... the bosses ever wanted.
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
- Somethin' smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.
The bosses would come from all over the place:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest.
And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City.
I mean, nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking'.
- Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?
Now, these old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly control Las Vegas.
Mama, that man's here again.
Because they control the Teamsters Union.
And that's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.
- Would you put in shrimp?
- I would.
Here you are, gentlemen.
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
- Definitely the most important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.
- That's around 700,000.
- Uh-huh, good.
I know it's a little early for Las Vegas...
But I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry.
As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.
He even played golf with the president.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.
And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... this check for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
He did what he was told.
Now, here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.
He didn't want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money.
He wanted to believe the Teamsters... gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart.
I know full well how much competition we have in this great city.
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money... to come and pick up his own fuckin' check.
And of course it was the bosses' man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the chairman of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.
I understand.
I understand.
Now all they needed was... somebody they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fuckin' place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot at runnin' a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to.
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.
I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The state law says that you can work in a casino... while they're processing your application.
They got a ten-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out?
We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?
They'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
They take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys been workin' there for 30 years, don't have a license.
It's a tough proposition, Andy.
You know if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious, no interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
And that's how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15 years old, and he always made money.
But he didn't bet like you or me.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly.
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.
He had to know everything, this guy.
He'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew... and that's what he'd put his money on.
Even back home, years ago... when we were first hanging' out... he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...
I'll take Columbia for 20.
- If his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the different bounce... you got off the different kinds of wood they used... on college basketball courts, you know?
He'd be workin' on this shit day and night.
There was nothing about a game he was gonna bet that he didn't know.
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that's just the way he was.
But back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck... about whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost...
Cazzo!
All those fuckin' sweeps.
- Unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
I mean, fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fuckin' zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fuckin' Remo everything.
And to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
- Hey!
- Keepin' Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi...
How the hell'd you do it?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
You see?
Never tells me nothin'.
What do we got on for next week?
Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.
Is that all right?
- Okay, you'll come by the house?
- I'll come by.
7:00.
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up?
Okay, Ace?
Hey, Nick.
Vien acca.
- I'll be right out.
- T'aggia parla.
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He's makin' a lot of money for us.
And he's gonna continue making' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there that... without brains.
- Okay?
- All right.
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah.
Want me to take this for you?
So now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around with the golden Jew.
Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.
Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
- They all made money with us.
- They paying'?
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week, like they're supposed to.
- Don't ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don't see any money.
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.
Who's this guy?
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine.
I laid nine.
- It was eight.
Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.
- Eight.
- If he don't know, nobody knows.
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?
'Cause you're a jag-off.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Is this yours?
Your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen.
Why?
No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.
I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen... and shove it up your ass, you fuckin' jag-off.
- Well, I was just offering you the...
- This fuckin' assho...
Look out, Joe.
Look out.
What's that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little fuckin' girl?
What happened to the fuckin' tough guy...
- told my friend to stick it up his fuckin' ass?
Nicky, take it easy.
Nicky, Nicky.
While I was trying to figure out why the guy was saying... what he was saying, Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him... because he'll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
Listen, with me protecting' Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
I mean, that's what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.
# I got $700 #
# Don't you mess with me #
# But you know I'm down #
# Everybody knows I'm down ##
In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the, you know, good old boys.
I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shoveling mule shit.
Ward, you've got to keep a cleaner space.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him, all right?
Won't happen again, Sam.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein.
Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
What's the story?
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
Thank you very much, Senator.
- They passed the laws, they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room.
- I had dozens of politicians and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.
Coming through that place every week.
- Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.
Why not make him happy?
...the Presidential Suite.
For politicians like our State Senator up there, everything was on the house.
These guys won their comp life when they got elected... so, hey, why not take advantage of it.
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It's a whale like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat... that's the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.
Downstairs he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and two million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.
I can't understand it.
These mechanical things, you know they happen.
Hey, but better here than up there, you know what I mean.
Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan.
I can't believe that there's a convention; there's no room.
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
- I'm sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet 1,000 a hand, instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.
...to the bank with a natural lead over a five.
But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa... was that they can't bet small for long.
He didn't think of it as winning 10,000... he thought of it as losing 90,000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all.
# Goddamn it Trying to make it real #
# Compared to what #
# Sock it to me #
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.
Six.
All right, who's gonna give me that?
Since the players are looking to beat the casino...
Each and every roll, all right.
- The dealers are watching the players...
- Six.
- Fake a six.
- The boxmen are watching the dealers.
The floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I'm watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys up there... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
# Tryin' to make it real compared to what #
Yes!
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.
Lookin' good.
Lookin' good.
Let's go.
This is for Ginger.
Come on.
Let me have a hundred on your hard ten.
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice...
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You were great.
Thanks.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
- Come on.
- What's the matter?
What do you mean?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I've seen you stealing from me.
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.
- I want my half.
- I've been watching you all night.
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Get lost!
Get lost?
Get lost?
Yes!
Yes!
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!
# Slippin' and a-slidin' # Changin' and a-hidin' #
# Been told a long time ago #
# I been told Baby, you've been born #
# I won't be your fool no more Oww #
# Baby, oh, baby #
# My sweet baby #
# You're the one #
What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
# What's different about him #
# I don't really know #
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
# No matter how I try #
# I just can't make him cry #
- Ginger's mission in life was money.
- I'll be right back.
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers... and helped them spread around a lot of money.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?
- And you do.
Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
# You only make me glad #
# Better listen, little girl #
# You're goin' walkin' down the street #
# I ain't got no love #
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
# This heart of stone #
- How you doin' tonight?
- Good.
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.
- Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.
And that's what Vegas is all about.
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.
- It's kickback city.
- Have a good night.
Thank you.
You too.
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.
Pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, she took care of the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... because they took care of the security guards...
- who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.
- No problem.
- You are a doll.
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.
But one thing I just could never understand... was that she could have everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Gin, you know I got other people in this, they got partners.
I want you to understand that I am looking out for you... in this thing, okay?
You're gonna get yours back, and you're gonna get back first, okay?
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?
Where are you?
You're in that place.
Where are you?
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
- You're my woman.
- I know.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag.
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.
And somehow she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
If you find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well.
- That's why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.
- Back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.
- Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.
# Volare #
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops.
This time they wanted to pinch him...
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.
- Hold it, hold it.
Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
- And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.
Look at this.
Beautiful!
I mean, that's what worried me. 'Cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
- All right, we're clear.
- There's more.
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What's that?
Huh, what's that?
There's no more.
Thanks, hon.
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn't send me out there to have a good time.
They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?
Hey, Sammy.
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- Incredible.
Welcome to Vegas.
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What've you been doing out here?
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick, they're dear friends of mine.
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you... it's no joke out here, it's no joke.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It's not like back home.
Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us.
And this sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care.
I wanna get away from back home for a while.
I'm tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place, everything's legit.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Ace saw Vegas one way...
- You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
- Of course.
But I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
I mean, they had bookies, pimps... and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started gettin' everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
Yeah, he had a foolproof scheme, all right.
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected;
when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves.
What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin'?
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?
Oh, Nicky.
I thought you was layin'.
No, no, I'm takin'.
I was takin'.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window... you'll get unconfused.
- Gimme the fuckin' money.
- I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't mean anything by it.
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?
- My fuckin' head.
- Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president.
George Washington was born...
But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town... like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
Beautiful, you got a beautiful swing.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved in Little League.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches... was a fuckin' metro intelligence cop.
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.
He's gotta realize that everything can't be a home run that he does.
That's exactly what I keep tellin' him... but that's the kind of kid he is.
And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.
They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fuckin' balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of 200 fuckin' grand...
- yeah, right, I'm sure.
- Hey!
How are you?
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm over here now.
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase and then he left.
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's out?
I think maybe he went across the street... or somewhere else or somethin'.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- Yeah, lots of luck.
- Yeah, good luck to you too.
- Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.
Yeah, they don't need those anymore.
Guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
'Cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble.
Even after we'd catch them, they'd try sneaking back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy, he's betting' lavender chips... at 500 each with only one little problem... he's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they're all greedy.
# I got a feelin' about the future #
# And it ain't too good I know that #
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.
He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Now, here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card... and signaling his buddy at this table.
And that's just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away.
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Jeff #
# Happy birthday to you #
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
They never know what hit them.
And if and when they do find out... that they just got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals... they were knocking this place dead for years.
- He's got a wire on him.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There it is.
That's it.
- Cheater's justice.
- Oh, God!
No, no, no!
I wanted everybody to know... that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks... that the party was over.
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks... with your right hand.
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.
- You can't do it with both hands?
- No, sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I never tried.
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
- It's 100, 110, I think.
- Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hiya.
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don't I take him... over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
And by the way... send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
- Sure will.
- Real special.
- By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
- Hi.
- Having a good time?
- Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice:
You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here.
- What do you want?
- I just wanna get out of here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake.
'Cause if you come back here, and we catch either one of you... we're gonna break your heads, and you won't walk out of here.
You see that fuckin' saw?
We're gonna use it.
You got it?
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.
Throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car.
Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters... the per was way up, the gods were happy.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We're not gettin' any younger.
Don't you think it's time?
Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I'm gonna do you one better.
I'm tryin' to marry you.
You wanna marry me?
I'm serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you.
And I can't think of anybody better to be with.
And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam?
'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, okay.
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.
- All right, all right.
- Understand?
Sam, I'm sorry.
No, I...
I...
I mean...
I can grow.
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.
What is love anyway?
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.
It's a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out, doesn't play out... then what happens to me?
You know I'm doing well now, and I'm gonna do even better.
And so whatever happens... if it doesn't work out between us...
I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.
And if there are kids, especially...
I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What are you pitching me?
Just what I said, you'll be set up... for the rest of your life, that I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories.
But I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town, and he knew they'd show.
Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride, even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby before they could get married.
He even made Jenny and me watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
But I didn't mind, we loved the kid.
Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don't make me come there.
Answer me.
I love you.
But, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
You do?
Yeah, I do.
It's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right, in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.
I'm lookin' at you right now.
I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute.
I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
I'm okay, I just...
You just have to understand.
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
I just...
I don't...
I think I have a right to do that.
Okay?
It's all right.
That part of your life is over with.
- Right?
- Yeah.
You're with me now.
- Yeah.
- Right?
Uh-huh.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Let's go.
Let's go back in.
- Okay.
Oh!
Tsk.
It's great.
It's great.
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can't...
Try it on.
It's yours.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
Nice, isn't it?
No one's ever been so nice to me.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
So, do you think it's too much... if I wear these all on the same day?
You do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
So wonderful.
The jewelry's not so bad either.
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
- What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
- Okay.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this doesn't mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
With over a million in cash and jewels... tucked in a bank in Vegas, only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
So I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank... under the name of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
And since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet... when I needed the money the most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
- # I'll take you there # - # I'm callin', callin' #
# Callin' for mercy #
- # I'll take you there # - # Mercy, mercy #
# I'll take you there #
This is a signature card.
So once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Yeah, sure I do.
Why?
It's good.
It's just unusual.
Tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
- # Let me take you there # - # I'll take you there #
- # Ain't no smiling' faces # - # I'll take you there ##
# Never will I know happiness #
With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
And to play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a license.
I mean Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming his own kind of Vegas.
I put money out on the street charging' three points a week.
- Don't make us come lookin' for you.
- Juice to the fuckin' dealers.
You won't have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
It was so obvious.
- All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics were signal-happy.
- I'm gonna open for 500.
Signaling back and forth.
Why you cryin' with two loaves of bread under your arm?
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.
I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky's a made guy, and I'm not.
I can't do that.
Be careful.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
So I'm lucky.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.
Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place.
A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin' ear...
"This is Las Vegas.
We're supposed to be out here robbin'... you dumb fuckin' hebe. "
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.
Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table.
What's he think this is, a goddamned sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table?
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Call security.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
Wanna do me a favor?
Take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on.
Fuck you!
I want you to exit this guy off the premises... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain't goin' anywhere with you.
- Bullshit.
You're outta here.
- Fuck you!
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Leave me alone!
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?
- Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
Come here.
Come here.
You go over there.
You apologize.
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get outta line again, I'll smash your head so hard... you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fuckin' hick.
Sammy, listen.
This guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.
I mean, he's already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...
I swear he'll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he's out for good.
I don't care what it is, I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this, really.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kickin', stinky-horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in the desert.
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I'm sorry.
# You're dear to me Yes, sirree #
You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David and their tigers away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a Rolls-Royce.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fuckin' angles.
He brought over the whole "Femme Fatale" show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like balloons.
She's still eight pounds over.
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.
Never mind the "sir. " Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them...
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I guess she's frightened.
If she doesn't lose weight she may get fired.
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris...
- It's been our policy...
- Just stop everything!
- This woman's an institution.
- That's the problem.
She's lazy.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So, he took bookie joints off the street... and then opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years by doing all of this... he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off of him.
Between my innovations...
# Look like they're taking some cat to jail # and Nicky's dedication to his job...
# Steamboats are comin' and they're splashing and goin' #
I soon had the best operation on the strip.
# Moon is shinin' on friends below #
You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why?
Somebody's complaining'?
I'm hearing things from security.
The sheriff's lookin' to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
They got two names from the whole country... and one of 'em is still Al Capone.
If they put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.
You will not be able to walk into a casino.
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.
I'm just tellin' you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
All right.
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
Back home, they would've put me in jail for what I'm doing.
But out here, they're giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... for charitable donations to greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife, Ginger, work the room.
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.
We'd love to have you there.
- Yes, okay.
- Great.
She made everybody feel good.
# That's Stella by starlight #
Congratulations, Sam.
Oh, thanks.
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
- Hi.
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fuckin' kid!
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!
They didn't know what really moved her.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Daddy gave me this...
And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin' back there?
You can't even see 'em there.
- Okay, I'll...
- What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
- Well...
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.
- The action is in the front.
Bring 'em up front.
- All right, I will.
Listen to me very carefully.
There are three ways of doing things around here:
The right way, the wrong way and the way that I do it.
- You understand?
- I do understand that.
I'll get right on it.
- And thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Just do it.
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right, Mr. Rothstein.
I am so sorry.
So I ended up working...
what, 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get something out of it.
Well, it wasn't long... before what I was afraid was gonna happen happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas.
And from then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"He will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000... every time he shows up. "
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it.
You got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation... "
Motherfucker!
Is there any way around this?
No, there's no way.
Let's say, for instance...
I wanna go in a restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can't even set foot in the parking lot.
That's how serious it is.
In other words, I'm fucked?
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.
I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.
They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
So, once they pulled that shit...
I started doin' my own things nobody ever thought of doin'.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados... and started knocking' over high-rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers...
anybody right here in town.
I had a good fuckin' crew goin' for me, I'll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy.
He worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
And I opened up my own jewelry store too, the "Gold Rush. "
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.
But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off looking at me... so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
- What's takin' so long?
- This is a motherfucker!
- It's working.
- Learn how to open these things so you don't have to take 'em.
Some of these stones got a lot of niggers in them.
Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he better take a camel back to Nigeria.
Yeah?
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
- All right.
Thanks.
He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen.
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.
- Valet parkers.
- They're just checking in now.
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.
- 1230.
Right.
- Secretaries.
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition?
All right.
And they all got a piece of the score.
Car's coming.
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else... if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
What the fuck they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?
You know, this diamond has flaws in it.
- There's no flaws.
- I'm doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws.
Whenever we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
What, are you gonna have a fucking meeting here?
I know his language.
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.
Twenty thousand.
That's my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk Turkey here.
Twenty-five thousand.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault... where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush... in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.
She used to fall asleep on the couch watching TV.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't even supposed to be doin' it.
The bosses were making so much fucking money with the casinos... that they didn't want anybody making' any waves for them.
You gave all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?
That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came here.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet?
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.
You will try to push it through, won't you, Mr. Clark?
- Yes.
- I'm giving you 50,000 cash.
Then I put some more money into legitimate places, like my restaurant.
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Fuckers.
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.
Enjoy.
Have a good time.
Choke on it, motherfucker.
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin'?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with it.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over the place.
That show over at the Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said, whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls, naturally.
I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star.
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.
- Hey, Shelly.
How are you?
- Hi.
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.
- This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
Come on.
I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days.
It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?
You know you're a lyin' lowlife, motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
Your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off.
And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money?
- No?
You didn't?
- I didn't...
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck outta me.
You wanna embarrass me and make a fool outta me?
You didn't gamble?
Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money...
I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on!
Did you gamble?
Huh?
Fuckin' degenerate.
Fuckin' kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck outta here.
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.
Let me find out you fucked up.
I'll leave you where I find you.
How many of these you gonna eat?
- Two.
- Two?
But around 6:30 in the morning, when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?
- Not a lot.
You know why, right?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- 'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.
Every couple of weeks, I used to send Marino... back to the bosses with a piece of what I made.
Not a bit piece, but what did they know?
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do...
I would carry things out to a "T."
Like the time Tony Dogs, who's supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo's bars.
Here's a fuckin' guy kills two of Remo's guys... and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just workin' on her night off, of all things.
I mean, this guy's just beggin' to be made an example of.
Frankie, I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
And I don't care what you have to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?
- I'll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow 'em down.
To be truthful with you, I had to admire this guy.
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.
This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two fuckin' nights we beat the shit outta this guy.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
- Better give me a name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.
- But he never talked.
- I know you would've ratted by now.
In the end, I had to put his fuckin' head in a vise.
Dogs, Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.
I'll squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.
Don't make me have to do this.
Please.
Come on!
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Come on.
Fuck you!
This motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fuckin' days and nights.
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're tellin' me?
You motherfucker, you!
Huh?
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M.
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.
You make me pop your fuckin' eye outta your head... to protect that piece of shit, Charlie M.?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!
You motherfucker, you!
Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
The word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
Charlie M.
Four reels, sevens, across three $15,000 jackpots.
Do you have any idea what the odds are?
It's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn't you call me?
It happened so quick.
Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.
- You didn't see the scam?
- There's no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
They won!
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.
What's the matter with you?
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
I think you're overreacting.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel.
I've been carrying your ass ever since I got here.
- Get your ass outta here.
- You're firing me?
I'm firing you.
No, I'm not firing...
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.
This is not the way to treat people.
If you didn't know, you're too fuckin' dumb.
If you did know, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.
Get out.
Come on.
Let's go.
The guy's history as far as I'm concerned.
But you can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a commissioner.
This is his state.
His uncle's chief judge.
His brother-in-law runs the county commission.
You're in the finances, you're upstairs.
But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.
I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.
There is not one single thing I will not catch.
- Look at yours.
Look at that.
- Huh?
Look at this.
There's nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
What are you talking about?
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
- Where are you going?
- # How long can this go on #
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
- What do you need?
- Got her?
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don't you take it out of your account?
I would, you know, Sam, it's just that...
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?
What's the difference?
I just need it.
Well, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.
You're not asking for a box of popcorn.
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.
Okay?
We don't have to have a fight.
It's important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.
Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.
Why can't you tell me what it's for?
Huh?
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for 25,000.
What do you want, a coat?
- No.
- If you want a coat, you got it.
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
Sam, I've been independent my whole life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
- Now you're making me beg.
- What are you talking about?
And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?
You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
You know, it's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
Can I trust you?
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you could tell me what the money is for.
# You've got to #
# Give a little #
# Take a little #
# And let your poor heart #
# Break a little #
Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.
All right, I'm gonna follow her.
What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
It means I got the money.
# You've got to #
- # Give a little #
- Yes, you're way up on top now.
# Take a little ##
How are you doin', Les?
It's Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
If I'm wrong, please correct me.
'Cause I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine too.
Go ahead.
Take it.
'Cause you already have hers.
She's my wife.
Look at me.
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew that she's my wife?
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah, I know that.
You know, yeah?
But if you ever come back again, ever... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man.
Don't be a fucking pimp.
Now, you wanna do me a favor?
Get outta here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get up and get outta here.
- And you want to be free.
- # Take a little #
Why, you feel that you are too good... much too good for a nobody like me.
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- That's fuckin' bullshit.
- # That's the story #
- Well, darling, I guess it's best...
- # That's the glory of love # - that we should part.
Remember when you called him that night and said good-bye?
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down. "
- He didn't say that to you, did he?
- No, he didn't.
No.
Instead, what did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got. "
Come here.
I want to show you something.
- # That's the story #
- The second letter came right after I gave you your start.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Make 'em stop it!
No!
No!
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!
No!
- Fuck!
Fuck!
- Piece of shit.
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He's such a prick!
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn't want to do it himself.
Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands dirty.
So why did he have to do that, huh?
Tell me.
- I know it wasn't a nice thing to do...
- No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down...
No.
No.
I told him all about this guy before we ever got married.
- This is no fucking surprise.
- Oh, you did?
I didn't know that.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
You know, the first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open, you know.
I knew the bottom could drop out at any time.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this... if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?
So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.
You mean like a lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I'm just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?
A million dollars in jewelry.
Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you?
I should've never married him.
He's a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.
I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
You know, this is probably not...
I don't have the answers anyway.
- This is probably not what you want to hear...
- I do.
'Cause you're a little upset, and I understand that.
But I think you should try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could've killed him!
Okay?
He could've killed him.
He didn't have to hit him.
It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What is that all about?
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl.
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this.
You're so nice.
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.
- # These eyes before us #
- Thanks.
# Just what the truth is #
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
# I can't say anymore #
# 'Cause I love you #
# Yes, I love you... ##
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?
Uh, no.
No, thank you, little lady.
Okay, send him in.
Then call me four minutes after.
- Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
- How do you do?
- Hey, it is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well.
Hey, all that money is rollin' in.
I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor civil servant.
- Why don't you have a seat, hmm?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I come here personally to kind of smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
See, uh, maybe you didn't know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends.
Nice family and their money go back many, many years.
Now friends vote.
Family and money votes.
That's important to me and you.
And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you'll forgive me for sayin' it... maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
That means, either he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was goin' on.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Are, uh...
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.
What you're saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be very helpful to that kid.
He's weak.
He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.
There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favor... if you'd think some more on hiring' him back.
I can't do that.
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law... and I do want to help you and I like to do favors.
I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.
He's too incompetent, and the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Okay.
Thanks.
Well... you know, that's it.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests.
But you act like you're at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.
But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the governor.
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- You bet.
What happened to my pills?
Huh?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinking too much?
You're taking my pills too?
I didn't take your pills.
Look, for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these.
And that's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with 'em?
You didn't have to beat him up.
What?
I was just trying to help him.
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring about people.
What?
What?
I said, you can't make me... stop caring about people.
Listen...
Ginger...
I'm trying to make the best of everything here, you know?
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.
I mean, people look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit!
I'm gettin' out of here.
I am.
Come over here.
You gotta get hold of yourself.
- Okay.
Okay.
- If not for me, at least for Amy.
Understand?
Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand.
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.
That's all you care about.
You don't care about me.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that fuckin' leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Okay?
You'll do it.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Okay.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
I will.
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rollin' in... and the suitcases kept comin' and goin'.
And let me tell you, the fuckin' bottom line here is... cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin' a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Huh?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
Even John Nash...
that's the guy who ran the scam... he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the purpose.
Huh?
They take this money because they're my guys, so give 'em some leeway.
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
- What were you doin'?
- I was with my cumma.
- What are you doin' with your cumma?
- I gave her a scheff.
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
- What you been doin'?
- I'm out there more than I'm here.
And little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they'd would've been better off makin' fuckin' novena.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
- I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
- What expenses?
I'm layin' money outta my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping' records.
No records, Artie.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I keep laying' out my own fuckin' dough.
What the hell are we doin' over here?
You're goin' to Las Vegas at my expense.
Oh, fuck.
I mean, after all...
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next.
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- We made a deal.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr. Integrity... had a partner nobody knew about.
And when she showed up and started demanding money...
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're wrong.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.
Green tried to stonewall her.
I will see to it that you do not get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its president, Phil Green.
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
Hey, that's not good.
She was doin' pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start countin' her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
Can you comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
- What are you talking about?
- She was found last night shot in the head.
Was this just a real estate partnership?
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
Did you ever hear of the. 22 Caliber Killer?
Now, instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with real estate deals.
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
Hmm, have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties... says that he is the real boss of the $100 million...
Tangiers casino empire. "
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.
Has that man even filed for his license yet?
I don't know.
We have to check the files.
Without gettin' your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And kinda check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass outta town.
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation... of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein's application... for a gaming license is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino...
Hello?
- I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?
- You can't.
- You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
- No, no.
It's impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.
It's very difficult to get in.
I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.
All right.
The battle between State gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?
- Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Huh?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
At 6:00:
Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
Go down.
Just... go downst-
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry.
It's just a political witch hunt.
Ace.
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.
No.
Hey, Mr. Clark.
I've been tryin' to reach you.
- You're tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
- You know, I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and, uh, if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail... hopefully you'll be comin' out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fuckin' head open again.
'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat Irish prick!
You put my money to sleep!
- Get my money, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, Fatso.
You fuckin' try me.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'?
He's a square guy, for chrissakes.
He's gonna run to the F.B.I.
That prick's been dodging' me for three weeks.
You're tryin' to tell me what to do.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You're outta line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fuckin' balls?
I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together here.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
If you're actin' like this now, can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that license.
If it goes bad for me, it's bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fuckin' license.
I plant my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.
You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
That's taken out of context.
I had no control over that.
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?
- What happened to you?
You lost control.
- I lost control?
Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fuckin' cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you been treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you her tell about your little role in that situation?
No, that's not the fuckin' point.
- The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
- I would appreciate it... if you stay out of my personal life.
- You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?
- Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
- It's none of my business?
A week ago it was.
Now it's none of my business.
When you need me, you need me.
The way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy is gonna run to the F.B.I. Now.
Your head's bigger than your casino.
I knew what he wanted.
Nicky wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
Plus, he had stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
They questioned Nicky.
When some guys that didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every one of those newspapers.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over, there.
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Come on, be nice, huh?
And the bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealin' with degenerate animals out here.
But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sittin' on their asses drinking' anisette.
I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fuckin' bosses think it's a fuckin' free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
- Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Everybody's talkin'.
They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
And I mean, that's no good.
You gotta tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Fuckin' bosses;
they're smokin' their Di Nobilis... and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin' suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.
If I want to talk private, I gotta go to a bus stop.
- What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?
- They're complaining'.
Let 'em complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
- Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.
- It's up to you.
They want a fuckin' war?
I'm ready.
All I gotta do is take care of five of those guys.
The rest will fall into place.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me too.
The F.B.I. Watched every move he made, but he didn't care.
He just didn't care.
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch 'em right back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I. De-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.
And because of that, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doin' anything.
I got my job on the line, and this guy's havin' the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up, and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.
That's gonna mean something when you go before the commission.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.
All right, well, we'll move on to...
- I wanted to hear something about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this guy gonna land, the fairway?
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the Control Board.
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.
And as if things weren't bad enough, in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they bought the suitcases.
Fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple grand.
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but mostly what he did was complain about his trips to Vegas.
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise they're gonna make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fuckin' nickel goes down.
Receipts...
- Hey, oh, wha...
What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
- Again.
- I said, "frickin' head. "
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
What happens next?
You can't believe it.
Who would believe that the F.B.I. Had a wire in the place... lookin' for some information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked-out God knows when over God knows what.
What's to prevent him with the suitcases that he could take what he wants?
Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
You believe this bullshit?
Sure, he's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together, those fucks.
I'll find out.
If it's Green, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
- I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.
- Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beatin' me left and right.
- Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm all upset.
- I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doin'.
I can't take this no more.
Back and forth.
- Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
- I know.
I'm too upset.
And the damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas and the casinos and suitcases... and that's it.
Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.
Would you believe that such a thing could happen?
I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.
Every F.B.I. Man across the country had their ears open now.
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
I mean, Piscano, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired F.B.I. Agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counselor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked...
This commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean, "Adjourned"?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the F.B.I. Reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest?
I never comped you?
- I don't comp you at least three times a month?
- I'd like to answer that.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was with Barney Greenstein.
- Was I at that dinner?
Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.
- Was I at that dinner?
Was I?
- You were wandering.
- You were... in the...
You were in the building.
- I was in the building?
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Did you not?
Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
You son of a...
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...
- What are you runnin' for, Bob?
- Accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
You promised me when you were getting comped at my hotel.
You were asking me for copies of your bill so you could put 'em on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...
- Bullshit!
Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
But you guys think you have the right to pass judgment!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license... yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fuckin' hypocrites!
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.
What's he doin'?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
What are we gonna do?
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.
Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new Sports Book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America;
a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
Mr. Sam Rothstein.
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.
We're very happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy, who is... a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
- Keep an eye on him.
- I've got a large family.
- How many kids do you have?
- I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, please.
Please.
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
- Ace, don't do it.
- ##
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jesus.
He's juggling!
Let's not take Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fuckin' mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
We're on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States.
These guys don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
How can I walk away?
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
He pissed 'em off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for awhile.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain't sending' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break... it would give everybody time to maneuver.
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.
I can't do that.
As soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
Great.
You know, I've got to do some shopping.
You want to go?
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
So on routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, I got a sprained fuckin' elbow.
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards down the road.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit.
I saw something.
Something very cute.
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of comin' back alive... from a meetin' with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people behind my back, goin' over my head?
- What people?
- What people?
What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about.
You said I'm bringin' heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of your shit?
You're ordering' me out?
You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?
- Yeah.
Let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass.
It's not yours.
It's my ass.
I don't know whether you know you have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!
And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You understand.
You could have had the food-and-beverage job without goin' on television!
You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
That's right.
You're makin' a spectacle of yourself.
Me?
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
Every time I meet somebody, the question is:
Do I know you?
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.
- No, Nicky.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
Do you remember?
- Back up a fuckin' minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally...
Every fuckin' wise guy still around will take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fuckin' warned.
Don't go over my head again, you motherfucker, you!
# Crack that whip #
- # Give the past the slip #
- Well, we got company.
# Step on a crack #
# Break your mama's back #
# When a problem comes along you must whip it #
# Before the preacher talks too long #
- # You must whip it #
- Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he's actin' like he don't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
To Abraham Lincoln.
- Don't let it bother you.
- Does it look like it's botherin' me?
Why do I give a fuck?
That prick.
He won't even look over.
What's his fuckin' problem?
- Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're havin' a good time.
- So are we.
- # Whip it good ##
Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.
- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
- He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000.
I said 50!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take but don't give back.
# I ain't got a home I got a phone ##
How the fuck can you grin?
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
You give a fuck?
Do you?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fuckin' mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
Sherbert send you to rob me now?
Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick all night?
Been beating the customers?
Huh, jag-off?
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
That's it.
Keep lookin' at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep lookin' at him for?
You fuckin'...
Look at this, 20 fuckin' paints in a row.
Hit me again.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
Give me the fuckin' money.
- I'm gonna okay you ten.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
Ten and that's it.
What are you starin' at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on, come on.
Let's get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin'.
Deal.
Everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 11:00 in the morning 'til 1:00 in the afternoon.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Comin' right back to me...
- or finding' some other excuse to come...
- We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things, and I could leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look-Look in my eyes.
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life... a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
- Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.
- Beverly Hotel.
- Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.
My daughter is with them, and I think they're gonna try and kidnap her.
- Is there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.
We got a number and an address.
- Hello.
Is this Lester?
- Hello.
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
- I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn't.
You shouldn't do this.
- You understand?
Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
So...
listen...
Can I call you back?
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.
- Okay, I'll call you right back.
- Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
You want to get back at this prick?
Hmm?
- Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?
Hey, you got a minute?
He's got two million in the box, am I right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.
Huh?
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man. "
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
You're the mother.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth.
You know where she gets this?
- You shut up.
You want me to come over there?
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
- Lester, he called you here.
He called you right here.
- That's who was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here, probably right now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.
What do you think we're gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
- This is fuckin' bullshit!
This is bullshit!
- Get your bag!
Let's go!
- Oh, what bullshit?
What?
You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin'?
- Go, go!
Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
I think he's gonna kill me.
- Just relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'm gonna call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you're gonna be there, right?
- I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay?
You all right?
Okay.
Bye.
- Just knock it off.
You two knock it off.
- She started it.
- She started the whole thing.
I'm just standing here.
- Get in the car.
You're not gonna drive.
Don't even think you're gonna drive.
I'm gonna drive.
- I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
And I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we...
# You can go your own way #
# Go your own way #
# Tell me why #
- # Everything turned around #
- Ginger called me.
Yeah.
- I just told you she called me.
- What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
- She's with that cocksucker.
They got Amy.
- That's why I'm here.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
- They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
- I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
I mean, this is family.
It ain't business.
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
You know what I mean?
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
- Driving me fuckin' crazy.
- I think if you, uh... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fuckin' crazy.
Once you get her here, you think about it.
Wait 'til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
Huh?
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane, any plane, to get her here right away.
- That's all I'm asking.
- Do you...
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is...
Do you think if I came back...
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where's the box?
- I gotta tell ya...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
- What's it under?
- Pretty serious.
- How serious?
- It's under 25.
- It's under 25,000?
- Yeah.
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his 25.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch too.
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Good evening, signora.
This way.
- Geno.
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear thousand-dollar suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
- # I'm confessin' #
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice...
He doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible, for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, 1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
I've been told before, "We're working it out. "
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?
So, counting the watch, let's say another 4,000... for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're lookin' at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed, huh?
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fuckin' actress.
You can fuckin' get that pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you would have ran away, he would have been fuckin' dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
# Dreamin' dreams of you Little babe ##
No, it isn't right.
It isn't fair.
Yes.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fuckin' deal?
I go...
Listen, I just can't fuckin' take it.
Why should I fuckin' take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fuckin' past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
Yes, I want him killed.
I've fuckin' had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
- Hello.
- Yes, I do!
I fuckin' hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
- Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fuckin' guts!
- You hate my guts?
- I'm sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!
Come with me now.
Come with me now.
- I want you out.
I want you out of here.
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
- You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.
I need some cash right now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
- You're lower than a dog!
- Fuck you!
Here!
Here!
Is this enough money?
Will it last you two fuckin' days?
Take it!
- Greedy bitch.
Take the fuckin' money.
- I'm going to the bank...
- and I'm getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a. m.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
Fine!
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not taking Amy.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
- I am not!
She's my daughter too!
- Get out of here!
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fuckin'- damn you!
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!
Fucker!
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
And later, I realized I didn't want to give her the money... because if I did, I knew I'd never see her again.
- Oh.
Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, angel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it.
It's none of my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
- I was just...
- What?
What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewelry out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust, you know?
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there too.
He's so fuckin' lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
- Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
- No, he wouldn't.
I would have.
- He'd have been right too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
- You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
- I didn't.
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
- You did.
You're right.
You did.
I like that.
- Exactly what you said.
- That's what I like about you.
You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.
# And now that it's all over ##
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
- Changed.
- Changed.
- He did.
He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on.
You're a toughie.
You can take this.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help.
I do.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
- I'll take care of you.
Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Thank you.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
- It's what you want?
# Yes, it came from your pen, dear, but not from your heart #
- # The third king The joke of the deck #
# You ended your letter enclosed "Please sign my check" #
- That's Ace's wife.
- # Why, you fool #
- # You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool #
- Fantastic.

- Hi.
- Hi.
- You didn't answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do this thing.
I know that you want me to, but it's just...
I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.
I got your cigarettes.
Oscar wants you to call him.
- So who'd you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.
- Where'd you go?
- To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Okay.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
I knew she fucked around.
She did what she did, and I did what I had to do... but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
What?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up gettin' killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up gettin' killed too.
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
- He's good.
He's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.
One night he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would have decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix...
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
- Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!
The cops shot Blue...
- because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
- What do you want?
It's pitch black.
- Pitch black!
- It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin' moron!
- I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!
To get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and they started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...
- Shit, he's covering up again.
- Because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out from a teller who owed him money.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah?
What'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothin'.
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
Nah, you would have heard something.
- What's to stop him?
- I know, I know.
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a fuckin' war or something.
I'm not sure yet, but you know what I want you to do?
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?
That ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do?
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let them show you where it's at.
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
- They'll do it.
- When I'm ready, I'll say the word.
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.
Just let me know.
But you got to be ready.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
There or in the fuckin' bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.

Nick?
- Me.
- Yeah.
You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I gotta find her.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
She's there with you?
- Yeah, she's here.
- I'll be right over.
Uh, all right.
- Comin' over.
- Great.
Ace, listen, don't make a scene, all right?
- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn't know who to turn to.
She didn't know where to turn.
She's trying to save your marriage.
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
- Hey.
Be fuckin' nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
# I'll throw off my sorrow ##
- Hi, Sam.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It was just for a little while, Sam.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed.
You fuckin' do that again, I'll...
- I was just gonna be out for a little while.
- I should have...
- She was asleep.
I was gonna be right back...
- Listen.
- Before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Listen to me.
- Fuck you.
I was gonna be back...
- Let me tell you something.
- Before she woke up.
- Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again...
I'll fuckin' kill ya, pure and simple.
You hear me?
Pure and fuckin' simple.
- Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
- I'll fuckin' kill you.
- You fuckin' whore.
- I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
- You want your jewelry?
- I want you to let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig?
Let you disgrace me?
Get up and be a mother.
Get in the car and go to the house right now.
Get up and get in the...
Get...
Get up.
Get up!
- Get up.
Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get up!
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get the fuck...
Are you threatening me?
I'll fuckin' kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.
- I'm going!
I'm going!
- You...
- Now you need approval from him to go home?
- So what?
So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in?
- Huh?
- You make me sick, you fuckin'...
- Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
- Oh, fuck you!
- Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
Fuck you!
- # I can't get no satisfaction #

I'll do it.
- Okay.
# No-no-no-no-no satisfaction #
- # No-no-no-no, I can't get me no satisfaction #
- Leave it where it is!
# I can't get no satisfaction ##
Where is he?
Goddamn it, I want that Jew bastard killed!
Calm down.
Shh.
Hide her car in the back.
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
What did I tell you?
Supposin' he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me what you said.
- Me?
I said nothing.
I said, "No, no, no. " Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful. "
If it's so fucking dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?
Motherfucker.
- I knew this.
I knew it.
- What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?
You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money?
Are you out of your mind?
- Look what you did to this fuckin' guy?
- What?
If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut.
What the fuck is the use!
I should've never got involved...
Hey!
Hey!
You motherfucker, you!
Ow!
You fuck!
You fucker!
Get out!
Get the fuck out!
Get out!
Get the fuck out!
- No!
No!
- Get down there!
Take it easy!
I should never have gotten involved with this fucking nut!
You'll fuckin' kill her.
Take it easy.
- Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
- All right.
- I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I'm not scared anymore!
- All right.
Be careful.
- You've fucked with me for the last time!
Okay.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
- Can you believe that?
- Look at this motherfucker.
Whew.
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fuckin' broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.
You know that?
A bad fuckin' spot.
I'd already left the kid with neighbors... and I had about a million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put it in the hotel safe, then I want you to come right back.
- She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...
- Wait there for me.
Get out here and talk to me!
You fuckin' ignore me, you motherfucker!
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it!
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
I'm going to drive your fucking car through the living room!
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
- Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
- Will you stop it?
- You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
- I am not!
- You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.
- Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
I am!
He's my new sponsor!
How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Hey.
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore!
I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I will go to the police!
- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein...
Shh.
He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry.
We've been getting some complaints about the noise.
- I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
- I understand.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.
- I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?
- Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get a few of my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
How about if we just let her in the house to get a few things?
- This is half her house anyway.
- I'm afraid to let her in the house.
You aren't afraid, you fucker!
- I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fucker!
Fucker!
Hold on!
Hey!
Please!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
- It'll make it easier...
- If we let her get her things...
- we'll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house...
- I am calm!
- If she calms down...
I will let her in the house for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens to not want to leave.
- Can I go in?
Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to me.
He's locked up most of my important stuff.
All my papers and things...
I have to get them.
So don't let him come up here.
I know they're in here in the desk...
Fuck.
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.
Are you watching for him?
Got 'em.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it'll just be a couple...
We got other things to do too.
I'll hurry her up.
- How's everything else besides this?
- Fine.
Fine.
- How's your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
- Oh, good.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
We're kind of happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing and then we can go.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shit!
God!
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.
And it would be great... if you guys could just follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
I just need to pick up a little cash inside.
Could you come with me?
- Charlie, you've got to stop her.
You've got to stop her.
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What can I do?
- She's a fuckin' junkie.
She's out of her fucking mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
- Oh!
- There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Half...
I'm coming down.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag.
If you could just ask the guy for the big bag.
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.
- Lady, I can't take it.
- No, you can, you can.
You've been so nice to me.
- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can...
Oh, God, it's him.
You have to stop him.
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.
Mr. Roth...
Mr. Roth...
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
Hey.
- She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
- There's nothing we can do.
She had the keys.
- She's on the account.
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
- We're placing you under arrest for...
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- But I'm just trying to leave.
After all the threats and all the bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
- But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
- But it was mine.
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn't do anything.
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.!
We have a warrant!
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...
- Paradise.
We managed to really fuck it all up.
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.
F.B.I. We have a federal search warrant.
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- My name is Mark Casper.
Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?
- Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.
You can make a phone call, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
They got almost everybody else.
- This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.
Put every box on the table.
Ah, yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
Green?
Don't even ask.
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn't.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'm willing to tell you whatever you want to know.
- I've got nothing to hide here.
- Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
- Oh, this is good.
Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Look at this.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.
What a fuckin' balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?
- Take it easy.
- Wait!
- Wait a minute!
He's sick!
Oh, God!
- Move back.
- I think it's his heart!
Oh, God!
Is he breathing?
- C.P.R. Now!
Poor Artie.
He got so upset, he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- Artie!
No, I won't calm down!
- He's my husband!
Artie!
Artie!
- We can't help him if...
And at the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that?
But I didn't want to look at them.
I didn't want to look at the guys who brought them either.
Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
When the bosses were arrested, some of them were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set.
- We're going to take a recess.
- When it looked like they could get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming' a casino... sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the courthouse.
See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fuckin' Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
Remo, what do you think?
Look... why take a chance?
At least, that's the way I feel about it.
Call Artie.
Tell him, I don't care what...
- he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with that guy...
As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
- He thought nobody would find him there.
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So, naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you goin', jag-off?
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked.
Oh, no!
No!
No!
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels.
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was 3,600 in mint condition coins.
No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
- Hey, Nicky.
And so did the powers that be.
- How are you?
- How you doin'?
It took months for everything to calm down.
But, finally, my guys got out on bail... and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin' dollars.
I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
I mean, what's right is right.
They don't give a fuck about...
Holy fuckin'!
What the fuck...
Come on, motherfucker!
- Tough guys!
You and your fuckin' brother!
- You fuckin' scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
- Frankie!
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker!
Piece of shit!
No, no, no, no!
Take this motherfucker out!
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
All right.
Strip him.
No balls.
You got no fuckin' balls.
Ah, Dominick.
Ah, Dom.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Oh, Dominick.
Come on, come on.
- Bury them?
- Bury them.
The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
- They buried them while they were still breathing.
Mister, you all right?
Watch out!
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.
They had other ideas for me.
We need some help over here!
You sure are lucky, mister.
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
And while the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checkin' into an airport.
And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the Pyramids?
Junk bonds.
Still not sure?
Probable.
Maybe questionable.
Let me know as soon as you can find out.
But in the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that.
# Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights #
# Dreaming of a song #
# The melody haunts my memory #
# And I am once again with you #
# When our love was new #
# And each kiss an inspiration #
# Ah, but that was long ago #
# And now my consolation #
# Is in the stardust of a song #
# Beside a garden wall #
# When stars were bright #
# And you were in my arms #
# The nightingale told his fairy tale #
# Of paradise #
# Where roses grew #
# Though I dream in vain #
# In my heart #
# It will remain #
# My stardust melody #
# The memory #
# Of love's refrain ##
ADAPTED FROM A TRUE STORY
When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.
There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.
Otherwise, what's the point?
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.
Before I ever ran a casino, or got blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.
I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I'd change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I'm serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on Earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money.
$62, 700,000.
I don't know all the details.
In fact, nobody knew all the details... but it should've been perfect.
He had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should've been so sweet, too.
It turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fucking valuable again.
Vegas was a place where suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
You gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you're talking about 30 or 45 minutes of digging.
Who knows who's gonna be coming along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fucking night.
THE STRIP
- LAS VEGAS TEN YEARS EARLIER
Who could resist?
Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler... always looking over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and went to work.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It's like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
What do you think we're doing here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comped trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It's all been arranged Just for us to get your money.
That's the truth about Las Vegas.
We're the only winners.
The players don't stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the Holy of holies, the count room.
Now, this place was off-limits.
Even I couldn't get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.
They had so much money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills.
And the best part was that upstairs... the Board of Directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
To them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify $5,000.
The guys in the counting room... were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
They'd even take cash right out of the drop-boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standing in front of $2 million... to skim the cash off the top without anybody getting wise... the IRS or anybody.
Notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always looking the other way.
Look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They're counting money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra $100 a week...
Just to watch the door.
It's routine.
Business as usual... in, out, hello, goodbye.
That's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walking out of a casino with a suitcase.
Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place:
Right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without getting themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.
And they wanted it every month.
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
- Something smells good.
- They made us something to eat.
The bosses would come from all over:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest... and they would meet in this produce market in Kansas City.
Nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do the cooking.
Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
These old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.
Mama, that man's here again.
Because they controlled the Teamsters Unión.
And that's where you had to go to borrow money to buy a casino.
Would you put in shrimp?
I would.
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
About 20 pounds.
Around $700,000.
Good.
It's a little early for Las Vegas... but I want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry...
As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, head of the Teamsters' Pensión Fund... was a legitimate guy.
A powerful man.
He played golf with the President.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pensión Fund...
I'm glad to present...
But he also took orders.
When he was told to give a pensión-fund loan to Philip Green this check for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
... he did what he was told.
Here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.
He didn't want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him money.
He wanted to believe they gave him the money because he was smart.
I say that knowing just how much competition we have in this city.
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that he was an Arizona real-estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his fucking check.
And it was the bosses' man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the Chairman of the Board, Philip Green.
I understand.
Now all they needed was... someone they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
He was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fucking place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot to run a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don't know if I could do this.
The Gaming Commissión would never give me a license.
I have at least 24 gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The State law says that you can work in a casino... while they process your application.
They got a 10-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out?
We're putting $100 million here.
Why would they lock us out?
They'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
Then they put your application at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys who've worked there for 30 years don't have a license.
It's a tough proposition, Andy.
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious.
No interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
And that's how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title, too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15, and he always made money.
He didn't bet like you or me.
Having some fun with it, shit like that.
Where did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly.
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.
He had to know everything.
He'd find out the inside stuff nobody else knew... and that's what he'd put his money on.
BACK HOME YEARS AGO Even back home, years ago... when we first hung out, he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...
I'll take Columbia for $20,000.
... if his girlfriend was knocked up.
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the bounce you got off different kinds of wood... on college basketball courts.
He'd be working on this day and night.
He knew everything about a game he would bet on.
Ace got down at $6,000.
Get me down at $6,000.
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that's just the way he was.
Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fucking degenerate gambler who always lost.
All those fucking sweeps.
Unless Ace made his bets.
Enough now!
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
Fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fucking zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fucking Remo everything.
And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
Keeping Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma...
How'd you do it?
That's why they paid so well.
You see?
Never tells me nothing.
What do we got on for next week?
It's a little too early.
I'll know by Thursday.
Is that all right?
You'll come by the house?
I'll come by.
At 7:00.
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up.
Hey, Nick.
I'll be right out.
See that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He's making a lot of money for us.
And he'll continue making money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like the fucking Feds out there, without brains.
Okay?
All right.
Want me to take this?
Now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks with the Golden Jew.
Couple of shooters for the ladies.
Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
They all made money with us.
How did Nicky collect?
Don't ask.
Then where the fuck is the money?
I don't see it.
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.
Who's this guy?
Get the fuck out.
I laid nine.
It was eight.
Ace, tell him the line on the Bears game.
- Eight.
- Lf he don't know, nobody knows.
It was eight.
How come I laid nine?
'Cause you're a jag-off.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Is this your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen.
Why?
It's nice.
I didn't know whose it was.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Thank you.
Why don't you take that fucking pen... and shove it up your ass, you fucking jag-off?
- Well, I was just offering...
- Asshole.
Look out, Joe.
What's that?
You hear a little girl?
Is that a little fucking girl?
What happened to the tough guy... who told my friend to stick it up his fucking ass?
Nicky, take it easy.
While I tried to figure out why the guy said what he said...
Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
If you beat him with a gun, you'd better kill him... because he'll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
With me protecting Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
That's what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fucking drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.
In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the good old boys.
Without us, these guys would still be shoveling mule shit.
You've got to keep a cleaner station.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him.
Won't happen again, Sam.
Mr. Rothstein.
It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
Thanks, Senator.
They passed the laws, owned the courts.
I need a room.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials coming through weekly.
Get him what he wants.
Certainly.
Why not make them happy?
For politicians, like our State Senator up there... everything was on the house.
These guys won their comped life when they got elected.
Why not take advantage of it?
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat.
That's the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big.
He has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
A year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and $2 million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
What went wrong?
I'm awfully sorry.
These mechanical things happen.
Better here than up there.
Then he missed the flights connecting with Japan.
I can't believe there's no room.
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
- Sorry you missed your plane.
- You'd like some of my money back.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet $1,000 a hand, instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.
But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa... was that they can't bet small for long.
He didn't think of it as winning $10,000... he thought of it as losing $90,000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up $1 million of his own cash.
In a casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all.
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.
Since the players are looking to beat the casino... the dealers are watching the players... the boxmen are watching the dealers... the floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I'm watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
Yes!
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.
Looking good.
Let's go.
This is for Ginger.
Let me have $100 on your hard 10.
Thank you.
Here we go now.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This $100 is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
- Come on.
- What's the matter?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I've seen you stealing.
"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.
I want my half.
I've watched you.
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of chips.
I didn't steal anything from you.
Get lost!
Get lost?
Yes!
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!
What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
Ginger's missión in life was money.
I'll be right back.
See you.
Thanks for asking.
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers and helped them spend a lot of money.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
Great.
You might have something for me.
Got me covered?
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
Who didn't want her?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
How you doing tonight?
Good.
How are you?
Beat.
Ginger had the hustlers' code.
Take one for you.
Thank you.
She knew how to take care of people.
That's what Vegas is all about.
$6,800.
Thanks.
It's kickback city.
Have a good night.
She took care of the dealers... pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... who took care of the security guards, who took care of the cops... who let her operate.
I need that stuff tonight.
No problem.
You are a doll.
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager Just to get the concessión.
But one thing I didn't understand... was that she had everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
I got other people in this.
I got partners.
I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?
You'll get yours back, and you'll get it back first.
Okay?
- All right.
- Where you going?
Where are you?
You're in that place.
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.
Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
- You are.
- I am.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...
- chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.
He was always broke.
He always had a story.
Somehow, she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it was that he was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
BACK HOME
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
He took care of himself only too well.
That's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
I folded these things beautifully.
I would appreciate a little respect.
Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
Even after a vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Frank Marino was there to meet him.
So were the cops.
They wanted to pinch him...
- for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Help me fold these.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where.
They were usually right.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
There we go.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
I mean that's what worried me... 'cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
All right, we're clear.
There's more.
There's a couple stuck in there.
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What's that?
There's no more.
Thanks.
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn't send me out to have a good time.
They sent me out to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fucking skim.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?
Hey, Sammy.
- Boy, look at this place.
- Incredible.
Welcome to Vegas.
Okay, Sammy.
Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What've you been doing out here?
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick.
They're dear friends of mine.
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
You mean I have your permissión?
Sure, you do.
But I just gotta tell you... it's no joke out here.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It's not like back home.
They don't like guys like us.
This sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even coppers aren't afraid to bury people in the desert.
I don't care.
I want to get away from back home for a while.
I'm tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Ace saw Vegas one way...
Call and tell him I'm coming?
Of course.
... but I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
They had bookies, pimps, and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started getting everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
He had a foolproof scheme.
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected.
When he lost, he told the bookies to fuck off.
What were they gonna do?
Muscle Nicky?
Nicky was the muscle.
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?
Nicky, I thought you was laying.
I was laying?
No, I'm taking it.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fucking face through this window... you'll get unconfused.
- Give me the fucking money.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it.
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was laying it.
- My fucking head.
- Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first President.
George Washington was born...
But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
We presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town... like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
You got a beautiful swing.
Ace got Little Nicky involved with Little League.
It was great.
Turned out that one of the other coaches was a metro intelligence cop.
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.
He's gotta realize everything can't be a home run.
That's exactly what I tell him, but that's the kind of kid he is.
And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.
I was to make sure no other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fucking balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of $200,000.
Yeah, right, I'm sure.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm over here now.
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase, and then he left.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's out?
I think he went across the street or somewhere else or something.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
- Thanks, Eddy.
- Lots of luck.
Good luck to you, too.
They forgot to sign their papers.
They don't need those anymore.
Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
They're the morons who give you the most trouble.
We'd catch them and they'd try to sneak back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy.
He's betting lavender chips... at $500 each with only one little problem.
He's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fucking greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they're all greedy.
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.
He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card... and signaling his buddy at this table.
And that's just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over to Pit 2 right away.
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Jeff
Happy birthday to you
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
They never know what hit them.
If and when they do find out they got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fucking pals were knocking this place dead for years.
He's wired.
What are you doing?
There it is.
That's it.
Cheater's justice.
Oh, God!
No!
I wanted everybody to know that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand.
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.
You can't do it with both hands?
No, sir.
- Can you do it with your left hand?
- I never tried.
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
- It's $100,000, $110,000 I think.
- Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hi.
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
By the way, send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
Sure will.
Real special.
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
Having a good time?
Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
I have a plane to catch.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
I'm gonna give you a choice:
You can have the money and the hammer, or you can walk out of here.
- What do you want?
- I wanna get out of here.
Tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fucking right.
If you come back, either one of you, we'll break your fucking heads.
You see that fucking saw?
We're gonna use it.
We don't fuck around here.
Got it?
Yes.
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.
Throw him out in the alley.
Tell the cops he got hit by a car.
Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters, the pro was way up... the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We're not getting any younger.
Don't you think it's time?
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?
Banging around, hustling around?
- Are you trying to handicap me?
- I'm gonna do you one better.
I'm trying to marry you.
You wanna marry me?
I'm serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.
What do you know?
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.
I can't think of anybody better to be with.
I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people?
'Cause I don't.
I know all that.
I care about you.
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.
All right.
Understand?
I'm sorry.
No...
That can grow.
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.
What is love anyway?
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.
It's a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out... if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.
So whatever happens... if it doesn't work out between us...
I'll make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.
If there are kids, especially...
I'll take care of you better than you'd imagine.
What are you pitching me?
Just what I said.
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.
That I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories... but I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town.
He knew they'd show.
He knew they all wanted something from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.
Even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby first, before they could get married.
He even made us watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
I didn't mind, we loved the kid.
Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don't make me come there.
Answer me.
I love you.
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
Yes.
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
You do?
Yeah, I do.
It's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.
I'm looking at you right now.
I'm seeing you for the very first time, right this minute.
I'm saying I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
Every time I see you, that's what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
- Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
- I'm okay.
You just have to understand.
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I just...
I think I have a right to do that.
Okay?
It's all right.
That part of your life is over with.
Right?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
- Yeah.
- Right?
You're sure?
Yeah.
Want to go?
Let's go back in.
Okay.
It's great.
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can't...
Try it on.
It's yours.
You're kidding.
My God.
- What is it?
- It's chinchilla.
It's so soft.
Nice, isn't it?
No one's ever been so nice to me.
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's too much if I wear these all on the same day?
You can do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
You're so wonderful.
The jewelry's not so bad either.
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
With over $1 million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas... only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
So I put $2 million cash in a Los Ángeles bank... under the name of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
This is just a signature card.
Once she signs, she'll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Sure I do.
Why?
It's good.
It's just unusual.
To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
To play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a license.
Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was Nicky was dreaming of his own kind of Vegas.
I put money out on the street charging three points a week.
Juice to the dealers.
- Don't make us look for you.
- You won't have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, the next thing I did, I started busting out high-stakes poker players.
It was so obvious.
All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were signal-happy.
I'm gonna open for $500.
Signaling back and forth.
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.
I wished Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.
I can't do that.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.
Ace was so worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doing out here in the first place.
A million times, I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:
"This is Las Vegas.
"We're supposed to be out here robbing, you dumb fucking hebe. "
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.
Tell him to take his feet off the table.
Does he think this is a goddamn sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table... and put your shoes on, please?
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.
Fucking asshole won't budge.
Call security.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Do me a favor.
Want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes on?
Fuck you.
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, off his feet... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
You mind coming with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain't going anywhere with you.
Bullshit.
You're out of here.
Fuck you!
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Leave me alone!
Come on!
You gotta be kidding me!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
I didn't know that.
You know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
Then he called me a faggot.
What?
I threw that cocksucker out.
Come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
Told him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
You fucking hick, you!
You go over there.
You apologize.
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get out of line again, I'll smash your head so hard... you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fucking hick.
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.
He's already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...
I swear he'll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he's out for good.
I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.
Go over and apologize.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired Jonathan and David away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.
But, I tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fucking angles.
He brought the whole Femme Fatale show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh them once a week so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.
You're still eight pounds over.
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir...
Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them...
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I don't know why.
She's frightened if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris...
- It's been our policy...
- Stop everything.
She's an institution.
That's the problem.
She's lazy.
I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So he took bookie joints off the street... and opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years, he had... every casino on The Strip trying to copy off of him.
Between my innovations... and Nicky's dedication to his job...
I soon had the best operation on The Strip.
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you.
Why, somebody is complaining?
I'm hearing things from security.
They're all ex-cops.
The sheriff wants to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
There's two names in it for the whole country... and one of them is still Al Capone.
They put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.
You won't be able to walk into a casino.
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.
I'm just telling you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
Back home, they'd put me in jail for what I'm doing.
But out here, they're giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... from the Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife work the room.
They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.
We'd love to have her there.
3:00, Saturday.
- Yes, okay.
- Great.
She made everybody feel good.
- Congratulations, Sam.
- Thanks.
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've seen.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fucking kid.
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
Do you wanna see this one?
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.
But as much as they loved her...
Fabulous.
... they didn't know what really moved her.
Look at this.
Daddy gave me...
With Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doing back there?
You can't even see them.
Okay.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front.
- Bring them up front.
- All right, I will.
Listen carefully.
There are three ways of doing things here.
The right way, the wrong way, and the way that I do it.
- Understand?
- I do understand.
I'll get right on it.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Just do it.
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right.
I'm so sorry.
So I ended up working 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him that I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
You might as well get something out of it.
It wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Vegas.
From then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in or near Vegas.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"...detrimental to gaming and...
"he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
"And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000...
"every time he shows up."
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, you got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation."
Motherfucker.
- Is there any way around this?
- No, there's no way.
Let's say, for instance...
I want to go into the restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can't even set foot in the parking lot.
That's how serious it is.
- In other words, I'm fucked?
- In so many words, yes.
It didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.
You're listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do something.
They ain't getting rid of me.
They're not getting rid of me.
I'm staying here.
Fuck them.
So once they pulled that shit...
I started doing my own things in Vegas nobody had thought of doing.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother and some desperados... from back home and started knocking over high rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers, anybody right here in town.
I had a good fucking crew going for me, I'll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
Then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy could bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
I opened up my own jewelry store, too.
The Gold Rush.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, Just for the fun of it.
I didn't like the people I was ripping off looking at me... so I turned their fucking pictures around.
What's taking so long?
This is a motherfucker!
It's working.
Learn to open these instead of taking them.
These stones got a lot of niggers in them.
If that fucking Pepe's switching stones on us... he better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.
- They're in Penthouse "K."
- Check in alone?
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
- All right.
Thanks.
He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen...
- You got to hurry.
- Okay.
...valet parkers...
- They're just checking in now.
- I'll tell him.
...pit bosses...
Room 1230 at the Scirocco.
- 1230.
Right.
...secretaries.
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition?
All right.
They all got a piece of the score.
Car's coming.
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else, if not... they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
What the fuck did they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?
- This diamond has flaws in it.
- There's no flaws in it.
Don't tell me.
I'm doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws in this diamond.
When we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs, or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
Are you gonna have a meeting or buy some diamonds?
I know his language.
I'm talking with him.
$40,000, you buy the whole package.
$20,000.
That's my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.
She fell asleep on the couch watching TV every night.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.
The bosses were making so much money with the casinos... that they didn't want anybody making any waves.
You've all given your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.
That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you must be prepared to take some kind of loss.
I put some money in legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.
- You will try to push it through, won't you?
- Yes.
You got to understand, I'm giving you $50,000 cash.
Then I put more money in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Is that the last one?
Yeah.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it.
Fuckers.
Here you go, guys.
- Thanks a lot.
- Enjoy it.
Have a good time.
- Choke on it, motherfucker.
- Hi, Dom.
How you doing?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with them.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgiris and movie stars hanging out all over.
That show at The Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
- Made you a messenger, too?
- I'll do anything for a buck.
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.
I got to tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.
To them, Nicky was the movie star.
- You walk past me?
- This is Shelly.
- Hi, Shelly.
How are you?
- Hi.
This is Stacy.
- This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
Come on.
- All right.
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
You can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.
Lt'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?
You call yourself a man?
You know you're a lying lowlife, motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fucking heat's off?
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?
- No, you didn't?
- I didn't.
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?
Tell me you gambled the money and I'll give you the money to put the heat on!
Did you gamble?
Fucking degenerate, you.
Fucking kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck out of here.
Thanks, Nick.
Yeah, thanks.
If I find out you fucked up, I'll leave you where I find you.
How many of these you gonna eat?
Two.
At around 6:30 a.m., when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?
Not a lot.
You know why, right?
Why?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.
Every couple of weeks, I sent Marino back to the bosses...
BACK HOME with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message...
I would carry things out to a "T."
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo's bars.
Here's a fucking guy who kills two of Remo's guys... and a poor fucking waitress who was just working on her night off.
This guy's just begging to be made an example of.
I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
I don't care what you have to do to them to get them.
You understand?
I'll take care of it.
To be truthful with you, I had to admire this fucking guy.
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.
This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two nights, we beat the shit out of him.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
Hope he gives me a name, or I'll give him yours, Frank.
Thanks a lot.
But he never talked.
I know you would've ratted by now.
In the end, I had to put his fucking head in a vice.
Can you hear me?
Listen to me.
I got your head in a vice.
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.
Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Fuck you.
Motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?
You motherfucker!
Oh, God.
Give me the fucking name!
Charlie M.
- Charlie M.
- Charlie M?
You make me pop your eye out your head... to protect that piece of shit?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
You motherfucker!
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.
Word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
Charlie M.
Four reels, sevens across.
Three $15,000 jackpots.
You have any idea what the odds are?
It's gotta be in the millions.
Maybe more.
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?
Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?
It happened quick.
Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.
You didn't see the scam?
There's no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
An infallible way.
They won!
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
You're pissing me off.
You're insulting my intelligence.
You think I'm an idiot?
Somebody had to get into those machines and set the reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.
It can't happen.
What's the matter with you?
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
- You didn't see that?
- I think you're overreacting.
Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.
I've carried your ass ever since I got here.
Get your things and get out of here.
- You're firing me?
- I'm firing you.
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.
- This is not the way to treat people.
- If you didn't know about the scam... you're too dumb to work here.
If you did, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.
Go on.
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.
You can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everyone out here with cowboy boots is a commissioner or related to one.
I'm sick of this.
This is his state.
His uncle's Chief Judge.
His brother-in-law runs the County Commissión.
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
You're in the finances, upstairs.
You don't see what's going on.
I've got thousands of players.
I got 500 dealers.
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.
That there is not one single thing I will not catch.
Look at yours.
Look at that.
Look at this.
There's nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
- I have nothing.
- What are you talking about?
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Where are you going?
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that will take?
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
Wanna go to Mommy?
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
- What do you need?
- Got her?
I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don't you take it out of your account?
I would, it's just that...
I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
$25,000?
- For yourself?
- Yeah.
Why do you need that much?
What's the difference?
I just need it.
I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.
It's not a box of popcorn.
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.
We don't have to have a fight.
It was important to me.
Forget it.
Something I wanted to do.
Who's fighting?
Tell me what it's for.
Why can't you tell me what it's for?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for $25,000.
Do you want a coat?
No.
If you want a coat, you got it.
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
I've been independent all my life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
Now you're making me beg you for this.
- What are you talking about?
- Okay?
And you're embarrassing me.
Why make me feel so bad?
You're asking me for $25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
It's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you can tell me what the money is for.
She's leaving the bank now.
I'll follow her.
What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
It means I got the money.
How are you doing?
It's Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
If I'm wrong, correct me.
I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine, too.
Take it.
You already have hers.
She's my wife.
Look at me.
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew she's my wife?
Look at me.
I know that.
You do, yeah?
If you ever come back again... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.
Now, you want to do me a favor?
Get out of here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Fucking piece of shit.
Remember when you called him that night and said goodbye to him?
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."
- He didn't say that, did he?
- No, he didn't.
What did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Make them stop it!
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!
Piece of shit.
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He's such a prick.
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn't want to do it himself.
He didn't want to get his own hands dirty.
Why did he have to do that?
Tell me.
It wasn't a nice thing to do...
No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down.
I told him all about this guy before we got married.
- This is no fucking surprise.
- You did?
I didn't know that.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
The first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you.
He really loves you.
He does.
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open.
I knew the bottom could drop out any time.
I'm a working girl.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this... if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?
Sure, I can see that.
So he put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.
A lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I'm just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I'm told it's worth about $1 million, maybe more.
There you go.
What does that tell you?
$1 million in jewelry.
Does that tell you he is crazy about you?
I should have never married him.
He's a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.
I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
This is probably not...
I don't have the answers anyway.
- This is probably not what you want to hear.
- I do.
You're a little upset, and I understand that.
But try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could've killed him!
He didn't have to hit him.
I'm not sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What the fuck is that all about?
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worries.
Who gives a fuck what I do?
I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Thanks... for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl.
Don't ruin that.
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You're so nice.
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.
Thanks.
It's all right.
County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you, little lady.
Send him in and call me four minutes after.
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
How do you do?
- It is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.
Thank you, sir.
House is doing well.
All that money is rolling in.
I appreciate you taking the time to see a poor old civil servant.
Why don't you have a seat?
Thank you, sir.
I come here personally to smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
Maybe you didn't know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends.
His family and their money go back many years.
Friends vote, family and money votes.
That's important to me and you.
If you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you'll forgive me for saying it... maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
He knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
Either he was in on it or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he'd be under arrest.
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky?
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.
What you're saying is libelous.
You're in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be helpful and courteous to that kid.
He's weak.
He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.
There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favor... if you'd think some more on hiring him back.
I can't do that.
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law.
I do want to help you and I like to do favors.
And I know who you are.
But I cannot do that.
Could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.
He's too incompetent.
The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.
Okay, thanks a lot.
That's it.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests.
But you act like you're at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.
But that's where we'll send you if it harelips the Governor.
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- You bet.
What happened to my pills?
Isn't it bad enough you drink too much?
You're taking my pills, too?
I didn't take your pills.
For my ulcer, I take a half of one of these.
That's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with them?
You didn't have to beat him up.
What?
I was just trying to help him.
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring about people.
What?
I said... you can't make me stop caring about people.
Listen...
I'm trying to make the best of everything here.
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.
People look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit.
I'm getting out of here.
You gotta get a hold of yourself.
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Understand?
Your drinking's getting way out of hand.
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.
That's all you care about.
You don't care about me.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that stuff, that fucking leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Oh, God.
I'll try.
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rolling in... and the suitcases kept coming and going.
And let me tell you, the fucking bottom line here is cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this fucking trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the scam... he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Right?
You go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the whole purpose of what we're doing.
They take this money because they're my guys, so give them some leeway.
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.
What were you doing with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
What you been doing?
I'm out there more than I'm here.
Little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they would've been better off making fucking novenas.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
- My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
- What expenses?
I'm laying money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping records.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.
What the hell are we doing over here?
You're going to Las Vegas and having a good time at my expense.
What the fuck?
I mean, after all...
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
I can't believe you're doing this.
We made a deal.
It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity"... had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and demanded money from Tangiers...
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because you're wrong.
I'm not.
You are.
No, I am not wrong.
... Green tried to stonewall her.
I will see that you don't get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its President, Philip Green.
Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
Thank you.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decisión.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
That's not good.
She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start counting her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
Any comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
What are you talking about?
She was found last night shot in the head.
Was this just a real estate partnership?
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
Did you ever hear of the.22 caliber killer?
Now, Instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green, too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with other real estate deals, and things.
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the Chairman of the Board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
Have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties...
"says that he is the real boss of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."
Do you believe that?
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.
Has that man even filed for his license yet?
I don't know.
We have to check the files.
Without getting your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation of Tangiers executive...
Sam Rothstein's application for a gaming license is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino...
Hello?
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
No, it's okay.
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible.
It's booked up, and it's very difficult to get in.
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.
All right.
The battle between state gaming officials and Tangiers casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law-enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?
Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
At 6:00, will a boyhood friendship... unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
Go down.
Just go downstairs.
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.
It's just a political witch hunt.
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, you want a refill?
- Yeah, that would be great.
I don't want nothing.
Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.
- You're tougher to get than the President.
- I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
I think you've gotten the wrong impressión about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fucking head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm coming out of jail... hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fucking head open again.
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like that.
You fat Irish prick!
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.
- You think he got the point?
- What are you doing?
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.
That prick's been dodging me for three weeks.
- You're trying to tell me what to do?
- I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
You're way out of line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.
If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me... you're gonna have to go my way.
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
I got $100 million a year going through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that license.
Believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fucking license.
I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a license.
I don't know what it is, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
It's taken out of context.
I had no control.
Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on televisión, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to you?
You lost control?
- I lost control?
You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat people with disrespect.
Even your own wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?
No, that's not the fucking point.
The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life.
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
A week ago it was.
Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.
Right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy's gonna run to the FBI.
Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.
I knew what he wanted and I didn't want any part of it.
He wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
He also stopped asking permissión from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
They questioned Nicky.
When some guys who didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.
If a guy tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Be nice.
The bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealing with degenerate animals out here.
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sitting on their asses drinking anisette.
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fucking bosses think it's a fucking free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
I heard.
Everybody's talking about it and making a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
That's no good.
Tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Fucking bosses smoking their Di Nobilis... and eating trip' and fucking soffrit', fried pigs' guts... while if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.
- What do they care?
Long as I send money.
- They're complaining.
Let them complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
It's up to you.
They want a fucking war?
I'm ready.
If I take care of five of those guys, the rest will fall into place.
Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself, but on me, too.
The FBI watched every move he made, but he just didn't care.
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch them back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment from the same places that sell to the CIA.
I had all the special police frequency radios, FBI de-scramblers, night-visión cameras...
So, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.
I got my job on the line, he's having the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watching him, and he's out playing golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
If I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us with the books and papers.
That'll mean a lot when you go before the commissión.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This honesty will guarantee it.
We'll move on to...
I want to hear about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this fucking guy gonna land, in the fairway?
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.
$100, whoever hits the plane.
If things weren't bad enough... in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases.
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but he mostly complained about his trips to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.
You gotta lay down the law, or they'll make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fucking nickel goes down.
- What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll take the eyes out of his freaking head.
- Again.
- I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
What happens next, you can't believe it.
Who'd believe the FBI had a wire in the place...
looking for information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what?
What prevents him with the suitcases from taking what he wants?
Nance brings back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
He's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together.
I'll find out.
If it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
I got eyes behind my head.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
I'll hit the two of them in the head with a shovel.
Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beating me left and right.
I'm sorry.
I'm upset.
I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.
Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack.
I know.
I'm too upset.
The damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases... and that's it.
Everything's coming out of my pocket.
I gotta pay.
Would you believe this could happen?
I'm in this to make money, not lose it.
Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now.
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
Piscano, this guy, basically sunk the whole world.
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
Members of the Commissión...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBI agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counselor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked this Commissión acts on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Denying?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye!
- Aye!
Aye!
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBI reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?
I was never your guest.
Never my guest?
I never comped you?
I don't comp you at least three times a month?
I'd like to answer that at this time.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at the dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering.
You were in the building.
I was in the building?
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
Give me that much at least!
Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein... accused top gaming officials of corruption.
...promised me a fair hearing when you were comped at my hotel?
And you asked for copies of your bill to put on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...
Bullshit!
... Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
You guys think you have the right to pass judgment!
Long suspected of running Tangiers without a license... yesterday's hearing was to determine if someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fucking hypocrites!
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.
What's he doing?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
Won't be the best, but what are we gonna do?
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.
Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new sports book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best U.S. Football handicapper.
A man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
Now, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
Mr. Sam Rothstein.
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein show.
We're happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy... who is a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
Keep an eye on him.
I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say, eight children.
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
Ace, don't do it.
Jesus.
He's juggling!
Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
What the hell is he doing on televisión?
He's on all night, screaming about taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fucking mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
First, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
We're on the list to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.
These guys don't care about the Supreme Court.
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
What do you do about that?
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break... it would give everybody time to maneuver.
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.
I can't do that.
Of course, as soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
I've got to do some shopping.
Want to go?
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
On routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I got a sprained fucking elbow.
Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards further down the road.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the same outfit.
I saw something.
Something very cute.
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
He's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around anymore.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
Meeting in the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of coming back alive... from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
Where the fuck you get off talking to people behind my back?
- What people?
- Did you think I wouldn't find out?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
You said I'm bringing heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of you?
You're ordering me out?
You better get your own fucking army!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
You want me to get out of my own fucking town?
Yeah, let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.
You know that you only have your fucking casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.
And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?
I get calls from back home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You could've had the food-and-beverage job without going on TV!
- You wanted to go on TV.
- Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
I'm known.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
You brought down so much heat on me.
Every time I meet somebody, they ask me if I know you.
Sure, now you wanna blame your fucking license on me.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
I knew you'd come out no matter what I said.
Do you remember?
Back up a fucking minute here.
One minute.
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally...
Every fucking wise guy still around will take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fucking warned.
Don't go over my fucking head again, you motherfucker, you!
Well, we got company.
Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he acts like he doesn't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Forget about it.
Don't let it bother you.
Does it look like it's bothering me?
Why do I give a fuck?
Oscar, too.
All the money I gave him, that prick.
He didn't even look over.
What's his fucking problem?
- Fucking Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're having a good time.
So are we.
Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about $10,000.
Now he's really pissed.
- He wants a $50,000 marker.
- Just give him $10,000.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
He's gonna come up with $10,000 just the way you want.
No, I said fucking $50,000!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take it but don't wanna give it back.
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
Do you give a fuck?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fucking mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
Sherbert send you in here to rob me now?
Been fucking knocking everybody's dick in all night?
Been beating the customers?
Jag-off.
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
Keep looking at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep looking at him for?
You fucking...
Look at this, 20 paints in a row.
Hit me again.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get out of here.
- Tell this motherfucker to pay that marker.
You're not listening.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
- I'm gonna okay you $10,000, that's it.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
$10,000 and that's it.
What are you staring at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Get out of here?
I got a marker coming.
Deal.
I know, but everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 11:00 a.m. To 1:00 p.m.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Coming right back to me... or finding some other excuse to come...
We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things and leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life, a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
Everything all right?
What could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
The Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills.
Hello, Beverly Hotel.
Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
Sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?
Yes, they both checked out.
Thank you.
Hello.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife named Lester Diamond.
My daughter's with them.
They're gonna try and kidnap her.
Is there anybody you can send?
We'll take care of it.
We got a number and an address.
Hello.
Is this Lester?
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
I wouldn't.
You shouldn't do this.
You understand?
Put her on the fucking phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
So, listen, can I call you back in a few minutes?
702-472-1862.
I'll call back.
Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
You want to get back at this prick?
You got what, $2 million in that box?
You got a minute?
He's got $2 million in the box, right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash... and the only other thing he cares about.
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
I don't want to go to Europe.
Shut your mouth.
You shut up.
Want me to come over?
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
- Lester, he called you here.
- Right.
Ace was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
Yeah, he's sitting by the phone waiting for you to call him back!
What are we gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fucking house!
- It's this fucking bullshit of yours!
- Get your bag!
Let's go!
- What bullshit?
You want to talk it over?
- Are you done yakking?
Go!
Get in the car!
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
I think he's gonna kill me.
Relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you'll be there, right?
- I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy.
You all right?
Okay, bye.
Knock it off.
She started it.
She started the whole thing.
- Don't even think you're gonna drive.
- I'm gonna drive.
I'm not gonna drive with a crazy woman.
You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we...
Ginger called me.
Yeah?
I just told you she called me.
What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
She's with that cocksucker again.
They got Amy.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
This is family.
It ain't business.
Meanwhile, you made calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
Driving me fucking crazy.
I think if you... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fucking crazy.
Once you get her here, think about it.
Wait till you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane to get her here right away.
That's all I'm asking.
Do you...
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is...
Do you think if I came back...
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where's the box?
- I gotta tell you...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
What's it under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's under $25,000.
It's under $25,000?
Yeah.
The $2 million is still there?
Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his $25,000.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
$25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch, too.
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?
Good evening, signora.
This way.
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but $25,000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch, too.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice... he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000 at the most, which is impossible for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, $1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around $10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just trying to figure it out.
There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
But I've been told before, "We're working it out."
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?
Counting the watch, let's say another $4,000 for expenses this weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fucking piece of shit had a good fucking time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're looking at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed.
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fucking actress.
You can fucking get pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fucking pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
Lucky he's fucking living.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you had run away, he would have been dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
No, it isn't fair.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fucking deal?
I go...
Listen, I just can't fucking take it.
Why should I fucking take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fucking past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
I want him killed.
I've had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
Hello.
Yes, I do!
I fucking hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fucking guts!
You hate my guts?
I want you to come with me now!
I want you out of here!
Take your fucking bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
- You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.
No kidding!
And I still get my money.
I need some cash now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You've never been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
You're lower than a dog!
Fuck you!
Here!
Is this enough money?
Will it last you two fucking days?
Take it!
Greedy bitch.
Take the fucking money.
I'm going to the bank...
- and I'm getting my jewelry, too!
- It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
I'm taking Amy.
You're not.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
I am not!
She's my daughter, too!
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fucking-damn you!
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cut me out of my end!
Fucker!
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
Later, I realized I didn't want to give her the money because if I did...
I knew I'd never see her again.
Have a good day at school, okay?
Okay, ángel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
What are you supposed to do?
What do you wanna do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it...
It's not my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
- I was just...
- What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
Yeah?
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewelry out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there, too.
He's so fucking lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
No, he wouldn't.
I would have.
- He'd have been right, too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I didn't.
I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
You did.
You're right.
I like that.
- That's what I like, you did the right thing.
- I did what you told me to.
- Yes, you did.
- You always tell me the right thing to do.
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
Changed.
- He did.
He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fucking guts.
Come on, you're a toughie.
You can take this.
Don't cry.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
I'll take care of you.
Thank you.
It's what you want, isn't it?
That's Ace's wife.
This is great for the boss.
Hi.
Hi.
You didn't answer your beeper.
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do it.
I know that you want me to, but...
I'm driving down the freeway and the fucking thing beeps.
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
I put her to bed.
I got your cigarettes.
Oscar wants you to call him.
So who'd you go to lunch with?
Jennifer.
Where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a salad.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why I want to do it.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
Hello?
Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
I knew she fucked around.
Yeah, she did what she did, and I did what I had to do, but...
Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie, the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up getting killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up getting killed, too.
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
- He's good, he's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.
You understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
You must've drank too much.
Fuck yourself.
One night, he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix...
Maybe Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- What do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
Drop the gun!
Fuck you!
The cops shot Blue... because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
They could have been right, but who knows?
Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.
What do you want?
It's pitch black.
It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
You moron!
I'll be doing paperwork for two months!
What'll we do?
Sorry!
You jerk-off!
To make matters worse... to get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths... because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
What'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothing.
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
No, you would have heard something.
What's to stop him?
I know.
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
But they keep asking about it.
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a war or something.
I'm not sure yet.
But you know what I want you to do?
Who's this guy?
That ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do?
Get some guys to dig a hole in the desert and show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
I'm not sure yet.
They'll do it.
When I'm ready, I'll say the words:
"Go see the Jew." And you make it disappear.
Know what I mean?
Let me know.
But you gotta be ready.
You know what I'm talking about?
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Where are these pricks at?
They're in the motel?
There or in the fucking bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.
I'll be right back.
Any calls for me, give them to Mr. Sherbert.
- Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
- I'm going home for a few seconds.
He's on his way home.
Okay.
Hello?
Ginger?
Help, Daddy!
Amy!
Amy, open the door!
I can't!
I'm tied!
Dad!
What happened?
Who did this to you?
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose.
No, please!
Okay, I'm gonna be right back.
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
What time did your mother do this?
When did she leave?
I don't know.
Hello?
Sammy.
Yeah.
Who's this?
Me.
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
Yeah, she's here.
I'll be right over.
All right.
- Coming over.
- Great.
Don't make a scene, all right?
I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She's trying to save your marriage.
Nicky, I want to talk to that fucking bitch.
Be fucking nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
Hi.
Are you out of your mind?
You tie up our kid and lock the door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your mind?
It was just for a little while.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to have you committed.
You do that again and I'll...
I was just gonna be out for a little while.
She was asleep.
I was gonna be back...
Listen.
...before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fucking cunt... let me tell you something.
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
You ever touch her again or do anything like that again...
I'll fucking kill you, pure and simple.
You hear me?
Pure and simple.
Why don't you let me go?
I'll kill you.
You fucking whore.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and you to let me go.
Want your jewelry?
Let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you pig?
Get up and be a mother.
Get in the car and go home right now.
Get up and get in...
- Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get up!
Are you threatening me?
I'll fucking kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.
I'm going!
Now you need approval from him to go home?
So what?
Who blew you in the parking lot before you came in?
You make me sick, you fuck.
- Once a hooker, always a hooker.
- Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
Fuck you!
Billy Sherbert, please.
Put him on.
Who's this?
Listen, I'll explain later.
You got a gun at home?
Bring it over right away.
- Take it easy.
I'll do it.
- Okay.
Leave it where it is!
Where is he?
I want that Jew bastard killed!
Hide her car in the back.
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
Supposing he goes back home and makes a fucking beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me.
- Me?
Nothing.
I said...
I said, no.
Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fucking dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."
If it's so fucking dangerous, why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a fucking smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna whack him for you?
Motherfucker.
- I knew it.
- What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?
You think he'll give you money?
Are you out of your mind?
- Look what you did to this guy.
- What?
If you'd just kept your fucking mouth shut.
What's the use!
I should have never got involved...
Hey!
You motherfucker, you!
You fucker!
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!
No!
Get down there!
Take it easy!
I shouldn't have gotten involved with this nut!
You'll kill her.
Take it easy.
Get her out of here.
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
I'm going to the FBI!
I'm not scared anymore!
All right.
Be careful.
You've fucked with me for the last time!
Okay.
Yeah.
Careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
Look at this.
Motherfucker.
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fucking broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fucking spot here.
You know that?
A bad fucking spot.
I left the kid with neighbors.
I had $1 million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put this in the hotel safe and I want you to come back.
She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...
Just wait there for me.
Get down here and talk to me!
You can't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker!
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
Get down here and talk to me, God damn it!
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
I'm going to drive this fucking car through the living room!
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
Come out here and talk to me.
Will you stop it?
You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
I am not!
- You'll be sorry if you don't stop.
- Don't you threaten me!
You're not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
He's my new sponsor!
How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
I don't have to take your shit anymore!
I'm going to the FBI!
I'll go to the police!
- I am not protecting you anymore!
- Mrs. Rothstein...
He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, we've been getting some complaints about the noise.
I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy.
I won't, the way she's behaving.
Won't let me in?
Who knows what you'll do there.
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
Let her in to get a few things.
That way she'll leave.
This is half her house.
I'm afraid.
You aren't afraid!
She'll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
- Hey!
- Fucker!
- Hold on!
Please!
You should be afraid, the way you treat me!
Lt'll make it easier on everybody.
If we let her get her things, we'll be out of your hair.
If she calms down, I'll let her in.
I am calm!
If she calms down...
I will let her in for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she won't leave.
- Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
You wouldn't believe how mean he is.
He's locked up my papers.
I have to get them.
Don't let him come up here... because I know they're in here in the desk.
Fuck.
Pay attention.
He could come up here at anytime.
Are you watching for him?
Got them.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
It'll just be a couple minutes.
We got other things to do, too.
He'll hurry her up.
- How's everything else?
- Fine.
- How's your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
We're happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing, then we can go.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shit!
God!
That pisses me off!
Don't worry.
It would be great... if you could follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
I just need to pick up a little cash.
Could you come with me?
You've got to stop her.
I'm sorry, Sam.
What can I do?
She's a junkie.
She's out of her mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take it.
She can't.
Half of it is mine.
Listen to me.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm coming down.
Shit!
God damn it!
I'll need a bag.
Could you ask the guy for the big bag?
Go get a bag, man.
Here.
- Lady, I can't take it.
- You can.
You've been so nice to me.
Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can...
Oh, God!
It's him.
You have to stop him.
'Cause he said he was gonna kill me.
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
Nothing we can do.
She had the key.
She's on the account.
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
- We're placing you under arrest.
- For what?
- For aiding and abetting...
- For what?
- For aiding and abetting...
- I'm just trying to leave.
After all the threats and bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
They had all the pieces they needed.
But I didn't do anything.
Everyone began to tumble, like dominoes.
FBI!
We have a warrant!
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license... paradise.
We managed to really fuck it up.
Mom.
Someone's at the door now.
FBI.
We have a federal search warrant.
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- I'm Mark Casper, FBI.
- Yeah?
Can I make a fucking phone call?
Yes, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
They got almost everybody else.
This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized.
Put every box on the table.
Yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
Green?
Don't even ask.
...$30,000 of yours.
- No.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
I've got nothing to hide.
Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
Oh, this is good.
He might as well give them a blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.
What a fucking balloon head.
What are you doing?
Take it easy.
Wait!
Wait!
He's sick!
Move back.
It's his heart!
Is he breathing?
CPR now!
Artie got so upset he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- No, I won't calm down!
- He's my husband!
Artie!
- We can't help him if...
At the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
Why protect a friend who betrayed you?
But I didn't want to look at them... or the guys who brought them.
Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
When they were arrested, some were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
Pre-trial services recommends that bail remain as set.
Take recess.
When it looked like they'd get... 25 years to life in prison Just for skimming a casino... sick or no fucking sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse.
When something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fucking Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
What do you think?
Look, why take a chance?
At least that's the way I feel about it.
Call Artie.
Tell him I don't care what... he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning.
It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with him.
As much as they liked him, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
He thought nobody would find him there.
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding...
Just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you going, jag-off?
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up getting whacked.
Oh, no!
No!
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies, and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and jewels.
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was $3,600 in mint condition coins.
No matter what the Feds or the papers said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that, that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
So did the powers that be.
How are you?
How you doing?
It took months for everything to calm down.
But finally, my guys got out on bail.
The bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the fucking dollars.
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
What's right is right.
They don't give a fuck about...
Holy fucking...
What the fuck...
Come on, motherfucker!
Tough guys!
You and your fucking brother!
You fucking scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
Fuck you!
Fucking punk!
Piece of shit!
No!
Take this motherfucker out!
Leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
All right.
Strip him.
No balls.
You got no fucking balls.
Oh, Dominick!
Dominick.
Come on.
Bury them?
Bury them.
The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
They buried them while they were still breathing.
You all right?
Watch out!
Mister, you all right?
Yeah.
They had other ideas for me.
We need some help over here!
You sure are lucky, mister.
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
While the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checking into an airport.
If you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid will want his Social Security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids?
Junk bonds.
Still not sure?
Probable.
Maybe questionable.
All right, let me know as soon as you can find out.
In the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that!
[ Man Narrating ] When you love someone, you`ve gotta trust them.
There`s no other way.
You`ve got to give them the key to everything that`s yours.
Otherwise, what`s the point?
And, for a while, I believed that`s the kind of love I had.
÷÷ [ Choir Singing ]
Before I ever ran a casino, or got myself blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I could change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I`m serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money... $62,700,000.
I don`t know all the details.
[ Man #2 Narrating ] Nobody knew all the details, but it should`ve been perfect.
I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had, Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should`ve been so sweet too.
But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fuckin` valuable again.
[ Ace ] At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn`t see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it`s in the desert where lots of the town`s problems are solved.
[ Nicky ] Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you`re talking about a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin`.
And who knows who`s gonna be comin` along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fuckin` night.
÷÷ [ Scatting ]
[ Horn Honking ]
÷÷ [ Scatting Continues ]
[ Ace ] Who could resist?
Anywhere else in the country I was a bookie, a gambler... always lookin` over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I`m Mr. Rothstein.
I`m not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that`s like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and I went to work.
...the casino manager.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
[ Ace ] For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It`s like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
I mean, what do you think we`re doing out here in the middle of the desert?
It`s all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comp trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It`s all been arranged just for us to get your money.
That`s the truth about Las Vegas.
We`re the only winners.
The players don`t stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the holy of holies, the count room.
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.
Even I couldn`t get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That`s for sure.
[ Nicky ] They had so much fuckin` money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.
And the best part was that upstairs...
- the board of directors didn`t know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.
I mean, to them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify 5,000.
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.
were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They`d do short counts, they`d lose fill slips.
They`d even take cash right out of the drop boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standin` in front of about two million dollars... to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin` wise...
- the irs or anybody.
- Verify 200.
Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody`s always lookin` the other way.
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They`re countin` money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you`re in and you`re out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra C-note a week... just to watch the door.
It`s routine.
Business as usual:
in, out, hello, good-bye.
And that`s all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walkin` out of the casino with a suitcase.
Now that suitcase was goin` straight to one place:
Right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without gettin` themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all... the bosses ever wanted.
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
- Somethin` smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin` to eat.
The bosses would come from all over the place:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest.
And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City.
I mean, nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do all the cookin`.
- Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?
Now, these old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly control Las Vegas.
Mama, that man`s here again.
Because they control the Teamsters Union.
And that`s where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.
- Would you put in shrimp?
- I would.
Here you are, gentlemen.
Nobody got a Teamsters` loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit`s top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
- Definitely the most important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.
- That`s around 700,000.
- Uh-huh, good.
[ Man ] I know it`s a little early for Las Vegas...
[ Laughter ] but I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry.
[ Ace ] As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters` Pension Fund...
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.
He even played golf with the president.
On behalf of the Teamsters` Pension Fund...
- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.
And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... this check for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
he did what he was told.
[ Nicky ] Now, here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn`t know too much.
He didn`t want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money.
He wanted to believe the Teamsters... gave him all that fuckin` money `cause he was smart.
I know full well how much competition we have in this great city.
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money... to come and pick up his own fuckin` check.
And of course it was the bosses` man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the chairman of the fuckin` board, Philip Green.
I understand.
I understand.
Now all they needed was... somebody they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fuckin` place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot at runnin` a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don`t know if I could do this even if I wanted to.
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.
I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don`t have to have a license to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The state law says that you can work in a casino... while they`re processing your application.
They got a ten-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out?
We`re puttin` a hundred million into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?
They`ll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
They take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys been workin` there for 30 years, don`t have a license.
It`s a tough proposition, Andy.
You know if I did it, I`d have to run it my way.
You got it.
I`m serious, no interference.
Nobody`s gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
[ Nicky ] And that`s how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15 years old, and he always made money.
But he didn`t bet like you or me.
You know, havin` some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin` brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly.
- That`s the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.
He had to know everything, this guy.
He`d find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew... and that`s what he`d put his money on.
Even back home, years ago... when we were first hangin` out... he`d know if the quarterback was on coke...
I`ll take Columbia for 20.
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.
He`d get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the different bounce... you got off the different kinds of wood they used... on college basketball courts, you know?
He`d be workin` on this shit day and night.
There was nothing about a game he was gonna bet that he didn`t know.
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don`t think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that`s just the way he was.
But back then, the bosses didn`t give a fuck... about whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fuckin` degenerate gambler who always lost...
Cazzo!
[ Mumbles in Italian ]
All those fuckin` sweeps.
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
I mean, fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fuckin` zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fuckin` Remo everything.
And to tell you the truth, I don`t blame him.
- Hey!
- Keepin` Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi-- How the hell`d you do it?
Well, that`s why they paid so well.
You see?
Never tells me nothin`.
What do we got on for next week?
Well, it`s a little too early.
I`d say Thursday would be good.
ls that all right?
- Okay, you`ll come by the house?
- I`ll come by.
7:00.
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up?
Okay, Ace?
Hey, Nick.
Vien acca.
- I`ll be right out.
- T`aggia parla.
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He`s makin` a lot of money for us.
And he`s gonna continue makin` a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin` friends out there that-- without brains.
- Okay?
- All right.
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah.
Want me to take this for you?
[ Nicky ] So now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around with the golden Jew.
Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.
[ Ace ] Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
- They all made money with us.
- They payin`?
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week, like they`re supposed to.
- Don`t ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don`t see any money.
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.
Who`s this guy?
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine.
I laid nine.
- It was eight.
Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.
- Eight.
- lf he don`t know, nobody knows.
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?
`Cause you`re a jag-off.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- ls this yours?
Your pen?
- Yeah, that`s my pen.
Why?
No, it`s a nice pen.
I just didn`t know whose it was.
I thought it was yours.
I didn`t want it to get lost.
Well, thank you.
Why don`t you take that fuckin` pen... and shove it up your ass, you fuckin` jag-off.
- Well, I was just offering you the--
- This fuckin` assho--
Look out, Joe.
Look out.
[ Grunts ]
[ Groaning ]
What`s that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?
Hear a little girl, Ace?
ls that a little fuckin` girl?
What happened to the fuckin` tough guy...
- told my friend to stick it up his fuckin` ass?
- [ Moans ]
- Nicky, take it easy.
Nicky, Nicky.
- [ Moans ]
[ Ace ] While I was trying to figure out why the guy was saying... what he was saying, Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him... because he`ll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
[ Nicky ] Listen, with me protectin` Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
I mean, that`s what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin` drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn`t be happier.
÷ I got $700 ÷
÷ Don`t you mess with me ÷
÷ But you know I`m down ÷
÷ Everybody knows I`m down ÷÷
[ Ace ] In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the, you know, good old boys.
I mean, without us, these guys, they`d still be shoveling mule shit.
Ward, you`ve got to keep a cleaner space.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him, all right?
Won`t happen again, Sam.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein.
Won`t happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
ls this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
What`s the story?
- You need this guy.
- Can`t get rid of him?
He`s juiced in.
He`s the County Commissioner`s cousin.
I wouldn`t give the bum a mop job.
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
Thank you very much, Senator.
- They passed the laws, they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room.
- I had dozens of politicians and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.
coming through that place every week.
- Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.
Why not make him happy?
...the Presidential Suite.
For politicians like our State Senator up there, everything was on the house.
These guys won their comp life when they got elected... so, hey, why not take advantage of it.
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It`s a whale like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat... that`s the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman lslands.
Downstairs he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and two million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
I don`t know what the hell went wrong.
I`m awfully sorry.
I can`t understand it.
These mechanical things, you know they happen.
Hey, but better here than up there, you know what I mean.
Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan.
I can`t believe that there`s a convention; there`s no room.
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
- I`m sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet 1,000 a hand, instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.
...to the bank with a natural lead over a five.
But I knew the trick with whales like lchikawa... was that they can`t bet small for long.
He didn`t think of it as winning 10,000... he thought of it as losing 90,000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all.
÷ Goddamn it Trying to make it real ÷
÷ Compared to what ÷
÷ Sock it to me ÷
In Vegas, everybody`s gotta watch everybody else.
Six.
All right, who`s gonna give me that?
Since the players are looking to beat the casino...
Each and every roll, all right.
- the dealers are watching the players...
- Six.
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.
the floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I`m watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys up there... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
÷ Tryin` to make it real compared to what ÷
Yes!
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.
Lookin` good.
Lookin` good.
Let`s go.
This is for Ginger.
Come on.
Let me have a hundred on your hard ten.
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!
- Oh, I`m sorry.
- The dice--
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You were great.
Thanks.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
- Come on.
- What`s the matter?
What do you mean?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I`ve seen you stealing from me.
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.
- I want my half.
- I`ve been watching you all night.
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.
- I didn`t steal anything from you.
- Get lost!
Get lost?
Get lost?
Yes!
Yes!
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!
÷ Slippin` and a-slidin` ÷ Changin` and a-hidin` ÷
÷ Been told a long time ago ÷
÷ I been told Baby, you`ve been born ÷
÷ I won`t be your fool no more Oww ÷
÷ Baby, oh, baby ÷
÷ My sweet baby ÷
÷ You`re the one ÷
[ Ace ] What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
÷ What`s different about him ÷
÷ I don`t really know ÷
I`m gonna go powder my nose.
÷ No matter how I try ÷
÷ I just can`t make him cry ÷
- [ Ace ] Ginger`s mission in life was money.
- I`ll be right back.
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers... and helped them spread around a lot of money.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?
- And you do.
Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.
Who didn`t want Ginger?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
÷ You only make me glad ÷
÷ Better listen, little girl ÷
÷ You`re goin` walkin` down the street ÷
÷ I ain`t got no love ÷
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
÷ This heart of stone ÷
- How you doin` tonight?
- Good.
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.
- [ Ace ] Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.
And that`s what Vegas is all about.
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.
- It`s kickback city.
- Have a good night.
Thank you.
You too.
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.
pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, she took care of the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... because they took care of the security guards...
- who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.
- No problem.
- You are a doll.
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.
But one thing I just could never understand... was that she could have everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Gin, you know I got other people in this, they got partners.
I want you to understand that I am looking out for you... in this thing, okay?
You`re gonna get yours back, and you`re gonna get back first, okay?
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?
Where are you?
You`re in that place.
Where are you?
- I`m here.
- No, you`re not.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I`m always here for you.
- You`re my woman.
- I know.
[ Ace ] The Ginger I knew wouldn`t even look at this creep.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag.
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.
And somehow she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
If you find any cash in there, we`ll whack it up with you.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well.
- That`s why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.
- back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.
- Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.
÷ Volare ÷
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops.
This time they wanted to pinch him...
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.
- Hold it, hold it.
Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
- And he didn`t give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.
Look at this.
Beautiful!
I mean, that`s what worried me.
`Cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
- All right, we`re clear.
- There`s more.
There`s a couple stuck in there.
I know there`s more.
- I`m telling you, they`re out!
- Come on.
Don`t get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What`s that?
Huh, what`s that?
There`s no more.
Thanks, hon.
[ Nicky ] I couldn`t wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn`t send me out there to have a good time.
They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fuckin` skim.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin`?
Hey, Sammy.
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- lncredible.
Welcome to Vegas.
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What`ve you been doing out here?
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick, they`re dear friends of mine.
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
[ Ace ] After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
What`s the matter?
You got a problem with that?
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you... it`s no joke out here, it`s no joke.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It`s not like back home.
Right off the bat, they don`t like guys like us.
And this sheriff`s a real cowboy.
Even the coppers aren`t afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don`t care.
I wanna get away from back home for a while.
I`m tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It`s made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody`s gonna know what we`re doing.
There`s nobody here to see us.
Everybody`s back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I`m running a licensed place, everything`s legit.
Don`t worry about it.
I`m not gonna do anything.
I`m especially not gonna involve you in anything.
[ Nicky ] Ace saw Vegas one way...
- You call this guy and tell him I`m comin`?
- Of course.
but I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
I mean, they had bookies, pimps... and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started gettin` everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
[ Ace ] Yeah, he had a foolproof scheme, all right.
It wasn`t very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected;
when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves.
What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?
- Hey, how you doin`?
- How you doin`?
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?
Oh, Nicky.
I thought you was layin`.
No, no, I`m takin`.
I was takin`.
- You sure?
- I`m positive.
- I`m a little confused.
- You`re a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fuckin` face through this window... you`ll get unconfused.
- Gimme the fuckin` money.
- I`m sorry, Nick.
I didn`t mean anything by it.
That`s why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin` layin` it?
- My fuckin` head.
- Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president.
George Washington was born--
[ Ace ] But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town... like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
Beautiful, you got a beautiful swing.
[ Nicky ] Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved in Little League.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches... was a fuckin` metro intelligence cop.
But it didn`t matter.
It was all about the kids.
He`s gotta realize that everything can`t be a home run that he does.
That`s exactly what I keep tellin` him... but that`s the kind of kid he is.
[ Ace ] And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
[ Nicky ] Me, that`s why the bosses sent me out here.
They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fuckin` balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of 200 fuckin` grand...
- yeah, right, I`m sure.
- Hey!
How are you?
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I`m over here now.
- You`re over here?
- Yeah, I`m over here with them.
We`re waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we`re looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase and then he left.
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?
He`s gone?
He`s not here?
Carmine`s out?
I think maybe he went across the street... or somewhere else or somethin`.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- Yeah, lots of luck.
- Yeah, good luck to you too.
- Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.
Yeah, they don`t need those anymore.
[ Ace ] Guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
`Cause they`re the morons who give you the most trouble.
Even after we`d catch them, they`d try sneaking back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy, he`s bettin` lavender chips... at 500 each with only one little problem... he`s always guessed right.
If he wasn`t so fuckin` greedy, he`d have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they`re all greedy.
÷ I got a feelin` about the future ÷
÷ And it ain`t too good I know that ÷
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn`t in on it.
He just wasn`t protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Now, here`s this guy reading the dealer`s hole card... and signaling his buddy at this table.
[ Electronic Beeping ]
And that`s just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away.
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
÷ Happy birthday to you ÷
÷ Happy birthday to you ÷
÷ Happy birthday, dear Jeff ÷
÷ Happy birthday to you ÷
[ Groans ]
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He`s fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
[ Ace ] They never know what hit them.
And if and when they do find out... that they just got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fuckin` pals... they were knocking this place dead for years.
- He`s got a wire on him.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There it is.
That`s it.
- Cheater`s justice.
- Oh, God!
No, no, no!
[ Ace ] I wanted everybody to know... that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks... that the party was over.
I`m just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks... with your right hand.
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.
- You can`t do it with both hands?
- No, sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I never tried.
- So, you`re a righty.
- Yeah.
[ Screams ]
[ Groans ]
Now you`re gonna have to learn with your left hand.
- It`s 100, 110, I think.
- Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hiya.
That`s a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don`t I take him... over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
And by the way... send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
- Sure will.
- Real special.
- By the way, I`m Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
- Hi.
- Having a good time?
- Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
All right, I`m gonna give you a choice:
You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here.
- What do you want?
- I just wanna get out of here.
And don`t forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
- I`m sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You`re fuckin` right you made a bad mistake.
`Cause if you come back here, and we catch either one of you... we`re gonna break your heads, and you won`t walk out of here.
You see that fuckin` saw?
We`re gonna use it.
You got it?
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.
Throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car.
[ Ace ] Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters... the per was way up, the gods were happy.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We`re not gettin` any younger.
Don`t you think it`s time?
Aren`t you gettin` tired of all this shit?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I`m gonna do you one better.
I`m tryin` to marry you.
You wanna marry me?
I`m serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I`d be a good father, you`d be a good mother.
You don`t know me.
You`ve known me two, three months.
I`m 43 years old.
I don`t want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you.
And I can`t think of anybody better to be with.
And I don`t feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam?
`Cause I don`t.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, okay.
But I just don`t have those kind of feelings for you.
I`m sorry.
I`m not in love with you.
- All right, all right.
- Understand?
Sam, I`m sorry.
No, I-
- I--
I mean-
- I can grow.
As long as there`s a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I`m realistic.
I can accept that.
What is love anyway?
It`s a mutual respect.
It`s a devotion.
It`s a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn`t work out, doesn`t play out... then what happens to me?
You know I`m doing well now, and I`m gonna do even better.
And so whatever happens... if it doesn`t work out between us...
I`m gonna make sure you`re okay for the rest of your life.
And if there are kids, especially...
I`ll take care of you better than you`d ever imagine.
What are you pitching me?
Just what I said, you`ll be set up... for the rest of your life, that I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
[ Applause ]
[ Ace ] When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories.
But I didn`t give a fuck.
I`m Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
[ Nicky ] It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town, and he knew they`d show.
Because he knew they all wanted somethin` from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride, even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby before they could get married.
He even made Jenny and me watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
But I didn`t mind, we loved the kid.
[ Lester ] Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don`t make me come there.
Answer me.
[ Ginger Crying ] I love you.
But, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
[ Lester ] That`s right.
So it`s going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
You do?
Yeah, I do.
It`s the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you`re gonna be situated just right, in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I`m always gonna be here for you.
I ain`t going no place.
I`m lookin` at you right now.
I`m seein` you for the very first time, right this minute.
I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you, that`s what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I`m not crying.
[ Sniffles ]
Maybe you shouldn`t drink so much.
I`m okay, I just--
[ Sniffles ]
You just have to understand.
I`ve been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
I just-
- I don`t--
I think I have a right to do that.
Okay?
It`s all right.
That part of your life is over with.
- Right?
- Yeah.
You`re with me now.
- Yeah.
- Right?
Uh-huh.
- You`re sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Let`s go.
Let`s go back in.
- Okay.
Oh!
[ Ginger ] Tsk.
It`s great.
It`s great.
[ Ginger Shrieks ]
It`s all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can`t--
Try it on.
It`s yours.
You`re kidding.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
It`s chinchilla.
Oh, it`s so soft.
Nice, isn`t it?
No one`s ever been so nice to me.
[ Gasps ]
Oh!
Oh, my God!
So, do you think it`s too much... if I wear these all on the same day?
You do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
So wonderful.
The jewelry`s not so bad either.
We shouldn`t keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
- What I`m gonna tell you is very important.
- Okay.
All this stuff doesn`t mean anything.
Money, this doesn`t mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
[ Ace ] With over a million in cash and jewels... tucked in a bank in Vegas, only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don`t take checks.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
So I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank... under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
[ Ginger Laughs ]
And since I`d either be in jail or locked in a closet.... when I needed the money the most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
- ÷ I`ll take you there ÷ - ÷ I`m callin`, callin` ÷
÷ Callin` for mercy ÷
- ÷ I`ll take you there ÷ - ÷ Mercy, mercy ÷
÷ I`ll take you there ÷
This is a signature card.
So once she signs those papers, she`ll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
That`s right.
That`s the way you wanted it.
[ Banker ] Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Yeah, sure I do.
Why?
It`s good.
It`s just unusual.
Tell you the truth, so many of my clients don`t.
- ÷ Let me take you there ÷ - ÷ I`ll take you there ÷
- ÷ Ain`t no smilin` faces ÷ - ÷ I`ll take you there ÷÷
÷ Never will I know happiness ÷
[ Ace ] With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
And to play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a license.
I mean Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming his own kind of Vegas.
[ Nicky ] I put money out on the street chargin` three points a week.
- Don`t make us come lookin` for you.
- Juice to the fuckin` dealers.
You won`t have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, I started bustin` out high-stakes poker players.
[ Ace ] It was so obvious.
- All of Nicky`s half-assed mechanics were signal-happy.
- I`m gonna open for 500.
[ Ace ] Signaling back and forth.
[ Poker Player ] Why you cryin` with two loaves of bread under your arm?
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
And I didn`t want any of those agents near my place.
- Four aces.
- I can`t believe this.
[ Poker Player ] lf I didn`t have bad luck, I wouldn`t have any luck.
I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky`s a made guy, and I`m not.
I can`t do that.
Be careful.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
So I`m lucky.
I`m not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You`ve been lucky all week.
They`re looking to nail you.
[ Nicky ] Ace was so fuckin` worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doin` out here in the first place.
A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin` ear...
"This is Las Vegas.
We`re supposed to be out here robbin`... you dumb fuckin` hebe."
I don`t give a shit who he`s connected to.
Tell him to take his fuckin` feet off the table.
What`s he think this is, a goddamned sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table?
Yeah, I would mind.
I`m having a bad night.
Fuckin` asshole won`t budge.
Call security.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
Wanna do me a favor?
Take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on.
Fuck you!
I want you to exit this guy off the premises... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you`re gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain`t goin` anywhere with you.
- Bullshit.
You`re outta here.
- Fuck you!
You know who you`re fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you`re fucking with?
Leave me alone!
[ Grunting ]
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
No, I didn`t know that.
But you know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?
- ls that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
- [ Grunting ]
[ Grunting Continues ] Come here.
Come here.
You go over there.
You apologize.
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get outta line again, I`ll smash your head so hard... you won`t be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fuckin` hick.
Sammy, listen.
This guy obviously doesn`t know who he was talking to.
He doesn`t know that we`re dear friends.
I mean, he`s already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...
I swear he`ll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he`s out for good.
I don`t care what it is, I`ll never let him in the place again.
I`m sorry about this, really.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kickin`, stinky-horse-manure-smellin` motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I`ll stick you in the desert.
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I`m sorry.
[ Roaring ]
÷ You`re dear to me Yes, sirree ÷
[ Nicky ] You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David and their tigers away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a Rolls-Royce.
But I`ll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fuckin` angles.
He brought over the whole "Femme Fatale" show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh `em in once a week to make sure they didn`t blow up like balloons.
She`s still eight pounds over.
- What`s the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.
Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?
I`m trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them--
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I guess she`s frightened. lf she doesn`t lose weight she may get fired.
That`s right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--
- It`s been our policy--
- Just stop everything!
- This woman`s an institution.
- That`s the problem.
She`s lazy.
[ Nicky ] Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So, he took bookie joints off the street... and then opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years by doing all of this... he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off of him.
[ Ace ] Between my innovations... ÷ Look like they`re taking some cat to jail ÷ and Nicky`s dedication to his job... ÷ Steamboats are comin` and they`re splashing and goin` ÷
I soon had the best operation on the strip.
÷ Moon is shinin` on friends below ÷
You gotta watch yourself.
There`s a lot of heat on you already.
Why?
Somebody`s complainin`?
I`m hearing things from security.
The sheriff`s lookin` to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
They got two names from the whole country... and one of `em is still Al Capone.
If they put you in that book, you`re gonna be in trouble.
You will not be able to walk into a casino.
I`m trying to make a living, that`s all.
I`m just tellin` you.
Don`t say I didn`t warn you.
All right.
[ Man ] Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
[ Chattering ]
[ Man ] For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it`s my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
[ Applause ]
[ Ace ] Back home, they would`ve put me in jail for what I`m doing.
But out here, they`re giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... for charitable donations to greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we`ve ever raised before.
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife, Ginger, work the room.
- [ Chattering ]
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You`ve got to bring Amy to Sasha`s birthday party.
We`d love to have you there.
- Yes, okay.
- Great.
She made everybody feel good.
÷ That`s Stella by starlight ÷
Congratulations, Sam.
Oh, thanks.
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
- Hi.
You`re one of the most gorgeous women I`ve ever seen.
You`re a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fuckin` kid!
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!
they didn`t know what really moved her.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Daddy gave me this--
And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin` back there?
You can`t even see `em there.
- Okay, I`ll--
- What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
- Well--
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.
- The action is in the front.
Bring `em up front.
- All right, I will.
Listen to me very carefully.
There are three ways of doing things around here:
the right way, the wrong way and the way that I do it.
- You understand?
- I do understand that.
I`ll get right on it.
- And thank you.
- Don`t thank me.
Just do it.
You`re the slots manager.
I shouldn`t have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right, Mr. Rothstein.
I am so sorry.
[ Ace ] So I ended up working-- what, 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
[ Chuckles ] Well, you might as well get something out of it.
[ Ace ] Well, it wasn`t long... before what I was afraid was gonna happen happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas.
And from then on, I couldn`t be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"He will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000... every time he shows up."
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it.
You got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation--"
Motherfucker!
ls there any way around this?
No, there`s no way.
Let`s say, for instance...
I wanna go in a restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can`t even set foot in the parking lot.
That`s how serious it is.
In other words, I`m fucked?
In so many words, yes.
It just didn`t sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and fbi agent.
I mean, you`re listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn`t care.
I gotta do something.
They ain`t gettin` rid of me.
They`re not gettin` rid of me.
I`m stayin` here.
Fuck `em.
Fuck `em.
[ Nicky ] So, once they pulled that shit...
I started doin` my own things nobody ever thought of doin`.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados... and started knockin` over high-rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers-- anybody right here in town.
I had a good fuckin` crew goin` for me, I`ll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy.
He worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
And I opened up my own jewelry store too, the "Gold Rush."
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.
But I didn`t like the people I was rippin` off looking at me... so I used to turn their fuckin` pictures around.
- What`s takin` so long?
- This is a motherfucker!
- It`s working.
- Learn how to open these things so you don`t have to take `em.
Some of these stones got a lot of niggers in them.
Tell Pepe if he`s switching stones on us, he better take a camel back to Nigeria.
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Yeah?
- They`re in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?
- Yes.
Don`t worry.
- All right.
Thanks.
[ Ace ] He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen.
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.
- Valet parkers.
- They`re just checking in now.
Okay, I`ll tell him.
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.
- 1230.
Right.
- Secretaries.
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition?
All right.
And they all got a piece of the score.
Car`s coming.
÷÷ [ Hard Rock ]
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else... if not, they`d drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
[ Nicky ] What the fuck they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn`t I?
You know, this diamond has flaws in it.
- There`s no flaws.
- I`m doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there`s no flaws.
[ Nicky ] Whenever we got local merch... we`d usually send it to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
What, are you gonna have a fucking meeting here?
I know his language.
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.
Twenty thousand.
That`s my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let`s talk Turkey here.
Twenty-five thousand.
[ Nicky ] I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault... where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn`t leave it at the Gold Rush... in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn`t give a fuck.
She used to fall asleep on the couch watching TV.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn`t send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn`t, because I wasn`t even supposed to be doin` it.
The bosses were making so much fucking money with the casinos... that they didn`t want anybody makin` any waves for them.
You gave all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?
That`s why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came here.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet?
You have to understand, and I`m sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace`s banker.
You will try to push it through, won`t you, Mr. Clark?
- Yes.
- I`m giving you 50,000 cash.
Then I put some more money into legitimate places, like my restaurant.
- ls that the last one?
- Yeah.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Fuckers.
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.
Enjoy.
Have a good time.
Choke on it, motherfucker.
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin`?
[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with it.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over the place.
That show over at the Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said, whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.
[ Ace ] But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls, naturally.
I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star.
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.
- Hey, Shelly.
How are you?
- Hi.
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.
- This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.
Let`s check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
Come on.
I`ll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That`s the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days.
It`ll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
- That`s what I did.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?
You know you`re a lyin` lowlife, motherfuckin` gamblin` degenerate prick?
You know that`s what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fuckin` rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
Your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin` heat`s off.
And you didn`t gamble that fuckin` money?
- No?
You didn`t?
- I didn`t--
Don`t fuck with me, Al!
Don`t make a fuck outta me.
You wanna embarrass me and make a fool outta me?
You didn`t gamble?
Tell me you gambled the fuckin` money...
I`ll give you the fuckin` money to put the fuckin` heat on!
Did you gamble?
Huh?
Fuckin` degenerate.
Fuckin` kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck outta here.
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.
Let me find out you fucked up.
I`ll leave you where I find you.
How many of these you gonna eat?
- Two.
- Two?
[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning, when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?
- Not a lot.
You know why, right?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- `Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.
[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks, I used to send Marino... back to the bosses with a piece of what I made.
Not a bit piece, but what did they know?
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don`t know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.
The cops knew, but they didn`t give a fuck.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do...
I would carry things out to a "T."
Like the time Tony Dogs, who`s supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo`s bars.
Here`s a fuckin` guy kills two of Remo`s guys... and a poor fuckin` waitress who was just workin` on her night off, of all things.
I mean, this guy`s just beggin` to be made an example of.
Frankie, I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
And I don`t care what you have to do to `em to get `em, understand?
- I`ll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow `em down.
[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you, I had to admire this guy.
He was one of the toughest lrishmen I ever met.
- [ Chattering ]
- This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two fuckin` nights we beat the shit outta this guy.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
- Better give me a name soon, or I`m gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.
- But he never talked.
- I know you would`ve ratted by now.
In the end, I had to put his fuckin` head in a vise.
Dogs, Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.
I`ll squash your fuckin` head like a grapefruit if you don`t give me a name.
Don`t make me have to do this.
Please.
Come on!
Don`t make me be a bad guy.
Come on.
[ Straining ] Fuck you!
This motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fuckin` days and nights.
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
ls that what you`re tellin` me?
- [ Skull Crunching ]
- You motherfucker, you!
Huh?
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin` name!
[ Straining ] Charlie M.
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.
You make me pop your fuckin` eye outta your head... to protect that piece of shit, Charlie M.?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!
You motherfucker, you!
Frankie, do him a fuckin` favor.
[ Ace ] The word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
Charlie M.
[ Bells Ringing ]
Four reels, sevens, across three $15,000 jackpots.
Do you have any idea what the odds are?
It`s gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin` jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn`t you call me?
It happened so quick.
Three guys won.
I didn`t have a chance.
- You didn`t see the scam?
- There`s no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
They won!
It`s a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
Ward, you`re pissing me off.
Now you`re insulting my intelligence.
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin` reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it`s in the billions.
What`s the matter with you?
Didn`t you see you were being set up on the second win?
I think you`re overreacting.
Listen, you fuckin` yokel.
I`ve been carrying your ass ever since I got here.
- Get your ass outta here.
- You`re firing me?
I`m firing you.
No, I`m not firing--
- You might regret this.
- I`ll regret it if I keep you.
This is not the way to treat people.
If you didn`t know, you`re too fuckin` dumb.
If you did know, you were in on it.
Either way, you`re out.
Get out.
Come on.
Let`s go.
The guy`s history as far as I`m concerned.
But you can`t fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin` county commissioner or related to a commissioner.
This is his state.
His uncle`s chief judge.
His brother-in-law runs the county commission.
You`re in the finances, you`re upstairs.
But you are not on the floor.
You don`t see what`s going on.
I`ve got thousands of players.
I`ve got 500 dealers.
They`re all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I`m watching all the details all the time.
There is not one single thing I will not catch.
- Look at yours.
Look at that.
- Huh?
Look at this.
There`s nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
What are you talking about?
If you don`t do it yourself, it never gets done.
- Where are you going?
- ÷ How long can this go on ÷
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that`s going to take?
I don`t care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?
Wanna come to Mommy?
It`s all right, sweetheart.
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
- What do you need?
- Got her?
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don`t you take it out of your account?
I would, you know, Sam, it`s just that--
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?
What`s the difference?
I just need it.
Well, I gotta ask you.
That`s a lot of money.
You`re not asking for a box of popcorn.
We don`t have to turn this into a big deal.
Okay?
We don`t have to have a fight.
It`s important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.
Who`s fighting?
I mean, tell me what it`s for.
Why can`t you tell me what it`s for?
Huh?
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for 25,000.
What do you want, a coat?
- No.
- lf you want a coat, you got it.
It`s not the money.
It`s just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
Sam, I`ve been independent my whole life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
- Now you`re making me beg.
- What are you talking about?
And you`re embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?
You`re asking me for 25,000.
I`m not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
You know, it`s about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
Can I trust you?
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you could tell me what the money is for.
÷ You`ve got to ÷
÷ Give a little ÷
÷ Take a little ÷
÷ And let your poor heart ÷
÷ Break a little ÷
Yeah, she`s leaving the bank now.
All right, I`m gonna follow her.
[ Man Laughing ] What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
It means I got the money.
÷ You`ve got to ÷
- ÷ Give a little ÷ - [ Singer ] Yes, you`re way up on top now.
÷ Take a little ÷÷
How are you doin`, Les?
It`s Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren`t you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
If I`m wrong, please correct me.
`Cause I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine too.
Go ahead.
Take it.
`Cause you already have hers.
She`s my wife.
Look at me.
You did know that, didn`t you?
You knew that she`s my wife?
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah, I know that.
You know, yeah?
But if you ever come back again, ever... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man.
Don`t be a fucking pimp.
Now, you wanna do me a favor?
Get outta here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get up and get outta here.
- [ Singer ] And you want to be free.
- ÷ Take a little ÷
[ Singer ] Why, you feel that you are too good... much too good for a nobody like me.
- Fuckin` piece of shit.
- That`s fuckin` bullshit.
- ÷ That`s the story ÷
- Well, darling, I guess it`s best...
- ÷ That`s the glory of love ÷ - that we should part.
Remember when you called him that night and said good-bye?
He didn`t say, "Don`t get married.
I`ll be right down."
- He didn`t say that to you, did he?
- No, he didn`t.
No. lnstead, what did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he`s got."
Come here.
I want to show you something.
- ÷ That`s the story ÷
- The second letter came right after I gave you your start.
- [ Grunting, Shouting ]
- No!
No!
No!
[ Screaming ] No!
Make `em stop it!
- [ Groaning ]
- No!
No!
It`s not his fault!
It`s my fault!
[ Shouting Continues ]
[ Screaming ] No!
- Fuck!
Fuck!
- Piece of shit.
[ Sobbing Continues ]
[ Lester ] Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He`s such a prick!
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn`t want to do it himself.
Oh, no, he didn`t want to get his own hands dirty.
So why did he have to do that, huh?
Tell me.
- I know it wasn`t a nice thing to do--
- No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn`t know if this guy is shaking you down--
No.
No.
I told him all about this guy before we ever got married.
- This is no fucking surprise.
- Oh, you did?
I didn`t know that.
He`s just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
You know, the first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
I mean, I know he`s a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he`s crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open, you know.
I knew the bottom could drop out at any time.
You don`t think I`m gonna go into a situation like this... if I don`t think I`m gonna get covered on the back end.
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?
So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.
You mean like a lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I`m just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I`m told it`s worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?
A million dollars in jewelry.
Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you?
I should`ve never married him.
He`s a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can`t trust a snake.
[ Sniffling ] I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
You know, this is probably not-- I don`t have the answers anyway.
- This is probably not what you want to hear...
- I do.
`cause you`re a little upset, and I understand that.
But I think you should try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could`ve killed him!
Okay?
He could`ve killed him.
He didn`t have to hit him.
It`s not like I`m sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What is that all about?
I guess it`s `cause he loves you so much, he`s jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do.
Look, I`ll try to find out what the hell is going on.
- When I see him, I`ll talk to him.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You`re a beautiful girl.
I`ve seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this.
You`re so nice.
Come on, now.
I don`t wanna see you unhappy.
- ÷ These eyes before us ÷
- Thanks.
÷ Just what the truth is ÷
- Thank you.
- It`s all right.
÷ I can`t say anymore ÷
÷ `Cause I love you ÷
÷ Yes, I love you-- ÷÷
[ Phone Ringing ]
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?
Uh, no.
No, thank you, little lady.
Okay, send him in.
Then call me four minutes after.
- Mr. Rothstein, I`m Pat Webb.
- How do you do?
- Hey, it is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin` well.
Hey, all that money is rollin` in.
I appreciate you takin` the time to see a poor civil servant.
- Why don`t you have a seat, hmm?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I come here personally to kind of smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
See, uh, maybe you didn`t know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He`s got lots of friends.
Nice family and their money go back many, many years.
Now friends vote.
Family and money votes.
That`s important to me and you.
And if you`ll think about our little problem along them lines-- and you`ll forgive me for sayin` it-- maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
I`m sorry, but he knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
That means, either he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was goin` on.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Are, uh-- [ Clears Throat ]
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.
I think you`re way out of line talking to me like that.
What you`re saying is libelous, and you`re in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be very helpful to that kid.
He`s weak.
He`s incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.
There`s not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
[ Chuckles ]
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
[ Coughs ] But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favor... if you`d think some more on hirin` him back.
I can`t do that.
I appreciate the fact that he`s your brother-in-law... and I do want to help you and I like to do favors.
I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I`m sorry.
I can`t do anything.
He`s too incompetent, and the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
[ Phone Ringing ]
Okay.
Thanks.
Well... you know, that`s it.
I`m sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You`re all just our guests.
But you act like you`re at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain`t home.
But that`s where we`re gonna send you if it harelips the governor.
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- You bet.
What happened to my pills?
Huh?
lsn`t it bad enough you`re drinking too much?
You`re taking my pills too?
I didn`t take your pills.
Look, for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these.
And that`s when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with `em?
[ Crying ] You didn`t have to beat him up.
What?
I was just trying to help him.
Like I`m sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
You can`t make me stop caring about people.
What?
What?
I said, you can`t make me... stop caring about people.
[ Crying Continues ]
Listen...
Ginger...
I`m trying to make the best of everything here, you know?
I mean, you`re my wife, for Christ`s sakes.
I mean, people look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don`t give a shit!
I`m gettin` out of here.
I am.
[ Crying Continues ]
Come over here.
You gotta get hold of yourself.
- Okay.
Okay.
- lf not for me, at least for Amy.
Understand?
Your drinking`s gettin` way out of hand.
I`m gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
- I don`t need one.
- Yes, you do.
It`s very discreet.
There`s no names in the papers.
That`s all you care about.
You don`t care about me.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don`t.
How could you say that?
You`re a beautiful woman.
You`re destroying yourself.
You don`t need that fuckin` leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You`re a tiger.
You`re stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You`re gonna do it.
Okay?
You`ll do it.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Okay.
I`ll try.
I`ll try.
I`ll try.
I will.
Don`t be mad at me, okay?
I will.
[ Crying Continues ]
[ Nicky ] No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rollin` in... and the suitcases kept comin` and goin`.
And let me tell you, the fuckin` bottom line here is... cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin` a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we`re robbing is being robbed?
Somebody`s robbing from us?
We go through all this trouble and somebody`s robbing us?
Huh?
Like I said, it`s part of the business.
It`s considered leakage.
Leakage my balls.
I want the guy who`s robbing us.
[ Nicky ] Even John Nash-- that`s the guy who ran the scam-- he knew there wasn`t much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he`s gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don`t it?
Try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that.
What`s the point of skimming if we`re being skimmed?
It defeats the purpose.
Huh?
They take this money because they`re my guys, so give `em some leeway.
[ Nicky ] But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K.C.... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
- What were you doin`?
- I was with my cumma.
- What are you doin` with your cumma?
- I gave her a scheff.
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
- What you been doin`?
- I`m out there more than I`m here.
And little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they`d would`ve been better off makin` fuckin` novena.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
- I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
- What expenses?
I`m layin` money outta my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I`m gonna start keepin` records.
No records, Artie.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I keep layin` out my own fuckin` dough.
What the hell are we doin` over here?
You`re goin` to Las Vegas at my expense.
Oh, fuck.
I mean, after all--
[ Ace ] No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next.
- I can`t believe you`re doing this.
- We made a deal.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr. Integrity... had a partner nobody knew about.
And when she showed up and started demanding money--
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you`re wrong.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.
Green tried to stonewall her.
I will see to it that you do not get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its president, Phil Green.
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.
I believe he was fair, and I`m delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn`t go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
Hey, that`s not good.
[ Nicky ] She was doin` pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start countin` her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
Can you comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
- What are you talking about?
- She was found last night shot in the head.
Was this just a real estate partnership?
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
Did you ever hear of the .22
Caliber Killer?
[ Ace ] Now, instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green`s here about two or three times a month... and he`s busy with real estate deals.
So in Green`s absence, then, you`re the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you`re the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
Hmm, have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties... says that he is the real boss of the $100 million...
Tangiers casino empire."
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he said that.
It`s right here.
Has that man even filed for his license yet?
I don`t know.
We have to check the files.
Without gettin` your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And kinda check closely, `cause we may have to kick a kike`s ass outta town.
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation... of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein`s application... for a gaming license is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino--
[ Muted ]
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Hello?
- I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?
- You can`t.
- You gotta make a reservation.
It`s all booked up.
- No, no.
It`s impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.
It`s very difficult to get in.
I`ll use the service entrance.
I`ll see you at 9:00.
All right.
The battle between State gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace Rothstein`s attempt to get state licensing... despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein`s organized crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein`s friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?
- Why don`t you take it easy on that stuff?
Huh?
- [ Newscaster Continues ]
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We`re talking about some stuff.
At 6:00:
Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
- Go down.
Just... go downst- - [ Newscaster Continues ]
You can`t let this concern you, Ace.
Don`t worry.
It`s just a political witch hunt.
Ace.
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.
No.
Hey, Mr. Clark.
I`ve been tryin` to reach you.
- You`re tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I`ve been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
[ Laughing ] What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
- [ Laughing ]
- You know, I think you`ve gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I`ll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and, uh, if you don`t have my money for me...
I`ll crack your fuckin` head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I`m comin` out of jail... hopefully you`ll be comin` out of your coma.
And guess what?
I`ll split your fuckin` head open again.
`Cause I`m fuckin` stupid.
I don`t give a fuck about jail.
That`s my business.
That`s what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
- You can`t talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat lrish prick!
You put my money to sleep!
- Get my money, or I`ll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I`ll be there in the morning.
You can try me, Fatso.
You fuckin` try me.
You think he got the point?
What`re you doin`?
He`s a square guy, for chrissakes.
He`s gonna run to the F.B.I.
That prick`s been dodgin` me for three weeks.
You`re tryin` to tell me what to do.
I`m not tryin` to tell you what to do.
You`re outta line.
Where`s your head?
Where`s my head?
Where`s your fuckin` balls?
I`m tryin` to put somethin` big together here.
You know what I`m talkin` about.
If you`re actin` like this now, can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me, you`re gonna have to go my way.
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I`m responsible for thousands of people.
I got a hundred million a year goin` through the place.
It`s all over if I don`t get that license.
If it goes bad for me, it`s bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fuckin` license.
I plant my own flag, you ain`t gonna need a license.
You know, I don`t know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don`t want to go along with me.
- No, I don`t want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.
I don`t want to be involved in anything you`re talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.
I want everything quiet.
That`s it!
Quiet like this?
"I`m the boss"?
That`s quiet?
That`s taken out of context.
I had no control over that.
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you`re on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?
- What happened to you?
You lost control.
- I lost control?
Look at you, you`re fuckin` walkin` around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fuckin` cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don`t wanna bring this up, but you been treatin` people with disrespect, even your wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin` Lester Diamond incident.
You`re the shoulder to cry on?
Did you her tell about your little role in that situation?
No, that`s not the fuckin` point.
- The point is, she`s upset, and you`ve got a problem.
- I would appreciate it... if you stay out of my personal life.
- You wouldn`t like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?
- Stay away from her.
It`s none of your business.
- It`s none of my business?
A week ago it was.
Now it`s none of my business.
When you need me, you need me.
The way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I`m gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy is gonna run to the F.B.I. now.
Your head`s bigger than your casino.
[ Ace Narrating ] I knew what he wanted.
Nicky wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
Plus, he had stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
[ Gunshot ]
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
- [ Explosions ]
- They questioned Nicky.
When some guys that didn`t pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky`s name was in every one of those newspapers.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
[ Nicky Narrating ] The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You`re gonna get runned over, there.
If a guy fuckin` tripped over a banana peel, they`d bring me in for it.
Come on, be nice, huh?
And the bosses were no better.
They complained because things don`t run smooth.
In my line of work, things don`t run so smooth.
I`m sorry.
I`m dealin` with degenerate animals out here.
But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They`re sittin` on their asses drinkin` anisette.
I`m the guy in the trenches.
Fuckin` bosses think it`s a fuckin` free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy`s head in the desert.
You know about that?
- Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Everybody`s talkin`.
They`re makin` a big deal out of it.
It`s in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
And I mean, that`s no good.
You gotta tell him to take care of things a little better.
I`ll tell him, Remo.
[ Nicky Narrating ] Fuckin` bosses;
they`re smokin` their Di Nobilis... and they`re eatin` trippa and fuckin` suffritte, you know, fried pigs` guts.
If I want to talk private, I gotta go to a bus stop.
- What do they care long as I keep sendin` money back?
- They`re complainin`.
Let `em complain.
I`m the one who`s here.
I do all the work.
- Somebody don`t like it, fuck `em.
- It`s up to you.
They want a fuckin` war?
I`m ready.
All I gotta do is take care of five of those guys.
The rest will fall into place.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
[ Ace Narrating ] Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me too.
The F.B.I. watched every move he made, but he didn`t care.
He just didn`t care.
[ Nicky Narrating ] If they`re gonna watch me, I`m gonna watch `em right back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-buggin` equipment from the same places that sell to the fuckin` C.I.A.
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I. de-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.
And because of that, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doin` anything.
[ Ace Narrating ] I got my job on the line, and this guy`s havin` the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watchin` him, and he`s out playin` golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up, and I didn`t want to leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can`t work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You`ve been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.
That`s gonna mean something when you go before the commission.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.
- All right, well, we`ll move on to-- - [ Airplane Engine Sputtering ]
- [ Engine Sputtering ]
- I wanted to hear something about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
[ Engine Sputtering ]
Where`s this guy gonna land, the fairway?
They`re fuckin` agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
[ Ace Narrating ] The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the Control Board.
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.
And as if things weren`t bad enough, in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they bought the suitcases.
Fightin` over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and it`s gonna cost me another couple grand.
[ Ace Narrating ] He ran it with his brother-in-law... but mostly what he did was complain about his trips to Vegas.
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise they`re gonna make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fuckin` nickel goes down.
Receipts--
- Hey, oh, wha-- What`s the matter with you?
- Everything`s here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I`m sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I`ll tell him I`ll take the eyes out of his frickin` head.
- Again.
- I said, "frickin` head."
- That`s enough.
- I`m sorry.
[ Ace Narrating ] What happens next?
You can`t believe it.
Who would believe that the F.B.I. had a wire in the place... lookin` for some information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked-out God knows when over God knows what.
What`s to prevent him with the suitcases that he could take what he wants?
Fuckin` Nance takes back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We`ve got nobody in the room to watch.
That`s the law.
We can`t even go into the count room to watch our money.
You believe this bullshit?
Sure, he`s got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together, those fucks.
I`ll find out.
If it`s Green, I`ll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag.
I don`t.
- I`ll hit the two of them with a fuckin` shovel.
- Take it easy.
Ma, I`m sorry.
They`re beatin` me left and right.
- Ma, I`m sorry.
I`m all upset.
- I know, but that`s enough.
You know what they`re doin`.
I can`t take this no more.
Back and forth.
- Take it easy.
You`ll get a heart attack like that.
- I know.
I`m too upset.
[ Ace Narrating ] And the damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas and the casinos and suitcases... and that`s it.
[ Piscano Shouting ]
Everything`s comin` outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.
[ Ace Narrating ] Would you believe that such a thing could happen?
[ Piscano ] I`m in this to make money, not to lose money.
[ Ace Narrating ] Every F.B.I. man across the country had their ears open now.
[ Piscano ] If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
[ Ace Narrating ] I mean, Piscano, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
[ Piscano`s Mother ] There are some that are good and some that are bad.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
[ Ace Narrating ] When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired F.B.I. agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counselor, before you continue--
- I want to have this marked--
This commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean, "Adjourned"?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn`t even look at the F.B.I. reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest?
I never comped you?
- I don`t comp you at least three times a month?
- I`d like to answer that.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He`s lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was with Barney Greenstein.
- Was I at that dinner?
Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.
- Was I at that dinner?
Was I?
- You were wandering.
- You were... in the-- You were in the building.
- I was in the building?
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Did you not?
Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
You son of a--
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...
- What are you runnin` for, Bob?
- accused the state`s top gaming officials of corruption.
You promised me when you were getting comped at my hotel.
You were asking me for copies of your bill so you could put `em on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...
- Bullshit!
Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
But you guys think you have the right to pass judgment!
[ Newscaster ] Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license... yesterday`s hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein`s history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
[ Ace ] Fuckin` hypocrites!
- What the hell`s he gonna do now?
- I don`t know.
What`s he doin`?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What`s the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
What are we gonna do?
However he runs things, it`s gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he`s a janitor.
I don`t give a shit.
But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it`s something quiet.

Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.

Tonight, taped live from the all-new Sports Book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America;
a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
- Mr. Sam Rothstein.
- [ Applause ]
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.
We`re very happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy, who is... a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
- [ Applauding ]
- Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
- Keep an eye on him.
- [ Avalon ] I`ve got a large family.
- How many kids do you have?
- I`m very proud to say that we have eight children.
- [ Applauding ] - [ Avalon ] No, no, please.
Please.
- That`s amazing.
- There`s nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
- Ace, don`t do it.
- ÷÷ [ Rimsky-Korsakov, "Flight Of The Bumblebee" ]
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jesus.
He`s juggling!
[ Ace ] Let`s not take Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don`t have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
[ Stone ] What the hell is he doin` on television, anyway?
He`s on all night, screamin` about how he`s gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He`s gonna go to Washington with this?
He`s out of his fuckin` mind.
It`s a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it`s time he should quit.
[ Ace ] First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
We`re on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States.
These guys don`t give a fuck about the Supreme Court.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can`t be serious.
How can I walk away?
Don`t you see what`s at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that`s like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
He pissed `em off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
- What are you proposing?
- I don`t know.
He doesn`t listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for awhile.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain`t sendin` Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break... it would give everybody time to maneuver.
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.
[ Sighs ]
I can`t do that.
[ Ace Narrating ] As soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
Great.
You know, I`ve got to do some shopping.
You want to go?
[ Ace Narrating ] Getting a call from Nicky wasn`t easy.
Even the codes didn`t work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone`s tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
So on routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
[ Ginger ] Yeah, I got a sprained fuckin` elbow.
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar`s?
- 100 yards down the road.
- Why?
- Don`t ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit.
[ Laughs ] I saw something.
Something very cute.
[ F.B.I. Agent ] Okay, he`s out.
It`s the ant.
Brown unit.
And he`s with the bogey.
I think it`s Frankie.
[ Ace Narrating ] Nicky started out before me... because it wasn`t that easy for him to get around.
Nicky couldn`t even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.

[ Ace Narrating ] Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous.
It`s a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of comin` back alive... from a meetin` with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
Where the fuck you get off talkin` to people behind my back, goin` over my head?
- What people?
- What people?
What`d you think, I wasn`t gonna find out?
I don`t even know what you`re talkin` about.
You said I`m bringin` heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of your shit?
You`re orderin` me out?
You better get your own fuckin` army, pal!
I didn`t order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin` town?
- Yeah.
Let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it`s my ass.
It`s not yours.
It`s my ass.
I don`t know whether you know you have your fuckin` casino because I made that possible!
I`m what counts out here.
Not your fuckin` country clubs or your fuckin` TV shows!
And what the fuck are you doin` on TV anyhow?
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I`m only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You understand.
You could have had the food-and-beverage job without goin` on television!
You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
They know they can`t fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
That`s right.
You`re makin` a spectacle of yourself.
Me?
I wouldn`t even be in this situation if it wasn`t for you.
Every time I meet somebody, the question is:
Do I know you?
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin` license on me.
- No, Nicky.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
Do you remember?
- Back up a fuckin` minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you!
You only exist out here because of me!
That`s the only reason!
Without me, you personally--
Every fuckin` wise guy still around will take a piece of your fuckin` Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You`re fuckin` warned.
Don`t go over my head again, you motherfucker, you!

Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out we didn`t know who he was.
He`s over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.
- Now he`s really pissed.
- Oh, no.
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.
That`s it.
I`ll be right down.
- He`s gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000.

What the fuck you keep lookin` at him for?
You fuckin`-
- Look at this, 20 fuckin` paints in a row.
Hit me again.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.
I`m here to help you.
You`re gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
Give me the fuckin` money.
- I`m gonna okay you ten.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
Ten and that`s it.
What are you starin` at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on, come on.
Let`s get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin`.
Deal.
[ Man ] Everything`s changed now.
You`re talking about a divorce.
You`re asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She`s only sober about two hours a day.
It`s usually from 11:00 in the morning `til 1:00 in the afternoon.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she`s gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Comin` right back to me...
- or findin` some other excuse to come--
- We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn`t work out between us, I could get my things, and I could leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look-Look in my eyes.
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won`t happen.
[ Ace Narrating ] And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life... a home, a kid.
That`s not what happened.
It didn`t work out that way.
- Everything all right?
- [ Ace Continues ] I mean, what could we do?
After a while, we`d just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.
- [ Operator ] Beverly Hotel.
- [ Ace ] Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.
[ Hangs Up Receiver ]
[ Phone Ringing ]
Hello.
Yeah.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.
My daughter is with them, and I think they`re gonna try and kidnap her.
- ls there anybody you can send?
- We`ll take care of it.
[ Doorbell Rings ]
We got a number and an address.
- Hello. ls this Lester?
- Hello.
Who`s calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
Put her on the phone.
She`s not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
- I know she`s there.
Don`t fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn`t.
- [ Lester Snaps Fingers ]
- You shouldn`t do this.
- [ Snapping Fingers ] - [ Ace ] You understand?
Put her on the fuckin` phone.
Sam, I don`t know where she is.
[ Lester Stammering ] So...
listen-- Can I call you back?
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.
- Okay, I`ll call you right back.
- Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
You want to get back at this prick?
Hmm?
- Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?
- [ Snorts ]
Hey, you got a minute?
He`s got two million in the box, am I right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.
Huh?
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don`t want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man."
We`re going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
You`re the mother.
How much you think he`ll pay to get this kid back?
- I don`t want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth.
You know where she gets this?
- You shut up.
- [ Diamond ] You want me to come over there?
I`ll smack your face.
Don`t give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we`re going.
- Lester, he called you here.
He called you right here.
- That`s who was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he`s sending some guys over here, probably right now.
It means he`s sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He`s sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.
What do you think we`re gonna do?
He`s probably got guys outside the fuckin` house!
- This is fuckin` bullshit!
This is bullshit!
- Get your bag!
Let`s go!
- Oh, what bullshit?
What?
You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin`?
- Go, go!
Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.
Just relax.
Nobody`s killing anybody.
- [ Ginger Babbling ] I think he`s gonna kill me.
- Just relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I`ll see what I can do.
I`m gonna call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you`re gonna be there, right?
- I`ll be here.
Listen, don`t do anything else crazy, okay?
You all right?
Okay.
Bye.
- Just knock it off.
You two knock it off.
- She started it.
- She started the whole thing.
I`m just standing here.
- Get in the car.
You`re not gonna drive.
Don`t even think you`re gonna drive.
I`m gonna drive.
- I`m not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You`re driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
And I`m sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we--

÷ You can go your own way ÷
[ Volume Decreases ] ÷ Go your own way ÷
÷ Tell me why ÷

- Ginger called me.
- ÷÷ [ Continues ]
- Yeah.
- I just told you she called me.
- What`d she want?
She was afraid to call you.
- She`s with that cocksucker.
They got Amy.
- That`s why I`m here.
She wants to come back, but she`s afraid you`re gonna whack her out.
- They`re gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
- I know.
Why didn`t you come to me?
I mean, this is family.
It ain`t business.
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
You know what I mean?
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she`s gone anyway.
- Am I right?
- [ Sighs ]
What am I going to do with this woman?
- Driving me fuckin` crazy.
- I think if you, uh... assure her that she`s gonna be all right, she`ll come back.
Driving me fuckin` crazy.
Once you get her here, you think about it.
Wait `til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That`s the main thing here.
You want your kid, don`t you?
Huh?
- [ Rings ] - [ Ace ] Hello.
Hi, it`s me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I`m not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane, any plane, to get her here right away.
- That`s all I`m asking.
- Do you--
I mean, I don`t think she should go by herself.
[ Sighs ] What do you mean?
[ Crying ] What I mean is--
Do you think if I came back--
Do you think you could forgive me?
[ Sighs ] I gotta tell you, I don`t know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where`s the box?
- I gotta tell ya...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
- What`s it under?
- Pretty serious.
- How serious?
- [ Sniffling ] It`s under 25.
- It`s under 25,000?
- Yeah.
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That`s okay.
He got his 25.
That I`ll live with.
Any more, I couldn`t.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I`ll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what`d you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch too.
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Good evening, signora.
This way.
- Geno.
[ Ace Narrating ] The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?
That doesn`t make much sense.
First of all, he`s not gonna wear thousand-dollar suits.
Let`s say he did, which he won`t.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
- ÷ I`m confessin` ÷
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can`t get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice--
He doesn`t know what the fuck a good watch is.
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.
at the most, which is impossible, for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, 1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
- I`m just trying to figure it out.
- There`s nothing to figure out.
I`m home.
We`re working it out.
I`ve been told before, "We`re working it out."
You think that you`re home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?
So, counting the watch, let`s say another 4,000... for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That`s for sure.
I know that fuckin` piece of shit had a good fuckin` time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You`re lookin` at me a certain way.
You`re teary-eyed, huh?
You`re upset.
You`re a good actress, you know that?
Good fuckin` actress.
You can fuckin` get that pity out of people.
I`m not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I`m not.
And I`m not a sucker.
That fuckin` pimp cocksucker.
He`s lucky I didn`t kill him last time.
Lucky he`s fuckin` livin`.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you would have ran away, he would have been fuckin` dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
÷ Dreamin` dreams of you Little babe ÷÷
[ Ginger Whispering ] No, it isn`t right.
It isn`t fair.
[ Whispering Continues ]
Yes.
He doesn`t come home at night.
What is the big fuckin` deal?
I go-
- Listen, I just can`t fuckin` take it.
Why should I fuckin` take it?
That wasn`t the deal.
He acts like I`m the only one around here with a fuckin` past.
He`ll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I`ve tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I`m not.
I want to have him killed.
Yes, I want him killed.
I`ve fuckin` had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
- Hello.
- [ Gasping ] Yes, I do!
I fuckin` hate you!
I can`t take it anymore!
- Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fuckin` guts!
- You hate my guts?
- I`m sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!
- Come with me now.
Come with me now.
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Screams ]
- I want you out.
I want you out of here.
- [ Continues Screaming ]
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin` bag and get out of here!
I`ll go, but I want my money right now!
- You`ll get your money!
Don`t worry.
- The arrangement is over.
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.
I need some cash right now!
You can`t just put me in the street!
You haven`t been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you fuckin` bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I`m your fucking dog!
- You`re lower than a dog!
- [ Ginger ] Fuck you!
Here!
Here!
ls this enough money?
Will it last you two fuckin` days?
Take it!
- Greedy bitch.
Take the fuckin` money.
- I`m going to the bank...
- and I`m getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a.m.
Don`t send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You`re not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
Fine!
- I`m taking Amy.
- You`re not taking Amy.
I am.
I`m waking her up right now.
You`re stoned.
You`re a junkie.
Get out of here.
- I am not!
She`s my daughter too!
- Get out of here!
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fuckin`-damn you!
You`re not getting away with this!
You`re not gonna cheat me out of my end!

[ Ace Narrating ] The funny thing was, after all that, I didn`t want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
And later, I realized I didn`t want to give her the money... because if I did, I knew I`d never see her again.
- Oh.
Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, angel.
[ Clears Throat ]
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
Here`s a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It`s very light.
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
[ Nicky ] What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can`t do that.
Listen, two people don`t get along, at some point you gotta call it.
It`s none of my business, but I think that`s what you gotta do.
You`re right.
I know.
- I was just--
- What?
What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don`t--
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewelry out?
There`s a lot of money in there.
I`d be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust, you know?
- You know he`s never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.
He holds that key so tight, he`s probably got it stuck up his ass.
[ Laughing ] You`re right.
That`s Sammy.
And he`s probably got it there too.
[ Laughs ]
He`s so fuckin` lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
- Then he`d have tracked me down, and he`d have killed me.
- No, he wouldn`t.
- I would have.
- [ Laughs ]
- He`d have been right too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
- You don`t take a guy`s kid and then take off.
- I didn`t.
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
- You did.
You`re right.
You did.
I like that.
- Exactly what you said.
- That`s what I like about you.
You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.
÷ And now that it`s all over ÷÷
He really fucked himself up out here, didn`t he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
- [ Sighs ] Changed.
- Changed.
- He did.
He ain`t the same person.
- No, he`s not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
[ Crying ] He hates my fuckin` guts.
Come on, come on.
You`re a toughie.
You can take this.
- Don`t cry.
- I`m not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I`m not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he`s gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don`t be scared.
- I need some help.
I do.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- ls that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don`t worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
- I`ll take care of you.
Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.
- It`s what you want, isn`t it?
- Thank you.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
- It`s what you want?
÷ Yes, it came from your pen, dear, but not from your heart ÷
- [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] - ÷ The third king The joke of the deck ÷
÷ You ended your letter enclosed "Please sign my check" ÷
- That`s Ace`s wife.
- ÷ Why, you fool ÷
- ÷ You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool ÷
- Fantastic.
÷ If you think that money can pay for the hard years I`ve suffered ÷
÷ `Til things broke your way ÷
- This is great for the boss.
- ÷ I`m answering your last letter that says we must part ÷
÷ I`m tearing up the pieces the way you tore up my heart ÷
÷ I smile when you kiss me and I thrill at your touch ÷
÷ My only sin was I loved you much too much ÷
÷ Win a little ÷
- [ Car Approaching ] - ÷ Lose a little ÷÷
[ Car Door Slams, Front Door Slams ]
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You didn`t answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do this thing.
I know that you want me to, but it`s just--
I`m driving down the freeway and the fuckin` thing`s beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
I`m in a restaurant, it`s embarrassing.
I don`t want to do it anymore.
Where`s Amy?
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.
I got your cigarettes.
Oscar wants you to call him.
- So who`d you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.
- Where`d you go?
- To the Riviera.
What`d you have?
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I`m gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
[ Line Rings ]
[ Hangs Up ] The line`s busy.
There`s nobody there.
[ Dialing ]
[ Line Ringing ]
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer.
It`s Sam.
All right.
I didn`t have lunch with Jennifer.
- [ Hangs Up Receiver ]
- Okay.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it`s not someone who I think it might be.
[ Sighs ] I just hope it`s not that.
[ Ace Narrating ] I knew she fucked around.
She did what she did, and I did what I had to do... but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won`t stop?
[ Ace Narrating ] It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
[ Ace Narrating ] She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
[ Panting ]
Hey, Ginger.
Don`t forget, if you`re challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don`t want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He`s not dumb, you know?
You hear what I`m saying, right?
I know.
You don`t have to tell me that.
What?
Do you think I`m stupid?
Do I think you`re stupid?
No.
I think you`re beautiful.
But I gotta go.
[ Ace Narrating ] By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn`t know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
[ Gaggi ] Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It`s private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy... he wouldn`t be fucking the Jew`s wife, would he?
Because if he is, it`s a problem.
[ Frankie Narrating ] What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up gettin` killed.
Because there`s one thing about these old-timers.
They don`t like any fucking around with the other guys` wives.
It`s bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up gettin` killed too.
- No, I ain`t seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I`m positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That`s why I`m asking.
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to know if he`s doing all right, if he`s okay.
- He`s good.
He`s fine.
- I`m asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
I wouldn`t want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you`re a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
[ Ace Narrating ] By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn`t the same Nicky anymore.
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.
[ Ace Continues ] One night he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would have decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix--
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
[ Ace Narrating ] He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
- [ Police ] Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!
[ Ace Continues ] The cops shot Blue...
- because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
- [ Gunshots ]
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He`s got a fuckin` hero sandwich here.
- What do you want?
It`s pitch black.
- Pitch black!
- It`s tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin` moron!
- I`ll be fillin` out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?
- I`m sorry!
- You jerk-off!
[ Ace Narrating ] To get even, Nicky`s crew got stoned one night... and they started shooting up the cops` houses.
It got to the point where they couldn`t talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...
- Shit, he`s covering up again.
- because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out from a teller who owed him money.
He asked me again about you and the Jew`s wife.
Walk, walk, walk.
What`d you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew`s wife.
Yeah?
What`d you tell him?
I told him I didn`t know nothin`.
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you`re fucked up.
You think he`s going home making a beef behind my back?
Nah, you would have heard something.
- What`s to stop him?
- I know, I know.
I don`t trust him anymore, but they`d never okay anything.
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.
Sure they`re asking.
They earn with the prick.
I got a funny feeling he`s gonna start a fuckin` war or something.
I`m not sure yet, but you know what I want you to do?
Who`s this guy?
Who`s this guy?
That ain`t nobody.
You know what I want you to do?
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let them show you where it`s at.
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I`m not sure yet.
- They`ll do it.
- When I`m ready, I`ll say the word.
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.
Just let me know.
But you got to be ready.
You know what I`m talkin` about?
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I`m not sure.
I`ll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they`re in the motel?
There or in the fuckin` bank.
I don`t know.
All over the joint.

She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I gotta find her.
I don`t know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger`s here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She`s there with you?
She`s there with you?
- Yeah, she`s here.

- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn`t know who to turn to.
She didn`t know where to turn.
She`s trying to save your marriage.
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin` bitch.
- Hey.
Be fuckin` nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don`t fuck up in here.

Are you out of your mind?
That`s our child.

It was just for a little while, Sam.

I ought to fuckin` have you committed.

Pure and fuckin` simple.

- I`ll fuckin` kill you.

I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.

Supposin` he goes back home and makes a fuckin` beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me what you said.
- Me?
I said nothing.
I said, "No, no, no." Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fuckin` dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."
If it`s so fucking dangerous, then why don`t you kill him?
I`m not gonna kill him.

I`m in a bad fuckin` spot here.
You know that?
A bad fuckin` spot.

[ Ace Narrating ] I`d already left the kid with neighbors... and I had about a million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.

- Will you stop it?
- You`re drunk.
You`re on drugs.

- You`re going to be sorry if you don`t stop it.
- Don`t you threaten me!

- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein-
- Shh.
- [ Ginger ] He won`t let me inside!
- [ Shutter Clicking Quickly ]
Mr. Rothstein, I`m sorry.
We`ve been getting some complaints about the noise.
- I`m trying to get in my house.
He won`t let me in.
- I understand.
I won`t let her in.
I`m sorry, Randy, I`m not gonna let her in.
- I`m not gonna let her in the way she`s behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?
- Who knows what you`re gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?
I`ve been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get a few of my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
How about if we just let her in the house to get a few things?
- This is half her house anyway.
- I`m afraid to let her in the house.
- [ Ginger ] You aren`t afraid, you fucker!
- I`m afraid she`ll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
[ Kicking Plants ]
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fucker!
Fucker!
- [ Officers ] Hold on!
Hey!
Please!
[ Ginger ] You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin` treat me!
- [ Officers ] It`ll make it easier--
- If we let her get her things...
- we`ll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house- [ Ginger ] I am calm!
- If she calms down...
I will let her in the house for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens to not want to leave.
- Can I go in?
Can I go in?
- That`s not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
[ Shutter Clicking Quickly ]
You wouldn`t believe how mean he`s been to me.
He`s locked up most of my important stuff.
All my papers and things-- I have to get them.
So don`t let him come up here.
I know they`re in here in the desk-
- Fuck.
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.
Are you watching for him?
Got `em.
I don`t want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it`ll just be a couple-- We got other things to do too.
I`ll hurry her up.
- How`s everything else besides this?
- Fine.
Fine.
- How`s your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife`s pregnant again.
- Oh, good.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
We`re kind of happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing and then we can go.
[ Softly ] Shit!
Fuck!
Shit!
God!
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don`t worry about it.
[ Footsteps Approaching ] And it would be great... if you guys could just follow me out of here... because he`s been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
[ Crying ] I can`t believe this.
I just need to pick up a little cash inside.
Could you come with me?
[ Shutter Clicking Quickly ]
- Charlie, you`ve got to stop her.
You`ve got to stop her.
- I`m sorry, Sam.
- What can I do?
- She`s a fuckin` junkie.
She`s out of her fucking mind!
She has the keys.
It`s still in both your names.
- Oh!
- There`s nothing I can do.
I`d like to help...
- but I can`t.
- Legally, she can`t take that stuff.
Legally, she can`t take that stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
- There`s nothing I can do.
- Half-
- I`m coming down.
[ Softly ] Shit!
Goddamn it!
Um, I`m gonna need a bag.
If you could just ask the guy for the big bag.
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.
- Lady, I can`t take it.
- No, you can, you can.
You`ve been so nice to me.
- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can-- - [ Shutter Clicks ]
- [ Car Approaching, Metal Scraping ] - [ Gasps ]
Oh, God, it`s him.
You have to stop him.
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.
Mr. Roth-
- Mr. Roth-- Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
- Hold on a second.
Hey.
- [ Engine Starts ]
- [ Ace ] She`s driving away.
- [ Officers ] There`s nothing we can do.
- There`s nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.
You can`t stop her for speeding?
Look what she`s doing.
- There`s nothing we can do.
She had the keys.
- She`s on the account.
- Let`s pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay.
Let`s do it.
[ Siren Wailing ]
- We`re placing you under arrest for--
- For what?
- We`re placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting--
- For what?
- We`re placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting--
- But I`m just trying to leave.
[ Ace Narrating ] After all the threats and all the bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn`t tell them anything.
- But, by then, the Feds didn`t need her anyway.
- But it was mine.
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn`t do anything.
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.!
We have a warrant!
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license--
- Paradise.
We managed to really fuck it all up.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone`s at the fuckin` door now.
F.B.I. We have a federal search warrant.
[ Nicky Narrating ] I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- My name is Mark Casper.
Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?
- Can I make a fuckin` phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.
You can make a phone call, but you don`t have to talk to us like that.
[ Agent ] Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
- [ Nicky Narrating ] They got almost everybody else.
- [ Agent ] This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.
[ Men Chattering ]
Put every box on the table.
Ah, yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures. [ Chuckling ]
[ Ace Narrating ] Green?
Don`t even ask.
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn`t.
That`s why it wasn`t valid.
I was being extorted.
I`m willing to tell you whatever you want to know.
- I`ve got nothing to hide here.
- [ Nicky Narrating ] Now for the best.
I couldn`t believe this shit.
Piscano`s expense reports took the cake.
- Oh, this is good.
Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin` blueprint.
Everybody`s names, addresses, dates, everything.
Look at this.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother`s books.
- You`re under arrest.
- [ Nicky Narrating ] What a fuckin` balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?
- Take it easy.
- [ Groans ] Wait!
- Wait a minute!
He`s sick!
Oh, God!
- Move back.
- I think it`s his heart!
Oh, God!
ls he breathing?
- C.P.R. now!
[ Ace Narrating ] Poor Artie.
He got so upset, he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- Artie!
No, I won`t calm down!
- He`s my husband!
Artie!
Artie!
- We can`t help him if--
[ Ace Narrating ] And at the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that?
[ Ace Narrating ] But I didn`t want to look at them.
I didn`t want to look at the guys who brought them either.
÷÷ [ "House of the Rising Sun" ]
Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
[ Nicky Narrating ] When the bosses were arrested, some of them were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
[ Lawyer ] Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set.
- We`re going to take a recess.
- [ Nicky Narrating ] When it looked like they could get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimmin` a casino... sick or no fuckin` sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the courthouse.
See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It`s always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won`t talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That`s the way I see it.
I agree.
He`s solid.
He`s a fuckin` Marine.
He`s okay.
He always was.
Remo, what do you think?
Look... why take a chance?
At least, that`s the way I feel about it.
Call Artie.
Tell him, I don`t care what...
- he`s got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It`s done.
It`s terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with that guy--
[ Firing Gun ]
[ Nicky Narrating ] As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn`t one of us.
He wasn`t Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
- He thought nobody would find him there.
- [ Gunshots ]
[ Breaks Glass ]
[ Gunshots, Furniture Crashing ]
[ Nicky Narrating ] But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So, naturally, the bosses were afraid he`d come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you goin`, jag-off?
[ Nicky Narrating ] But, anyway, they all had to follow.
- Everybody went down.
- [ Groans ]
Fuck you.
[ Nicky Narrating ] Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up gettin` whacked.
- [ Fires Gun ] - [ Groaning ]
[ Woman ] Oh, no!
No!
No!
÷÷ [ "House Of The Rising Sun" Continues ]
[ Ace Narrating ] After Ginger took off, she wasn`t much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels.
[ Groaning ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Ace Narrating ] After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was 3,600 in mint condition coins.
No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn`t know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver`s seat.
It`s the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
- [ Man ] Hey, Nicky.
- [ Ace Narrating ] And so did the powers that be.
- How are you?
- How you doin`?
[ Nicky Narrating ] It took months for everything to calm down.
But, finally, my guys got out on bail... and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin` dollars.
I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn`t want my brother to get fucked around.
I mean, what`s right is right.
- They don`t give a fuck about-- - [ Groans ]
Holy fuckin`!
What the fuck--
Come on, motherfucker!
- [ Yelling ]
- Tough guys!
You and your fuckin` brother!
- [ Nicky Gagging ]
- You fuckin` scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
[ Men Shouting ]
- Frankie!
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
[ Nicky ] Fuckin` punk, motherfucker!
Piece of shit!
[ Men Shouting ]
No, no, no, no!
Take this motherfucker out!
- [ Men Continue Clubbing ] - [ Dominick Moaning ]
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He`s still breathing.
He`s still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
[ Frankie Continues Clubbing ] All right.
Strip him.
[ Nicky Crying ] No balls.
You got no fuckin` balls.
Ah, Dominick.
Ah, Dom.
[ Crying ]
[ Nicky ] Dominick.
Dominick.
[ Sobbing ] Dominick.
Oh, Dominick.
[ Frankie ] Come on, come on.
- Bury them?
- Bury them.
- [ Gasping ] - [ Ace Narrating ] The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
- [ Gasping ]
- They buried them while they were still breathing.
Mister, you all right?
Watch out!
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.
[ Ace Narrating ] They had other ideas for me.
[ Sirens Blaring, Firemen Chattering ]
[ Chatter Continues ]
[ Fireman ] We need some help over here!
- [ Groans ]
- You sure are lucky, mister.
÷÷ [ Choir Singing ]
÷÷ [ Choir Continues ]
[ Ace Narrating ] The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
÷÷ [ Choir Continues ]
[ Ace Narrating ] And while the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior`s college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it`s like checkin` into an airport.
And if you order room service, you`re lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it`s all gone.
You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the Pyramids?
Junk bonds.
Still not sure?
- [ Bell Ringing ]
- Probable.
Maybe questionable.
Let me know as soon as you can find out.
[ Ace Narrating ] But in the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that`s that.

ADAPTED FROM A TRUE STORY
SAM: [Voiceover] When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.
There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.
Otherwise, what's the point?
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.
[Dramatic operatic music]
[Operatic music becomes calmer]
SAM:
Before I ever ran a casino, or got blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.
I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I'd change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I'm serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on Earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money.
$62, 700, 000.
I don't know all the details.
nicky: [Voiceover] In fact, nobody knew all the details... but it should've been perfect.
He had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should've been so sweet, too.
It turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fucking valuable again.
SAM:
Vegas was a place where suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
nicky:
Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
You gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you're talking about 30 or 45 minutes of digging.
Who knows who's gonna be coming along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fucking night.
[Horns honking]
THE strip
- LAS VEGAS TEN YEARS earlier
[Upbeat jazz music]
SAM:
Who could resist?
Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler... always looking over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and went to work.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
SAM:
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It's like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
[Upbeat jazz music intensifies]
SAM:
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
What do you think we're doing here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comped trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.
That's the truth about Las Vegas.
We're the only winners.
The players don't stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the Holy of holies, the count room.
Now, this place was off-limits.
Even I couldn't get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.
nicky:
They had so much money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills.
And the best part was that upstairs... the Board of Directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
To them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify $5,000.
nicky:
The guys in the counting room... were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
They'd even take cash right out of the drop-boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standing in front of $2 million... to skim the cash off the top without anybody getting wise... the IRS or anybody.
Notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always looking the other way.
Look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They're counting money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra $100 a week... just to watch the door.
It's routine.
Business as usual... in, out, hello, goodbye.
That's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walking out of a casino with a suitcase.
Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place:
right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without getting themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.
And they wanted it every month.
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
-Something smells good.
-They made us something to eat.
nicky:
The bosses would come from all over:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest... and they would meet in this produce market in Kansas City.
Nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do the cooking.
Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
nicky:
These old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.
WOMAN:
Mama, that man's here again.
nicky:
Because they controlled the Teamsters Union.
And that's where you had to go to borrow money to buy a casino.
WOMAN 2:
Would you put in shrimp?
WOMAN:
I would.
nicky:
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
nicky:
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
FRANK:
About 20 pounds.
Around $700,000.
REMO:
Good.
STONE:
It's a little early for Las Vegas... but I want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry....
SAM:
As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund... was a legitimate guy.
A powerful man.
He played golf with the President.
ANDY:
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
I'm glad to present...
SAM:
But he also took orders.
When he was told to give a pension-fund loan to Philip Green this cheque for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
...he did what he was told.
nicky:
Here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.
He didn't want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him money.
He wanted to believe they gave him the money because he was smart.
I say that knowing just how much competition we have in this city.
[Upbeat jazz music]
nicky:
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that he was an Arizona real-estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his fucking cheque.
And it was the bosses' man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the Chairman of the Board, Philip Green.
I understand.
[Upbeat jazz music intensifies]
nicky:
Now all they needed was... someone they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
He was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fucking place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot to run a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don't know if I could do this.
The Gaming Commission would never give me a licence.
I have at least 24 gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a licence to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The State law says that you can work in a casino... while they process your application.
ANDY:
They got a 10-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
ANDY:
Why would they want to find out?
We're putting $100 million here.
Why would they lock us out?
ANDY:
They'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
Then they put your application at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys who've worked there for 30 years don't have a licence.
It's a tough proposition, Andy.
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
ANDY:
You got it.
I'm serious.
No interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
[Upbeat jazz music]
nicky:
And that's how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title, too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15, and he always made money.
He didn't bet like you or me.
Having some fun with it, shit like that.
Where did you learn how to deal?
nicky:
He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.
SAM:
Place the checks properly.
-That's the way you do it.
-Yes, sir.
nicky:
He had to know everything.
He'd find out the inside stuff nobody else knew... and that's what he'd put his money on.
BACK HOME YEARS AGO Even back home, years ago... when we first hung out, he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...
I'll take Columbia for $20,000.
...if his girlfriend was knocked up.
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the bounce you got off different kinds of wood... on college basketball courts.
He'd be working on this day and night.
He knew everything about a game he would bet on.
Ace got down at $6,000.
Get me down at $6,000.
nicky:
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that's just the way he was.
Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fucking degenerate gambler who always lost.
All those fucking sweeps.
nicky:
Unless Ace made his bets.
Enough now!
nicky:
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
Fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fucking zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fucking Remo everything.
And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
Keeping Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma....
How'd you do it?
That's why they paid so well.
REMO:
You see?
Never tells me nothing.
What do we got on for next week?
It's a little too early.
I'll know by Thursday.
Is that all right?
REMO:
You'll come by the house?
SAM:
I'll come by.
At 7:00.
REMO:
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up.
REMO:
Hey, Nick.
I'll be right out.
See that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He's making a lot of money for us.
And he'll continue making money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like the fucking Feds out there, without brains.
REMO:
Okay?
nicky:
All right.
Want me to take this?
nicky:
Now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks with the Golden Jew.
Couple of shooters for the ladies.
SAM:
Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
They all made money with us.
How did Nicky collect?
Don't ask.
Then where the fuck is the money?
I don't see it.
-Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
-Hi, Sam.
Who's this guy?
MAN:
Get the fuck out.
I laid nine.
nicky:
It was eight.
nicky:
Ace, tell him the line on the Bears game.
-Eight.
-lf he don't know, nobody knows.
nicky:
It was eight.
MAN:
How come I laid nine?
'Cause you're a jag-off.
-Excuse me.
-What?
-ls this your pen?
-Yeah, that's my pen.
Why?
It's nice.
I didn't know whose it was.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Thank you.
Why don't you take that fucking pen... and shove it up your ass, you fucking jag-off?
-Well, I was just offering--
-Asshole.
MAN:
Look out, Joe.
[Woman shrieking]
[Nicky grunting]
[Man groaning in pain]
[Pop music continues]
What's that?
You hear a little girl?
Is that a little fucking girl?
What happened to the tough guy... who told my friend to stick it up his fucking ass?
Nicky, take it easy.
[Man whimpering]
SAM:
While I tried to figure out why the guy said what he said...
Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
If you beat him with a gun, you'd better kill him... because he'll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
[Pop music continues faintly]
nicky:
With me protecting Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
That's what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fucking drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.
[Rhythmic blues music]
SAM:
In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the good old boys.
Without us, these guys would still be shovelling mule shit.
You've got to keep a cleaner station.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him.
Won't happen again, Sam.
SAM:
Mr. Rothstein.
MAN:
It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
-You need this guy.
-Can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
SAM:
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
DEALER:
Thanks, Senator.
SAM:
They passed the laws, owned the courts.
I need a room.
SAM:
I had dozens of politicians and state officials coming through weekly.
SAM:
Get him what he wants.
billy:
Certainly.
SAM:
Why not make them happy?
[Upbeat RB music]
For politicians, like our State Senator up there... everything was on the house.
These guys won their comped life when they got elected.
Why not take advantage of it?
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30, 000 a hand in baccarat.
That's the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big.
He has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
A year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and $2 million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
ICHlKAWA:
What went wrong?
billy:
I'm awfully sorry.
These mechanical things happen.
Better here than up there.
SAM:
Then he missed the flights connecting with Japan.
I can't believe there's no room.
SAM:
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
-Sorry you missed your plane.
-You'd like some of my money back.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
[Upbeat RB music]
SAM:
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet $1,000 a hand, instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.
But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa... was that they can't bet small for long.
He didn't think of it as winning $10, 000... he thought of it as losing $90, 000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up $1 million of his own cash.
In a casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all.
[Upbeat RB music]
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.
Since the players are looking to beat the casino... the dealers are watching the players... the boxmen are watching the dealers... the floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I'm watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
[Upbeat RB music continues]
Yes!
-Very nice.
-I told you I was hot tonight.
Looking good.
MAN:
Let's go.
This is for Ginger.
MAN:
Let me have $100 on your hard 10.
Thank you.
MAN:
Here we go now.
[Upbeat RB music]
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-The dice.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This $100 is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
-Come on.
-What's the matter?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I've seen you stealing.
"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.
ginger:
I want my half.
GAMBLER:
I've watched you.
-I want my money.
-Your bag is full of chips.
ginger:
I didn't steal anything from you.
GAMBLER:
Get lost!
ginger:
Get lost?
GAMBLER:
Yes!
-Well, how about that?
-Come on!
[Upbeat RB music continues]
[Romantic pop music]
SAM:
What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
[Romantic rock music]
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
SAM:
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
DOORMAN:
See you.
ginger:
Thanks for asking.
SAM:
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers and helped them spend a lot of money.
-Hello.
-Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
ginger:
Great.
You might have something for me.
Got me covered?
ginger:
Thank you.
VALET:
Take care of yourself.
I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
SAM:
Who didn't want her?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
[Romantic rock music continues]
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
SAM:
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
ginger:
How you doing tonight?
cashier:
Good.
cashier:
How are you?
ginger:
Beat.
SAM:
Ginger had the hustlers' code.
ginger:
Take one for you.
cashier:
Thank you.
SAM:
She knew how to take care of people.
That's what Vegas is all about.
cashier: $6,800.
ginger:
Thanks.
SAM:
It's kickback city.
ginger:
Have a good night.
SAM:
She took care of the dealers... pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... who took care of the security guards, who took care of the cops... who let her operate.
I need that stuff tonight.
VALET:
No problem.
ginger:
You are a doll.
SAM:
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.
But one thing I didn't understand... was that she had everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
I got other people in this.
I got partners.
I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?
You'll get yours back, and you'll get it back first.
Okay?
-All right.
-Where you going?
Where are you?
You're in that place.
-I'm here.
-No, you're not.
Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
-You are.
-I am.
SAM:
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
-Good luck.
-Yeah.
SAM:
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...
-chasing dentists for a few bucks.
-Careful.
SAM:
He was always broke.
He always had a story.
Somehow, she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it was that he was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
BACK HOME
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
SAM:
He took care of himself only too well.
That's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
I folded these things beautifully.
I would appreciate a little respect.
Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
SAM:
Even after a vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Frank Marino was there to meet him.
So were the cops.
They wanted to pinch him...
-for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.
-Help me fold these.
SAM:
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where.
They were usually right.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
ginger:
There we go.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
SAM:
I mean that's what worried me... 'cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
jennifer:
All right, we're clear.
nicky:
There's more.
nicky:
There's a couple stuck in there.
-I'm telling you, they're out!
-Come on.
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What's that?
There's no more.
Thanks.
nicky:
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn't send me out to have a good time.
They sent me out to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fucking skim.
-Hey.
-Hey, how you doing?
Hey, Sammy.
-Boy, look at this place.
-Incredible.
SAM:
Welcome to Vegas.
nicky:
Okay, Sammy.
SAM:
Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What've you been doing out here?
SAM:
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick.
They're dear friends of mine.
-Hi, Jennifer.
-A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
SAM:
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
You mean I have your permission?
Sure, you do.
But I just gotta tell you... it's no joke out here.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It's not like back home.
They don't like guys like us.
This sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even coppers aren't afraid to bury people in the desert.
I don't care.
I want to get away from back home for a while.
I'm tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
nicky:
Ace saw Vegas one way...
nicky:
Call and tell him I'm coming?
JACK:
Of course.
...but I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
They had bookies, pimps, and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started getting everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
SAM:
He had a foolproof scheme.
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected.
When he lost, he told the bookies to fuck off.
What were they gonna do?
Muscle Nicky?
Nicky was the muscle.
-Hey, how you doing?
-How you doing?
-You got that thing for me?
-What thing?
Nicky, I thought you was laying.
I was laying?
No, I'm taking it.
-You sure?
-I'm positive.
-I'm a little confused.
-You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fucking face through this window... you'll get unconfused.
-Give me the fucking money.
-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it.
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was laying it.
-My fucking head.
-Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first President.
George Washington was born--
SAM:
But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
We presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town...
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
COACH:
You got a beautiful swing.
nicky:
Ace got Little Nicky involved with Little League.
It was great.
Turned out that one of the other coaches was a metro intelligence cop.
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.
He's gotta realise everything can't be a home run.
That's exactly what I tell him, but that's the kind of kid he is.
[People applauding]
SAM:
And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
nicky:
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.
I was to make sure no other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fucking balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of $200, 000.
Yeah, right, I'm sure.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm over here now.
-You're over here?
-Yeah, I'm over here with them.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase, and then he left.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's out?
I think he went across the street or somewhere else or something.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
-Thanks, Eddy.
-Lots of luck.
Good luck to you, too.
cashier:
They forgot to sign their papers.
They don't need those anymore.
SAM:
Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
They're the morons who give you the most trouble.
We'd catch them and they'd try to sneak back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy.
He's betting lavender chips... at $500 each with only one little problem.
He's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fucking greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they're all greedy.
[Upbeat rock music]
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.
He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card... and signalling his buddy at this table.
[Metallic clicking]
And that's just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over to Pit 2 right away.
[Upbeat rock music continues]
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
WAlTRESSES: [Singing] Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Jeff
Happy birthday to you
[Electric zap]
GUARD:
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
SAM:
They never know what hit them.
If and when they do find out they got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fucking pals were knocking this place dead for years.
GUARD 1 :
He's wired.
HUSTLER:
What are you doing?
GUARD 1 :
There it is.
That's it.
GUARD 2:
Cheater's justice.
HUSTLER:
Oh, God!
[Saw whirring]
No!
SAM:
I wanted everybody to know that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand.
-Can you do that with both hands?
-No.
SAM:
You can't do it with both hands?
HUSTLER:
No, sir.
-Can you do it with your left hand?
-I never tried.
-So, you're a righty.
-Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
-It's $100,000, $1 10,000 I think.
-Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hi.
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
By the way, send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
cashier:
Sure will.
billy:
Real special.
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
billy:
Having a good time?
HUSTLER 2:
Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
HUSTLER 2:
I have a plane to catch.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
SAM:
I'm gonna give you a choice:
You can have the money and the hammer, or you can walk out of here.
-What do you want?
-I wanna get out of here.
Tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
-I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
-You're fucking right.
SAM:
If you come back, either one of you, we'll break your fucking heads.
You see that fucking saw?
We're gonna use it.
We don't fuck around here.
SAM:
Got it?
HUSTLER 2:
Yes.
-Get out of here.
-Thank you.
Throw him out in the alley.
Tell the cops he got hit by a car.
SAM:
Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters, the pro was way up... the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We're not getting any younger.
Don't you think it's time?
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?
Banging around, hustling around?
-Are you trying to handicap me?
-I'm gonna do you one better.
I'm trying to marry you.
SAM:
You wanna marry me?
SAM:
I'm serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.
What do you know?
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.
I can't think of anybody better to be with.
I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people?
'Cause I don't.
I know all that.
[Sighs]
I care about you.
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.
SAM:
All right.
ginger:
Understand?
ginger:
I'm sorry.
No....
That can grow.
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.
SAM:
What is love anyway?
SAM:
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.
It's a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out... if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.
So whatever happens... if it doesn't work out between us...
I'll make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.
If there are kids, especially...
I'll take care of you better than you'd imagine.
ginger:
What are you pitching me?
SAM:
Just what I said.
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.
That I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
[Applause and clinking glasses]
[Romantic instrumental music]
SAM:
When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories... but I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
nicky:
It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town.
He knew they'd show.
He knew they all wanted something from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.
Even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby first, before they could get married.
He even made us watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
I didn't mind, we loved the kid.
LESTER:
Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don't make me come there.
Answer me.
ginger: [Crying] I love you.
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?
ginger:
No, Lester.
LESTER:
Do you know that?
ginger:
Yes.
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
ginger:
You do?
LESTER:
Yeah, I do.
It's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.
I'm looking at you right now.
I'm seeing you for the very first time, right this minute.
I'm saying I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
LESTER:
Every time I see you, that's what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
-Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
-I'm okay.
[Ginger sniffles]
You just have to understand.
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I just....
I think I have a right to do that.
ginger:
Okay?
It's all right.
That part of your life is over with.
SAM:
Right?
ginger:
Yeah.
You're with me now.
-Yeah.
-Right?
SAM:
You're sure?
ginger:
Yeah.
SAM:
Want to go?
Let's go back in.
ginger:
Okay.
[Soothing instrumental music]
ginger:
It's great.
[Soothing music continues]
[Ginger exclaims in delight]
ginger:
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can't....
Try it on.
It's yours.
You're kidding.
My God.
-What is it?
-It's chinchilla.
It's so soft.
Nice, isn't it?
No one's ever been so nice to me.
[Exclaiming]
ginger:
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's too much if I wear these all on the same day?
You can do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
You're so wonderful.
The jewellery's not so bad either.
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
SAM:
With over $1 million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas... only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take cheques.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
SAM:
So I put $2 million cash in a Los Angeles bank... under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
[Upbeat pop music]
This is just a signature card.
Once she signs, she'll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
BANKER:
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Sure I do.
Why?
It's good.
It's just unusual.
To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
[Singing romantic ballad]
SAM:
With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
To play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a licence.
Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was Nicky was dreaming of his own kind of Vegas.
nicky:
I put money out on the street charging three points a week.
Juice to the dealers.
-Don't make us look for you.
-You won't have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
nicky:
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, the next thing I did, I started busting out high-stakes poker players.
SAM:
It was so obvious.
All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were signal-happy.
I'm gonna open for $500.
SAM:
Signalling back and forth.
[Gamblers chattering]
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
-Four aces.
-I can't believe this.
GAMBLER 2:
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.
SAM:
I wished Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.
I can't do that.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.
nicky:
Ace was so worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doing out here in the first place.
A million times, I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:
"This is Las Vegas.
"We're supposed to be out here robbing, you dumb fucking hebe. "
[Lively pop music playing]
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.
Tell him to take his feet off the table.
Does he think this is a goddamn sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table... and put your shoes on, please?
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.
Fucking asshole won't budge.
Call security.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Do me a favour.
Want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes on?
Fuck you.
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, off his feet... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
You mind coming with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain't going anywhere with you.
GUARD:
Bullshit.
You're out of here.
MAN:
Fuck you!
MAN:
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?
MAN:
Leave me alone!
GUARD:
Come on!
MAN:
You gotta be kidding me!
SAM:
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
I didn't know that.
You know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
SAM:
Then he called me a faggot.
nicky:
What?
SAM:
I threw that cocksucker out.
nicky:
Come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
Told him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
nicky: [On phone] You fucking hick, you!
nicky:
You go over there.
You apologise.
nicky:
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get out of line again, I'll smash your head so hard... you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fucking hick.
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.
He's already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favour and let him back in...
I swear he'll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he's out for good.
I'll never let him in the place again.
nicky:
I'm sorry about this.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.
nicky:
Go over and apologise.
MAN:
Nicky, I'm sorry.
nicky:
Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired Jonathan and David away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.
But, I tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fucking angles.
He brought the whole Femme Fatale show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh them once a week so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.
You're still eight pounds over.
-What's the reason for this?
-Mr.
Rothstein, sir--
Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them--
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I don't know why.
She's frightened if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--
-It's been our policy--
-Stop everything.
AGENT:
She's an institution.
SAM:
That's the problem.
She's lazy.
nicky:
I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So he took bookie joints off the street... and opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years, he had... every casino on The Strip trying to copy off of him.
SAM:
Between my innovations... and Nicky's dedication to his job...
I soon had the best operation on The Strip.
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you.
Why, somebody is complaining?
I'm hearing things from security.
They're all ex-cops.
The sheriff wants to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
There's two names in it for the whole country... and one of them is still Al Capone.
They put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.
You won't be able to walk into a casino.
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.
I'm just telling you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
[Upbeat swing music]
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
[People chattering]
philip:
For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
[Applause]
SAM:
Back home, they'd put me in jail for what I'm doing.
But out here, they're giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... from the Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.
SAM:
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife work the room.
They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.
LADY:
We'd love to have her there.
3:00, Saturday.
-Yes, okay.
-Great.
SAM:
She made everybody feel good.
-Congratulations, Sam.
-Thanks.
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've seen.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thanks for that compliment.
SAM:
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fucking kid.
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
ginger:
Do you wanna see this one?
[Ginger exclaims]
ginger:
Daddy gave me all this jewellery because he loves me so much.
SAM:
But as much as they loved her...
ginger:
Fabulous.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
ginger:
Look at this.
ginger:
Daddy gave me....
SAM:
With Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doing back there?
You can't even see them.
Okay.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front.
-Bring them up front.
-All right, I will.
Listen carefully.
There are three ways of doing things here.
The right way, the wrong way, and the way that I do it.
-Understand?
-I do understand.
I'll get right on it.
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.
Just do it.
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right.
I'm so sorry.
SAM:
So I ended up working 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him that I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
You might as well get something out of it.
SAM:
It wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Vegas.
From then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in or near Vegas.
nicky:
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"...detrimental to gaming and...
"he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
"And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000...
"every time he shows up."
-You believe this shit?
-Yeah, you got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavoury reputation."
Motherfucker.
[Nostalgic country music]
-ls there any way around this?
-No, there's no way.
Let's say, for instance...
I want to go into the restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can't even set foot in the parking lot.
That's how serious it is.
-ln other words, I'm fucked?
-ln so many words, yes.
SAM:
It didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.
You're listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do something.
They ain't getting rid of me.
They're not getting rid of me.
I'm staying here.
Fuck them.
nicky:
So once they pulled that shit...
I started doing my own things in Vegas nobody had thought of doing.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother and some desperados... from back home and started knocking over high rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers, anybody right here in town.
I had a good fucking crew going for me, I'll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
Then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy could bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
I opened up my own jewellery store, too.
The Gold Rush.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.
I didn't like the people I was ripping off looking at me... so I turned their fucking pictures around.
nicky:
What's taking so long?
JACK:
This is a motherfucker!
It's working.
nicky:
Learn to open these instead of taking them.
nicky:
These stones got a lot of niggers in them.
If that fucking Pepe's switching stones on us... he better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.
[Phone rings]
-They're in Penthouse "K."
-Check in alone?
-They checked in alone.
-Are they out now?
-Yes.
Don't worry.
-All right.
Thanks.
SAM:
He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen...
-You got to hurry.
-Okay.
-...valet parkers...
-They're just checking in now.
-I'll tell him.
-...pit bosses...
Room 1 230 at the Scirocco.
-1 230.
Right.
-...secretaries.
-Mint condition coins.
-Mint condition?
All right.
SAM:
They all got a piece of the score.
MAN:
Car's coming.
[Energetic rock music]
SAM:
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else, if not... they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
nicky:
What the fuck did they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?
-This diamond has flaws in it.
-There's no flaws in it.
Don't tell me.
I'm doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws in this diamond.
nicky:
When we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs, or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
Are you gonna have a meeting or buy some diamonds?
I know his language.
I'm talking with him.
$40,000, you buy the whole package.
$20,000.
That's my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.
nicky:
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.
She fell asleep on the couch watching TV every night.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.
The bosses were making so much money with the casinos... that they didn't want anybody making any waves.
You've all given your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.
nicky:
That's why there was no real organised street stuff in Vegas before I came.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you must be prepared to take some kind of loss.
nicky:
I put some money in legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.
-You will try to push it through, won't you?
-Yes.
You got to understand, I'm giving you $50,000 cash.
nicky:
Then I put more money in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
DOMlNlCK:
Is that the last one?
COOK:
Yeah.
nicky:
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it.
Fuckers.
DOMlNlCK:
Here you go, guys.
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it.
Have a good time.
-Choke on it, motherfucker.
-Hi, Dom.
How you doing?
SAM:
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with them.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over.
That show at The Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
-Made you a messenger, too?
-I'll do anything for a buck.
-He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.
SAM:
I got to tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.
To them, Nicky was the movie star.
-You walk past me?
-This is Shelly.
-Hi, Shelly.
How are you?
-Hi.
This is Stacy.
-This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
Come on.
-All right.
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
nicky:
Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
You can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.
nicky:
It'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
AL:
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
-That's what I did.
-Yeah?
You call yourself a man?
You know you're a lying lowlife, motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fucking heat's off?
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?
-No, you didn't?
-I didn't.
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?
Tell me you gambled the money and I'll give you the money to put the heat on!
Did you gamble?
Fucking degenerate, you.
Fucking kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck out of here.
AL:
Thanks, Nick.
nicky:
Yeah, thanks.
If I find out you fucked up, I'll leave you where I find you.
nicky:
How many of these you gonna eat?
nicky JR.:
Two.
SAM:
At around 6:30 a.m., when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
nicky:
I know you like this.
nicky:
A little butter, right?
Not a lot.
You know why, right?
nicky:
Why?
nicky JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
nicky:
Okay, eat.
nicky:
Every couple of weeks, I sent Marino back to the bosses...
BACK HOME with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?
They were 1, 500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
nicky:
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message...
I would carry things out to a "T.'
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo's bars.
Here's a fucking guy who kills two of Remo's guys... and a poor fucking waitress who was just working on her night off.
This guy's just begging to be made an example of.
I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
I don't care what you have to do to them to get them.
You understand?
FRANK:
I'll take care of it.
nicky:
To be truthful with you, I had to admire this fucking guy.
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.
This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two nights, we beat the shit out of him.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
nicky:
Hope he gives me a name, or I'll give him yours, Frank.
FRANK:
Thanks a lot.
nicky:
But he never talked.
nicky:
I know you would've ratted by now.
nicky:
In the end, I had to put his fucking head in a vice.
nicky:
Can you hear me?
Listen to me.
I got your head in a vice.
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.
nicky:
Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Fuck you.
Motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?
You motherfucker!
Oh, God.
Give me the fucking name!
Charlie M.
-Charlie M.
-Charlie M?
You make me pop your eye out your head... to protect that piece of shit?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
You motherfucker!
Frankie, do him a fucking favour.
SAM:
Word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
nicky:
Charlie M.
[Coins clinking]
SAM:
Four reels, sevens across.
Three $15,000 jackpots.
You have any idea what the odds are?
It's gotta be in the millions.
Maybe more.
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?
Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?
It happened quick.
Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.
You didn't see the scam?
There's no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
An infallible way.
They won!
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
You're pissing me off.
You're insulting my intelligence.
You think I'm an idiot?
Somebody had to get into those machines and set the reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.
It can't happen.
SAM:
What's the matter with you?
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
-You didn't see that?
-I think you're overreacting.
Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.
I've carried your ass ever since I got here.
Get your things and get out of here.
-You're firing me?
-I'm firing you.
-You might regret this.
-I'll regret it if I keep you.
-This is not the way to treat people.
-lf you didn't know about the scam... you're too dumb to work here.
If you did, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.
Go on.
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.
You can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everyone out here with cowboy boots is a commissioner or related to one.
I'm sick of this.
This is his state.
His uncle's Chief Judge.
His brother-in-law runs the County Commission.
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
You're in the finances, upstairs.
You don't see what's going on.
I've got thousands of players.
I got 500 dealers.
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.
That there is not one single thing I will not catch.
SAM:
Look at yours.
Look at that.
SAM:
Look at this.
There's nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
-I have nothing.
-What are you talking about?
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
philip:
Where are you going?
SAM:
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that will take?
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
SAM:
Wanna go to Mummy?
ginger:
Wanna come to Mummy?
It's all right, sweetheart.
ginger:
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
-What do you need?
-Got her?
I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don't you take it out of your account?
I would, it's just that...
I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
$25,000?
-For yourself?
-Yeah.
SAM:
Why do you need that much?
What's the difference?
I just need it.
I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.
It's not a box of popcorn.
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.
We don't have to have a fight.
ginger:
It was important to me.
Forget it.
Something I wanted to do.
Who's fighting?
Tell me what it's for.
Why can't you tell me what it's for?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for $25,000.
Do you want a coat?
ginger:
No.
SAM:
If you want a coat, you got it.
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
I've been independent all my life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
Now you're making me beg you for this.
-What are you talking about?
-Okay?
And you're embarrassing me.
Why make me feel so bad?
SAM:
You're asking me for $25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
It's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you can tell me what the money is for.
[Sentimental jazz music]
She's leaving the bank now.
I'll follow her.
LESTER:
What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
ginger:
It means I got the money.
How are you doing?
It's Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
SAM:
If I'm wrong, correct me.
I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine, too.
Take it.
You already have hers.
She's my wife.
SAM:
Look at me.
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew she's my wife?
SAM:
Look at me.
LESTER:
I know that.
SAM:
You do, yeah?
If you ever come back again... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.
Now, you want to do me a favour?
Get out of here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get the fuck up and get out of here.
SAM:
Fucking piece of shit.
Remember when you called him that night and said goodbye to him?
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."
-He didn't say that, did he?
-No, he didn't.
What did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."
Come here.
I want to show you something.
[Men shouting]
[Car horn honking]
ginger:
Make them stop it!
[Ginger screaming hysterically]
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!
[Ginger continues screaming]
THUG:
Piece of shit.
LESTER:
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He's such a prick.
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn't want to do it himself.
He didn't want to get his own hands dirty.
Why did he have to do that?
Tell me.
nicky:
It wasn't a nice thing to do-- ginger:
No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down.
I told him all about this guy before we got married.
-This is no fucking surprise.
-You did?
I didn't know that.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
The first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
nicky:
I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you.
He really loves you.
nicky:
He does.
ginger:
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open.
ginger:
I knew the bottom could drop out any time.
I'm a working girl.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this... if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?
Sure, I can see that.
So he put aside some jewellery for me.
A lot of jewellery.
A lot of expensive jewellery?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I'm just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I'm told it's worth about $1 million, maybe more.
nicky:
There you go.
What does that tell you?
$1 million in jewellery.
Does that tell you he is crazy about you?
I should have never married him.
He's a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.
I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
This is probably not....
I don't have the answers anyway.
-This is probably not what you want to hear.
-I do.
You're a little upset, and I understand that.
But try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could've killed him!
He didn't have to hit him.
I'm not sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What the fuck is that all about?
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worries.
Who gives a fuck what I do?
I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.
-When I see him, I'll talk to him.
-Okay.
-All right?
-Yeah.
Thanks... for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl.
Don't ruin that.
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You're so nice.
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.
Thanks.
It's all right.
[Phone ringing]
County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
-Give me a minute.
-Okay.
Just a minute.
receptionist:
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you, little lady.
Send him in and call me four minutes after.
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
How do you do?
-lt is a pleasure.
-I heard a lot about you.
PAT:
Thank you, sir.
House is doing well.
All that money is rolling in.
I appreciate you taking the time to see a poor old civil servant.
SAM:
Why don't you have a seat?
PAT:
Thank you, sir.
PAT:
I come here personally to smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
Maybe you didn't know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends.
His family and their money go back many years.
Friends vote, family and money votes.
That's important to me and you.
If you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you'll forgive me for saying it... maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
He knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
Either he was in on it or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he'd be under arrest.
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky?
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.
What you're saying is libellous.
You're in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be helpful and courteous to that kid.
He's weak.
He's incompetent.
He jeopardises the whole place.
There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
[Pat coughs]
But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favour... if you'd think some more on hiring him back.
I can't do that.
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law.
I do want to help you and I like to do favours.
And I know who you are.
But I cannot do that.
Could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.
He's too incompetent.
The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.
[Phone ringing]
SAM:
Okay, thanks a lot.
That's it.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests.
But you act like you're at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.
But that's where we'll send you if it harelips the Governor.
-Thank you for your time.
-No problem.
-Sorry.
-You bet.
SAM:
What happened to my pills?
Isn't it bad enough you drink too much?
You're taking my pills, too?
ginger:
I didn't take your pills.
For my ulcer, I take a half of one of these.
That's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with them?
ginger: [Crying] You didn't have to beat him up.
SAM:
What?
ginger:
I was just trying to help him.
ginger:
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
ginger:
You can't make me stop caring about people.
SAM:
What?
ginger:
I said... you can't make me stop caring about people.
SAM:
Listen...
I'm trying to make the best of everything here.
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.
People look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit.
I'm getting out of here.
SAM:
You gotta get a hold of yourself.
ginger:
Okay.
SAM:
If not for me, at least for Amy.
SAM:
Understand?
Your drinking's getting way out of hand.
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
-I don't need one.
-Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.
That's all you care about.
ginger:
You don't care about me.
SAM:
Yes, I do.
ginger:
No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that stuff, that fucking leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Oh, God.
[Ginger sobbing]
I'll try.
ginger:
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
nicky:
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rolling in... and the suitcases kept coming and going.
And let me tell you, the fucking bottom line here is cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this fucking trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
nicky:
Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the scam... he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Right?
You go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the whole purpose of what we're doing.
They take this money because they're my guys, so give them some leeway.
nicky:
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
BOSS:
What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.
BOSS:
What were you doing with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.
nicky:
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
BOSS:
What you been doing?
ARTlE:
I'm out there more than I'm here.
nicky:
Little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they would've been better off making fucking novenas.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?
I'm laying money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping records.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.
What the hell are we doing over here?
You're going to Las Vegas and having a good time at my expense.
What the fuck?
I mean, after all....
SAM:
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
philip:
I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA:
We made a deal.
SAM:
It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity"... had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and demanded money from Tangiers...
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.
ANNA:
I'm not.
philip:
You are.
No, I am not wrong.
...Green tried to stonewall her.
ANNA:
I will see that you don't get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its President, Philip Green.
OBERON:
Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN:
Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
JUDGE:
Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON:
Thank you.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books...
ginger:
You don't care about me.
SAM:
Yes, I do.
ginger:
No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that stuff, that fucking leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Oh, God.
[Ginger sobbing]
I'll try.
ginger:
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
nicky:
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rolling in... and the suitcases kept coming and going.
And let me tell you, the fucking bottom line here is cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this fucking trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
nicky:
Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the scam... he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Right?
You go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the whole purpose of what we're doing.
They take this money because they're my guys, so give them some leeway.
nicky:
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
BOSS:
What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.
BOSS:
What were you doing with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.
nicky:
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
BOSS:
What you been doing?
ARTlE:
I'm out there more than I'm here.
nicky:
Little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they would've been better off making fucking novenas.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?
I'm laying money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping records.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.
What the hell are we doing over here?
You're going to Las Vegas and having a good time at my expense.
What the fuck?
I mean, after all....
SAM:
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
philip:
I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA:
We made a deal.
SAM:
It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity"... had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and demanded money from Tangiers...
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.
ANNA:
I'm not.
philip:
You are.
No, I am not wrong.
...Green tried to stonewall her.
ANNA:
I will see that you don't get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its President, Philip Green.
OBERON:
Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN:
Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
JUDGE:
Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON:
Thank you.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
That's not good.
nicky:
She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start counting her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
REPORTER:
Any comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
What are you talking about?
REPORTER:
She was found last night shot in the head.
MAN:
Was this just a real estate partnership?
MAN 2:
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
MAN:
Did you ever hear of the.22 calibre killer?
SAM:
Now, Instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green, too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with other real estate deals, and things.
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the Chairman of the Board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
PAT:
Have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties...
"says that he is the real boss of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."
PAT:
Do you believe that?
official:
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.
Has that man even filed for his licence yet?
I don't know.
We have to check the files.
Without getting your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.
PAT:
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation of Tangiers executive...
Sam Rothstein's application for a gaming licence is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino....
[Phone rings]
Hello?
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
nicky:
No, it's okay.
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible.
It's booked up, and it's very difficult to get in.
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
All right.
The battle between state gaming officials and Tangiers casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law-enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organised crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with organised crime figure, Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardised by a boyhood friendship?
SAM:
Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
NEWSCASTER:
At 6:00, will a boyhood friendship... unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
Go down.
Just go downstairs.
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.
It's just a political witch hunt.
SAM:
Do you want something to drink?
-Charlie, you want a refill?
-Yeah, that would be great.
I don't want nothing.
Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.
-You're tougher to get than the President.
-I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fucking head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm coming out ofjail... hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fucking head open again.
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like that.
nicky:
You fat lrish prick!
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.
-You think he got the point?
-What are you doing?
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the fbi.
That prick's been dodging me for three weeks.
-You're trying to tell me what to do?
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
You're way out of line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.
If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me... you're gonna have to go my way.
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
SAM:
I got $100 million a year going through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that licence.
Believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fucking licence.
I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a licence.
I don't know what it is, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
-No, I don't want to come along with you.
-All right.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my licence.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
It's taken out of context.
I had no control.
Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you?
-What happened to you?
You lost control?
-I lost control?
You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat people with disrespect.
Even your own wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?
No, that's not the fucking point.
The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life.
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
A week ago it was.
Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.
Right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy's gonna run to the fbi.
nicky:
Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.
SAM:
I knew what he wanted and I didn't want any part of it.
He wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
He also stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
They questioned Nicky.
When some guys who didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
nicky:
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.
nicky:
If a guy tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Be nice.
nicky:
The bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealing with degenerate animals out here.
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sitting on their asses drinking anisette.
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fucking bosses think it's a fucking free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
I heard.
Everybody's talking about it and making a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
That's no good.
Tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
nicky:
Fucking bosses smoking their Di Nobilis... and eating trip' and fucking soffrit', fried pigs' guts... while if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.
-What do they care?
Long as I send money.
-They're complaining.
Let them complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
nicky:
Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
FRANK:
It's up to you.
nicky:
They want a fucking war?
I'm ready.
If I take care of five of those guys, the rest will fall into place.
nicky:
Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
SAM:
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself, but on me, too.
The FBI watched every move he made, but he just didn't care.
nicky:
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch them back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment from the same places that sell to the CIA.
I had all the special police frequency radios, FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....
So, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.
SAM:
I got my job on the line, he's having the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watching him, and he's out playing golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my licence hearing coming up and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
If I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us with the books and papers.
That'll mean a lot when you go before the commission.
-All I ask is a fair hearing.
-This honesty will guarantee it.
[Plane engine sputtering]
We'll move on to....
SAM:
I want to hear about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this fucking guy gonna land, in the fairway?
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
SAM:
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.
$100, whoever hits the plane.
SAM:
If things weren't bad enough... in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases.
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.
SAM:
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but he mostly complained about his trips to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.
You gotta lay down the law, or they'll make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fucking nickel goes down.
-What's the matter with you?
-Everything's here.
-Since when do you talk like that?
-I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll take the eyes out of his freaking head.
-Again.
-I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."
-That's enough.
-I'm sorry.
SAM:
What happens next, you can't believe it.
Who'd believe the FBI had a wire in the place...
looking for information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what?
What prevents him with the suitcases from taking what he wants?
Nance brings back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
He's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together.
I'll find out.
If it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
I got eyes behind my head.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
I'll hit the two of them in the head with a shovel.
MA:
Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beating me left and right.
ARTlE:
I'm sorry.
I'm upset.
I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.
MA:
Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack.
ARTlE:
I know.
I'm too upset.
SAM:
The damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases... and that's it.
[Sentimental swing music]
ARTlE:
Everything's coming out of my pocket.
I gotta pay.
SAM:
Would you believe this could happen?
ARTlE:
I'm in this to make money, not lose it.
SAM:
Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now.
ARTlE:
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
SAM:
Piscano, this guy, basically sunk the whole world.
MA:
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
COUNSELLOR:
Members of the Commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
SAM:
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
COUNSELLOR:
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired fbi agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
-Counsellor, before you continue...
-I want to have this marked.... ...this Commission acts on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
COUNSELLOR:
Denying?
SENATOR:
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
-Aye!
-Aye!
Aye!
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
-You have to be kidding.
-Adjourned?
What do you mean?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the fbi reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?
SENATOR:
I was never your guest.
SAM:
Never my guest?
I never comped you?
I don't comp you at least three times a month?
I'd like to answer that at this time.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at the dinner?
SENATOR:
You were wandering around.
SAM:
Was I at that dinner?
SENATOR:
You were wandering.
SENATOR:
You were in the building.
SAM:
I was in the building?
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
SAM:
Give me that much at least!
SENATOR:
Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein... accused top gaming officials of corruption.
...promised me a fair hearing when you were comped at my hotel?
And you asked for copies of your bill to put on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming licence denial...
Bullshit!
...Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
You guys think you have the right to pass judgement!
NEWSREADER:
Long suspected of running Tangiers without a licence... yesterday's hearing was to determine if someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
REMO:
Fucking hypocrites!
-What the hell's he gonna do now?
-I don't know.
What's he doing?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
Won't be the best, but what are we gonna do?
REMO:
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.
ANNOUNCER: [On TV] Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new sports book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best U.S. football handicapper.
A man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
Now, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
Mr. Sam Rothstein.
[Audience applauding]
[Band playing upbeat dance music]
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein show.
We're happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy... who is a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
PAT:
Keep an eye on him.
frankie:
I've got a large family.
SAM:
How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say, eight children.
-That's amazing.
-There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
[Audience laughing]
philip:
Ace, don't do it.
Jesus.
He's juggling!
SAM:
Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
ANDY:
What the hell is he doing on television?
He's on all night, screaming about taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fucking mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
SAM:
First, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
SAM:
We're on the list to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.
These guys don't care about the Supreme Court.
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
What do you do about that?
-What are you proposing?
-I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?
-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
-lf he took a break... it would give everybody time to manoeuvre.
I would forget about the manoeuvre.
I would just get out.
[Sighs]
I can't do that.
SAM:
Of course, as soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
I've got to do some shopping.
Want to go?
SAM:
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
On routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
ginger:
I got a sprained fucking elbow.
Meet me at 3:00.
-At Caesar's?
-100 yards further down the road.
-Why?
-Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the same outfit.
ginger:
I saw something.
Something very cute.
AGENT:
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
He's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
SAM:
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around anymore.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
[Upbeat rock music]
SAM:
Meeting in the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of coming back alive... from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
Where the fuck you get off talking to people behind my back?
-What people?
-Did you think I wouldn't find out?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
You said I'm bringing heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of you?
You're ordering me out?
You better get your own fucking army!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
You want me to get out of my own fucking town?
Yeah, let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.
You know that you only have your fucking casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.
And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?
I get calls from back home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You could've had the food-and-beverage job without going on TV!
-You wanted to go on TV.
-Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
I'm known.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
You brought down so much heat on me.
Every time I meet somebody, they ask me if I know you.
Sure, now you wanna blame your fucking licence on me.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
I knew you'd come out no matter what I said.
Do you remember?
Back up a fucking minute here.
One minute.
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
nicky:
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally....
Every fucking wise guy still around will take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fucking warned.
Don't go over my fucking head again, you motherfucker, you!
[Rhythmic pop music]
Well, we got company.
Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he acts like he doesn't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Forget about it.
Don't let it bother you.
Does it look like it's bothering me?
Why do I give a fuck?
Oscar, too.
All the money I gave him, that prick.
He didn't even look over.
What's his fucking problem?
-Fucking Jews stick together, don't they?
-They're having a good time.
So are we.
[Phone ringing]
Yeah?
-Sam, we got a problem.
-What is it?
billy:
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about $10,000.
Now he's really pissed.
-He wants a $50,000 marker.
-Just give him $10,000.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
He's gonna come up with $10,000 just the way you want.
No, I said fucking $50,000!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take it but don't wanna give it back.
[Upbeat rock music]
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
Do you give a fuck?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fucking mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
nicky:
Sherbert send you in here to rob me now?
Been fucking knocking everybody's dick in all night?
Been beating the customers?
Jag-off.
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
Keep looking at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep looking at him for?
You fucking....
Look at this, 20 paints in a row.
Hit me again.
nicky:
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
-You gotta get out of here.
-Tell this motherfucker to pay that marker.
You're not listening.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
-Just give me the money.
-I'm gonna okay you $10,000, that's it.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
$10,000 and that's it.
What are you staring at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
-Come on.
Let's get out of here.
-Sue me, you Jew fuck!
nicky:
Get out of here?
I got a marker coming.
Deal.
I know, but everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 1 1:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Coming right back to me... or finding some other excuse to come....
We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things and leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.
SAM:
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
SAM:
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life, a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
Everything all right?
SAM:
What could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
OPERATOR:
Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
The Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills.
receptionist:
Hello, Beverly Hotel.
SAM:
Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
receptionist:
Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
receptionist:
Yes, they both checked out.
SAM:
Thank you.
[Phone ringing]
Hello.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife named Lester Diamond.
My daughter's with them.
They're gonna try and kidnap her.
SAM:
Is there anybody you can send?
MAN:
We'll take care of it.
[Doorbell rings]
We got a number and an address.
SAM:
Hello.
Is this Lester?
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
SAM:
I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
LESTER:
I wouldn't.
You shouldn't do this.
SAM:
You understand?
Put her on the fucking phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
LESTER:
So, listen, can I call you back in a few minutes?
SAM: 702-472-1862.
LESTER:
I'll call back.
SAM:
Right away.
-Right back.
-You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
LESTER:
You want to get back at this prick?
LESTER:
You got what, $2 million in that box?
You got a minute?
He's got $2 million in the box, right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash... and the only other thing he cares about.
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
AMY:
I don't want to go to Europe.
LESTER:
Shut your mouth.
AMY:
You shut up.
LESTER:
Want me to come over?
LESTER:
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
-Lester, he called you here.
-Right.
Ace was on the phone.
-I just talked to him.
-So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell....
ginger:
Yeah, he's sitting by the phone waiting for you to call him back!
What are we gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fucking house!
-It's this fucking bullshit of yours!
-Get your bag!
Let's go!
-What bullshit?
You want to talk it over?
-Are you done yakking?
Go!
Get in the car!
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
ginger:
I think he's gonna kill me.
nicky:
Relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back in an hour at this number...
-and you'll be there, right?
-I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy.
You all right?
Okay, bye.
ginger:
Knock it off.
LESTER:
She started it.
She started the whole thing.
-Don't even think you're gonna drive.
-I'm gonna drive.
SAM:
I'm not gonna drive with a crazy woman.
You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we....
[Pop music plays loudly on radio]
Ginger called me.
Yeah?
nicky:
I just told you she called me.
SAM:
What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
She's with that cocksucker again.
They got Amy.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
This is family.
It ain't business.
Meanwhile, you made calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
SAM:
Driving me fucking crazy.
nicky:
I think if you... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fucking crazy.
nicky:
Once you get her here, think about it.
Wait till you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
[Phone rings]
SAM:
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane to get her here right away.
SAM:
That's all I'm asking.
ginger:
Do you....
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is--
Do you think if I came back....
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
-What about the money?
Where's the box?
-I gotta tell you...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
SAM:
What's it under?
ginger:
Pretty serious.
SAM:
How serious?
ginger:
It's under $25,000.
SAM:
It's under $25,000?
ginger:
Yeah.
SAM:
The $2 million is still there?
ginger:
Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his $25,000.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
$25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch, too.
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?
GlNO:
Good evening, signora.
This way.
SAM:
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but $25, 000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch, too.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice... he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000 at the most, which is impossible for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, $1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
-Around $10,000?
-Would you knock it off, Sam?
SAM:
I'm just trying to figure it out.
ginger:
There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
But I've been told before, "We're working it out."
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favour to me?
Counting the watch, let's say another $4,000 for expenses this weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fucking piece of shit had a good fucking time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're looking at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed.
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fucking actress.
SAM:
You can fucking get pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fucking pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
SAM:
Lucky he's fucking living.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you had run away, he would have been dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
ginger:
No, it isn't fair.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fucking deal?
I go....
Listen, I just can't fucking take it.
Why should I fucking take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fucking past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
ginger:
I want him killed.
I've had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
SAM:
Hello.
ginger:
Yes, I do!
ginger:
I fucking hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fucking guts!
SAM:
You hate my guts?
I want you to come with me now!
SAM:
I want you out of here!
Take your fucking bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
-You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
-The arrangement is over.
SAM:
No kidding!
ginger:
And I still get my money.
I need some cash now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You've never been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
SAM:
You're lower than a dog!
ginger:
Fuck you!
Here!
Is this enough money?
Will it last you two fucking days?
Take it!
Greedy bitch.
Take the fucking money.
I'm going to the bank...
-and I'm getting my jewellery, too!
-lt opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
ginger:
I'm taking Amy.
SAM:
You're not.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
SAM:
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
I am not!
She's my daughter, too!
SAM:
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fucking-damn you!
ginger:
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cut me out of my end!
ginger:
Fucker!
[Car engine stops]
[Car door closes]
[Approaching footsteps]
SAM:
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
Later, I realised I didn't want to give her the money because if I did...
I knew I'd never see her again.
Have a good day at school, okay?
Okay, angel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
SAM:
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
SAM:
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
nicky:
What are you supposed to do?
What do you wanna do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it....
It's not my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
-I was just--
-What?
-Nothing.
-What were you gonna say?
-I don't--
-Tell me what you were gonna say.
Yeah?
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewellery out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You know he's never gonna give me my jewellery.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there, too.
He's so fucking lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
No, he wouldn't.
I would have.
-He'd have been right, too.
Seriously.
-Come on.
You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I didn't.
I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
You did.
You're right.
I like that.
-That's what I like, you did the right thing.
-I did what you told me to.
-Yes, you did.
-You always tell me the right thing to do.
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
-He sure did.
-Everything went to his head.
Changed.
-He did.
He ain't the same person.
-No, he's not.
-He really thinks who the fuck he is.
-Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fucking guts.
Come on, you're a toughie.
You can take this.
nicky:
Don't cry.
ginger:
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
-I never know what he's gonna do.
-Come on.
-Don't be scared.
-I need some help.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
-ls that what you want?
-Yeah.
-A sponsor?
-Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
I'll take care of you.
ginger:
Thank you.
nicky:
It's what you want, isn't it?
[Sentimental RB music]
MAN:
That's Ace's wife.
MAN 2:
This is great for the boss.
[Approaching car]
[Door banging]
ginger:
Hi.
SAM:
Hi.
SAM:
You didn't answer your beeper.
ginger:
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do it.
I know that you want me to, but....
I'm driving down the freeway and the fucking thing beeps.
ginger:
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
SAM:
I put her to bed.
ginger:
I got your cigarettes.
ginger:
Oscar wants you to call him.
SAM:
So who'd you go to lunch with?
ginger:
Jennifer.
SAM:
Where'd you go?
ginger:
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
ginger:
I had a salad.
SAM:
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
-Why do you want to do that?
-You know why I want to do it.
-Just do it.
-Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
jennifer:
Hello?
SAM:
Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
SAM:
I knew she fucked around.
Yeah, she did what she did, and I did what I had to do, but...
Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
SAM:
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
SAM:
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
[Both panting]
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
SAM:
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
REMO:
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie, the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
FRANK:
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up getting killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up getting killed, too.
-No, I ain't seen anything like that.
-Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
-He's good, he's fine.
-I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
-Do it for me.
-No problem.
You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardising anything for our friends.
You understand?
-I understand.
-Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
SAM:
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
FRANK:
You must've drank too much.
nicky:
Fuck yourself.
SAM:
One night, he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix....
Maybe Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
-What do you guys want?
-Police!
Stay in the car!
SAM:
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
COP:
Drop the gun!
BLUE:
Fuck you!
SAM:
The cops shot Blue... because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
They could have been right, but who knows?
COP:
Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.
COP 2:
What do you want?
It's pitch black.
COP 2:
It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
COP:
You moron!
COP:
I'll be doing paperwork for two months!
COP 2:
What'll we do?
COP 2:
Sorry!
COP:
You jerk-off!
SAM:
To make matters worse... to get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths... because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money.
FRANK:
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
nicky:
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
FRANK:
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
nicky:
What'd you tell him?
FRANK:
I told him I didn't know nothing.
FRANK:
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
nicky:
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
FRANK:
No, you would have heard something.
nicky:
What's to stop him?
FRANK:
I know.
nicky:
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
FRANK:
But they keep asking about it.
nicky:
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
nicky:
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a war or something.
nicky:
I'm not sure yet.
But you know what I want you to do?
nicky:
Who's this guy?
FRANK:
That ain't nobody.
nicky:
You know what I want you to do?
nicky:
Get some guys to dig a hole in the desert and show you where it's at.
FRANK:
Angelo and Buster.
nicky:
I'm not sure yet.
FRANK:
They'll do it.
nicky:
When I'm ready, I'll say the words:
"Go see the Jew." And you make it disappear.
Know what I mean?
FRANK:
Let me know.
But you gotta be ready.
FRANK:
You know what I'm talking about?
nicky:
Did I say to do anything yet?
nicky:
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
nicky:
Where are these pricks at?
They're in the motel?
FRANK:
There or in the fucking bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.
[Loud dance music]
[Phone ringing]
[Phone continues ringing]
I'll be right back.
Any calls for me, give them to Mr. Sherbert.
-Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
-I'm going home for a few seconds.
He's on his way home.
Okay.
Hello?
Ginger?
AMY:
Help, Daddy!
SAM:
Amy!
SAM:
Amy, open the door!
AMY:
I can't!
I'm tied!
[Amy screams]
AMY:
Dad!
SAM:
What happened?
SAM:
Who did this to you?
AMY:
Mummy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose.
AMY:
No, please!
SAM:
Okay, I'm gonna be right back.
SAM:
When did this happen, honey?
AMY:
I don't know.
What time did your mother do this?
When did she leave?
AMY:
I don't know.
[Amy moans]
[Phone ringing]
SAM:
Hello?
nicky:
Sammy.
SAM:
Yeah.
Who's this?
nicky:
Me.
nicky:
You okay?
SAM:
No, I'm not okay.
-How'd you know I was here?
-I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
nicky:
Yeah, she's here.
SAM:
I'll be right over.
All right.
-Coming over.
-Great.
[Brakes squealing]
Don't make a scene, all right?
I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She's trying to save your marriage.
Nicky, I want to talk to that fucking bitch.
Be fucking nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
[Sentimental jazz music]
ginger:
Hi.
SAM:
Are you out of your mind?
You tie up our kid and lock the door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your mind?
It was just for a little while.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to have you committed.
You do that again and I'll--
I was just gonna be out for a little while.
She was asleep.
I was gonna be back...
SAM:
Listen.
-...before she even woke up.
-Listen, you fucking cunt...
let me tell you something.
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
You ever touch her again or do anything like that again...
I'll fucking kill you, pure and simple.
SAM:
You hear me?
Pure and simple.
ginger:
Why don't you let me go?
SAM:
I'll kill you.
SAM:
You fucking whore.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewellery, and you to let me go.
SAM:
Want your jewellery?
ginger:
Let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you pig?
SAM:
Get up and be a mother.
Get in the car and go home right now.
Get up and get in....
-Get up.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-I wouldn't do that--
-Get up!
Are you threatening me?
I'll fucking kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.
I'm going!
Now you need approval from him to go home?
So what?
Who blew you in the parking lot before you came in?
You make me sick, you fuck.
-Once a hooker, always a hooker.
-Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
Fuck you!
[Upbeat pop music]
Billy Sherbert, please.
Put him on.
billy:
Who's this?
SAM:
Listen, I'll explain later.
You got a gun at home?
Bring it over right away.
-Take it easy.
I'll do it.
-Okay.
Leave it where it is!
Where is he?
I want that Jew bastard killed!
Hide her car in the back.
ginger:
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
Supposing he goes back home and makes a fucking beef?
-I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me.
-Me?
Nothing.
I said....
I said, no.
Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fucking dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."
If it's so fucking dangerous, why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
-Have him killed, and get it over with!
-Don't be such a fucking smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna whack him for you?
nicky:
Motherfucker.
-I knew it.
-What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?
You think he'll give you money?
Are you out of your mind?
-Look what you did to this guy.
-What?
If you'd just kept your fucking mouth shut.
What's the use!
I should have never got involved--
[Ginger screaming hysterically]
Hey!
You motherfucker, you!
ginger:
You fucker!
nicky:
Get the fuck out!
[Ginger crying]
nicky:
Get the fuck out!
ginger:
No!
nicky:
Get down there!
Take it easy!
nicky:
I shouldn't have gotten involved with this nut!
FRANK:
You'll kill her.
Take it easy.
nicky:
Get her out of here.
FRANK:
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
I'm going to the fbi!
I'm not scared anymore!
nicky:
All right.
Be careful.
ginger:
You've fucked with me for the last time!
Okay.
Yeah.
nicky:
Careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
Look at this.
Motherfucker.
[Frank sighs]
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fucking broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
FRANK:
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fucking spot here.
You know that?
A bad fucking spot.
[Rhythmic pop music]
SAM:
I left the kid with neighbours.
I had $1 million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put this in the hotel safe and I want you to come back.
She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's....
SAM:
Just wait there for me.
ginger:
Get down here and talk to me!
You can't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker!
ginger:
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
ginger:
Get down here and talk to me, God damn it!
ginger:
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
ginger:
I'm going to drive this fucking car through the living room!
ginger:
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
ginger:
Come out here and talk to me.
SAM:
Will you stop it?
SAM:
You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
ginger:
I am not!
-You'll be sorry if you don't stop.
-Don't you threaten me!
ginger:
You're not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
He's my new sponsor!
How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
ginger:
I don't have to take your shit anymore!
I'm going to the fbi!
I'll go to the police!
-I am not protecting you anymore!
-Mrs.
Rothstein--
ginger:
He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, we've been getting some complaints about the noise.
I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy.
I won't, the way she's behaving.
ginger:
Won't let me in?
SAM:
Who knows what you'll do there.
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
-I want to get my things!
Big deal!
-Okay.
Let her in to get a few things.
That way she'll leave.
COP:
This is half her house.
SAM:
I'm afraid.
ginger:
You aren't afraid!
SAM:
She'll destroy stuff.
-Let me in the house!
-Hey!
-Fucker!
-Hold on!
Please!
ginger:
You should be afraid, the way you treat me!
It'll make it easier on everybody.
COP:
If we let her get her things, we'll be out of your hair.
If she calms down, I'll let her in.
ginger:
I am calm!
SAM:
If she calms down...
I will let her in for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she won't leave.
-Can I go in?
-That's not a problem.
-Jeff, would you go in with her?
-Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
ginger:
You wouldn't believe how mean he is.
He's locked up my papers.
I have to get them.
Don't let him come up here... because I know they're in here in the desk.
Fuck.
ginger:
Pay attention.
He could come up here at anytime.
Are you watching for him?
ginger:
Got them.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
It'll just be a couple minutes.
We got other things to do, too.
He'll hurry her up.
-How's everything else?
-Fine.
-How's your family?
-Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.
We're happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing, then we can go.
ginger:
Shit!
Fuck!
ginger:
Shit!
God!
ginger:
That pisses me off!
Don't worry.
It would be great... if you could follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
[Crying] I can't believe this.
ginger:
I just need to pick up a little cash.
Could you come with me?
SAM:
You've got to stop her.
charlie:
I'm sorry, Sam.
charlie:
What can I do?
SAM:
She's a junkie.
She's out of her mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
-but I can't.
-Legally, she can't take it.
SAM:
She can't.
Half of it is mine.
charlie:
Listen to me.
charlie:
There's nothing I can do.
SAM:
I'm coming down.
Shit!
God damn it!
I'll need a bag.
Could you ask the guy for the big bag?
COP:
Go get a bag, man.
ginger:
Here.
-Lady, I can't take it.
-You can.
You've been so nice to me.
ginger:
Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can....
Oh, God!
It's him.
You have to stop him.
'Cause he said he was gonna kill me.
COP:
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
COP:
Hold on a second.
SAM:
She's driving away.
COP:
There's nothing we can do.
-There's nothing we can do.
-Look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
COP:
Nothing we can do.
She had the key.
COP 2:
She's on the account.
-Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station.
-Okay.
Let's do it.
[Siren wailing]
-We're placing you under arrest.
-For what?
-For aiding and abetting--
-For what?
-For aiding and abetting--
-I'm just trying to leave.
SAM:
After all the threats and bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
They had all the pieces they needed.
But I didn't do anything.
SAM:
Everyone began to tumble, like dominoes.
fbi!
We have a warrant!
SAM:
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my licence... paradise.
We managed to really fuck it up.
nicky JR.:
Mum.
jennifer:
Someone's at the door now.
fbi.
We have a federal search warrant.
nicky:
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
-I'm Mark Casper, fbi.
-Yeah?
Can I make a fucking phone call?
Yes, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
fbi AGENT:
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
nicky:
They got almost everybody else.
fbi AGENT:
This area is seized!
-Get the master account list.
-I want all those papers seized.
fbi AGENT:
Put every box on the table.
[Rhythmic jazz music]
Yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
SAM:
Green?
Don't even ask.
-...$30,000 of yours.
-No.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
philip:
I've got nothing to hide.
nicky:
Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
Oh, this is good.
nicky:
He might as well give them a blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
-Those are my mother's books.
-You're under arrest.
nicky:
What a fucking balloon head.
ARTlE:
What are you doing?
AGENT:
Take it easy.
wife:
Wait!
wife:
Wait!
He's sick!
COP:
Move back.
wife:
It's his heart!
Is he breathing?
COP 2:
CPR now!
SAM:
Artie got so upset he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
-Calm down!
-No, I won't calm down!
-He's my husband!
Artie!
-We can't help him if--
SAM:
At the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
fbi AGENT:
Why protect a friend who betrayed you?
SAM:
But I didn't want to look at them... or the guys who brought them.
COUNSELLOR:
Your Honour, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
COUNSELLOR:
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
nicky:
When they were arrested, some were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
COUNSELLOR:
Pre-trial services recommends that bail remain as set.
JUDGE:
Take recess.
nicky:
When it looked like they'd get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming a casino... sick or no fucking sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse.
When something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fucking Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
What do you think?
Look, why take a chance?
At least that's the way I feel about it.
ANDY:
Call Artie.
Tell him I don't care what... he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning.
It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with him.
[Gunshots muffled by silencer]
nicky:
As much as they liked him, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
He thought nobody would find him there.
[Gunshots muffled by silencer]
[Breaking glass]
[Gunshots muffled by silencer]
nicky:
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So....
Where you going, jag-off?
nicky:
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
nicky:
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up getting whacked.
ginger:
Oh, no!
No!
SAM:
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies, and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and jewels.
[intense rock music]
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was $3, 600 in mint condition coins.
[intense rock music continues]
No matter what the Feds or the papers said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that, that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorised, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
So did the powers that be.
nicky:
How are you?
BOSS:
How you doing?
nicky:
It took months for everything to calm down.
But finally, my guys got out on bail.
The bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the fucking dollars.
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
What's right is right.
They don't give a fuck about--
THUG:
Holy fucking....
nicky:
What the fuck....
Come on, motherfucker!
Tough guys!
You and your fucking brother!
You fucking scumbags!
No more!
-Frankie!
-No more!
You see?
Watch!
nicky:
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
FRANK:
Fuck you!
nicky:
Fucking punk!
Piece of shit!
No!
Take this motherfucker out!
[Dominick groaning]
Leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
FRANK:
All right.
Strip him.
nicky:
No balls.
You got no fucking balls.
Oh, Dominick!
nicky:
Dominick.
[Nicky weeping]
FRANK:
Come on.
THUG:
Bury them?
FRANK:
Bury them.
[Nicky moaning]
SAM:
The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
They buried them while they were still breathing.
MAN:
You all right?
Watch out!
MAN:
Mister, you all right?
SAM:
Yeah.
SAM:
They had other ideas for me.
[Sirens wailing]
medic:
We need some help over here!
medic 2:
You sure are lucky, mister.
[Dramatic operatic music]
SAM:
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
While the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mummy and Daddy drop the house payments and junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checking into an airport.
If you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid will want his Social Security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids?
Junk bonds.
SAM:
Still not sure?
SAM:
Probable.
Maybe questionable.
SAM:
All right, let me know as soon as you can find out.
SAM:
In the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that!
[Nostalgic instrumental music]
[Soft jazz music]
When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.
There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.
Otherwise, what's the point?
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.
Before I ever ran a casino, or got myself blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I could change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I'm serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money... $62,700,000.
I don't know all the details.
Nobody knew all the details, but it should've been perfect.
I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had, Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should've been so sweet too.
But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.
At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you're talking about a half hour or 45 minutes of digging'.
And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fuckin' night.
Who could resist?
Anywhere else in the country I was a bookie, a gambler... always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and I went to work.
...the casino manager.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It's like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comp trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.
That's the truth about Las Vegas.
We're the only winners.
The players don't stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the holy of holies, the count room.
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.
Even I couldn't get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.
They had so much fuckin' money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.
And the best part was that upstairs...
- the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.
I mean, to them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify 5,000.
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.
were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standin' in front of about two million dollars... to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise...
- the IRS or anybody.
- Verify 200.
Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way.
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra C-note a week... just to watch the door.
It's routine.
Business as usual:
in, out, hello, good-bye.
And that's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walking' out of the casino with a suitcase.
Now that suitcase was goin' straight to one place:
Right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without gettin' themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all... the bosses ever wanted.
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
- Somethin' smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.
The bosses would come from all over the place:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest.
And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City.
I mean, nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking'.
- Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?
Now, these old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly control Las Vegas.
Mama, that man's here again.
Because they control the Teamsters Union.
And that's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.
- Would you put in shrimp?
- I would.
Here you are, gentlemen.
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
- Definitely the most important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.
- That's around 700,000.
- Uh-huh, good.
I know it's a little early for Las Vegas... but I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry.
As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.
He even played golf with the president.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.
And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... this check for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
he did what he was told.
Now, here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.
He didn't want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money.
He wanted to believe the Teamsters... gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart.
I know full well how much competition we have in this great city.
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money... to come and pick up his own fuckin' check.
And of course it was the bosses' man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the chairman of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.
I understand.
I understand.
Now all they needed was... somebody they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fuckin' place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot at runnin' a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to.
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.
I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The state law says that you can work in a casino... while they're processing your application.
They got a ten-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out?
We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?
They'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
They take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys been workin' there for 30 years, don't have a license.
It's a tough proposition, Andy.
You know if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious, no interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
And that's how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15 years old, and he always made money.
But he didn't bet like you or me.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly.
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.
He had to know everything, this guy.
He'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew... and that's what he'd put his money on.
Even back home, years ago... when we were first hanging' out... he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...
I'll take Columbia for 20.
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the different bounce... you got off the different kinds of wood they used... on college basketball courts, you know?
He'd be workin' on this shit day and night.
There was nothing about a game he was gonna bet that he didn't know.
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that's just the way he was.
But back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck... about whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost...
Cazzo!
All those fuckin' sweeps.
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
I mean, fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fuckin' zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fuckin' Remo everything.
And to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
- Hey!
- Keepin' Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi-- How the hell'd you do it?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
You see?
Never tells me nothin'.
What do we got on for next week?
Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.
Is that all right?
- Okay, you'll come by the house?
- I'll come by.
7:00.
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up?
Okay, Ace?
Hey, Nick.
Vien acca.
- I'll be right out.
- T'aggia parla.
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He's makin' a lot of money for us.
And he's gonna continue making' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there that-- without brains.
- Okay?
- All right.
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah.
Want me to take this for you?
So now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around with the golden Jew.
Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.
Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
- They all made money with us.
- They paying'?
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week, like they're supposed to.
- Don't ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don't see any money.
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.
Who's this guy?
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine.
I laid nine.
- It was eight.
Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.
- Eight.
- If he don't know, nobody knows.
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?
'Cause you're a jag-off.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Is this yours?
Your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen.
Why?
No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.
I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen... and shove it up your ass, you fuckin' jag-off.
- Well, I was just offering you the--
- This fuckin' assho--
Look out, Joe.
Look out.
What's that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?
Hear a little girl, Ace?
ls that a little fuckin' girl?
What happened to the fuckin' tough guy...
- told my friend to stick it up his fuckin' ass?
- Nicky, take it easy.
Nicky, Nicky.
While I was trying to figure out why the guy was saying... what he was saying, Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him... because he'll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
Listen, with me protecting' Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
I mean, that's what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.
In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the, you know, good old boys.
I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shoveling mule shit.
Ward, you've got to keep a cleaner space.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him, all right?
Won't happen again, Sam.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein.
Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
What's the story?
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
Thank you very much, Senator.
- They passed the laws, they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room.
- I had dozens of politicians and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.
coming through that place every week.
- Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.
Why not make him happy?
...the Presidential Suite.
For politicians like our State Senator up there, everything was on the house.
These guys won their comp life when they got elected... so, hey, why not take advantage of it.
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It's a whale like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat... that's the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman lslands.
Downstairs he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and two million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.
I can't understand it.
These mechanical things, you know they happen.
Hey, but better here than up there, you know what I mean.
Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan.
I can't believe that there's a convention; there's no room.
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
- I'm sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet 1,000 a hand, instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.
...to the bank with a natural lead over a five.
But I knew the trick with whales like lchikawa... was that they can't bet small for long.
He didn't think of it as winning 10,000... he thought of it as losing 90,000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.
Six.
All right, who's gonna give me that?
Since the players are looking to beat the casino...
Each and every roll, all right.
- the dealers are watching the players...
- Six.
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.
the floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I'm watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys up there... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
Yes!
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.
Lookin' good.
Lookin' good.
Let's go.
This is for Ginger.
Come on.
Let me have a hundred on your hard ten.
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice--
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You were great.
Thanks.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
- Come on.
- What's the matter?
What do you mean?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I've seen you stealing from me.
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.
- I want my half.
- I've been watching you all night.
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Get lost!
Get lost?
Get lost?
Yes!
Yes!
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!
What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
- Ginger's mission in life was money.
- I'll be right back.
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers... and helped them spread around a lot of money.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?
- And you do.
Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
- How you doin' tonight?
- Good.
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.
- Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.
And that's what Vegas is all about.
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.
- It's kickback city.
- Have a good night.
Thank you.
You too.
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.
pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, she took care of the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... because they took care of the security guards...
- who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.
- No problem.
- You are a doll.
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.
But one thing I just could never understand... was that she could have everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Gin, you know I got other people in this, they got partners.
I want you to understand that I am looking out for you... in this thing, okay?
You're gonna get yours back, and you're gonna get back first, okay?
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?
Where are you?
You're in that place.
Where are you?
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
- You're my woman.
- I know.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag.
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.
And somehow she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
If you find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well.
- That's why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.
- back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.
- Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops.
This time they wanted to pinch him...
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.
- Hold it, hold it.
Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
- And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.
Look at this.
Beautiful!
I mean, that's what worried me.
'Cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
- All right, we're clear.
- There's more.
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What's that?
Huh, what's that?
There's no more.
Thanks, hon.
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn't send me out there to have a good time.
They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?
Hey, Sammy.
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- Incredible.
Welcome to Vegas.
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What've you been doing out here?
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick, they're dear friends of mine.
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you... it's no joke out here, it's no joke.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It's not like back home.
Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us.
And this sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care.
I wanna get away from back home for a while.
I'm tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place, everything's legit.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Ace saw Vegas one way...
- You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
- Of course.
but I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
I mean, they had bookies, pimps... and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started gettin' everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
Yeah, he had a foolproof scheme, all right.
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected;
when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves.
What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin'?
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?
Oh, Nicky.
I thought you was layin'.
No, no, I'm takin'.
I was takin'.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window... you'll get unconfused.
- Gimme the fuckin' money.
- I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't mean anything by it.
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?
- My fuckin' head.
- Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president.
George Washington was born--
But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town...
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
Beautiful, you got a beautiful swing.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved in Little League.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches... was a fuckin' metro intelligence cop.
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.
He's gotta realize that everything can't be a home run that he does.
That's exactly what I keep tellin' him... but that's the kind of kid he is.
And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.
They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fuckin' balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of 200 fuckin' grand...
- yeah, right, I'm sure.
- Hey!
How are you?
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm over here now.
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase and then he left.
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's out?
I think maybe he went across the street... or somewhere else or somethin'.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- Yeah, lots of luck.
- Yeah, good luck to you too.
- Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.
Yeah, they don't need those anymore.
Guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
'Cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble.
Even after we'd catch them, they'd try sneaking back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy, he's betting' lavender chips... at 500 each with only one little problem... he's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they're all greedy.
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.
He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Now, here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card... and signaling his buddy at this table.
And that's just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away.
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
They never know what hit them.
And if and when they do find out... that they just got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals... they were knocking this place dead for years.
- He's got a wire on him.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There it is.
That's it.
- Cheater's justice.
- Oh, God!
No, no, no!
I wanted everybody to know... that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks... that the party was over.
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks... with your right hand.
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.
- You can't do it with both hands?
- No, sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I never tried.
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
- It's 100, 110, I think.
- Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hiya.
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don't I take him... over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
And by the way... send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
- Sure will.
- Real special.
- By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
- Hi.
- Having a good time?
- Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice:
You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here.
- What do you want?
- I just wanna get out of here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake.
'Cause if you come back here, and we catch either one of you... we're gonna break your heads, and you won't walk out of here.
You see that fuckin' saw?
We're gonna use it.
You got it?
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.
Throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car.
Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters... the per was way up, the gods were happy.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We're not gettin' any younger.
Don't you think it's time?
Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I'm gonna do you one better.
I'm tryin' to marry you.
You wanna marry me?
I'm serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you.
And I can't think of anybody better to be with.
And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam?
'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, okay.
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.
- All right, all right.
- Understand?
Sam, I'm sorry.
No, l-
- I--
I mean-
- I can grow.
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.
What is love anyway?
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.
It's a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out, doesn't play out... then what happens to me?
You know I'm doing well now, and I'm gonna do even better.
And so whatever happens... if it doesn't work out between us...
I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.
And if there are kids, especially...
I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What are you pitching me?
Just what I said, you'll be set up... for the rest of your life, that I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories.
But I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town, and he knew they'd show.
Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride, even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby before they could get married.
He even made Jenny and me watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
But I didn't mind, we loved the kid.
Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don't make me come there.
Answer me.
I love you.
But, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
You do?
Yeah, I do.
It's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right, in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.
I'm lookin' at you right now.
I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute.
I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
I'm okay, I just--
You just have to understand.
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
I just-
- I don't--
I think I have a right to do that.
Okay?
It's all right.
That part of your life is over with.
- Right?
- Yeah.
You're with me now.
- Yeah.
- Right?
Uh-huh.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Let's go.
Let's go back in.
- Okay.
Oh!
Tsk.
It's great.
It's great.
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can't--
Try it on.
It's yours.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
Nice, isn't it?
No one's ever been so nice to me.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
So, do you think it's too much... if I wear these all on the same day?
You do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
So wonderful.
The jewelry's not so bad either.
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
- What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
- Okay.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this doesn't mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
With over a million in cash and jewels... tucked in a bank in Vegas, only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
So I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank... under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
And since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet.... when I needed the money the most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
This is a signature card.
So once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Yeah, sure I do.
Why?
It's good.
It's just unusual.
Tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
And to play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a license.
I mean Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming his own kind of Vegas.
I put money out on the street charging' three points a week.
- Don't make us come lookin' for you.
- Juice to the fuckin' dealers.
You won't have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
It was so obvious.
- All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics were signal-happy.
- I'm gonna open for 500.
Signaling back and forth.
Why you cryin' with two loaves of bread under your arm?
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.
I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky's a made guy, and I'm not.
I can't do that.
Be careful.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
So I'm lucky.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.
Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place.
A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin' ear...
"This is Las Vegas.
We're supposed to be out here robbin'... you dumb fuckin' hebe."
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.
Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table.
What's he think this is, a goddamned sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table?
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Call security.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
Wanna do me a favor?
Take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on.
Fuck you!
I want you to exit this guy off the premises... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain't goin' anywhere with you.
- Bullshit.
You're outta here.
- Fuck you!
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Leave me alone!
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?
- Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
Come here.
Come here.
You go over there.
You apologize.
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get outta line again, I'll smash your head so hard... you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fuckin' hick.
Sammy, listen.
This guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.
I mean, he's already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...
I swear he'll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he's out for good.
I don't care what it is, I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this, really.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kickin', stinky-horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in the desert.
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I'm sorry.
You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David and their tigers away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a Rolls-Royce.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fuckin' angles.
He brought over the whole "Femme Fatale" show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like balloons.
She's still eight pounds over.
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.
Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them--
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I guess she's frightened.
If she doesn't lose weight she may get fired.
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--
- It's been our policy--
- Just stop everything!
- This woman's an institution.
- That's the problem.
She's lazy.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So, he took bookie joints off the street... and then opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years by doing all of this... he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off of him.
Between my innovations... and Nicky's dedication to his job...
I soon had the best operation on the strip.
You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why?
Somebody's complaining'?
I'm hearing things from security.
The sheriff's lookin' to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
They got two names from the whole country... and one of 'em is still AI Capone.
If they put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.
You will not be able to walk into a casino.
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.
I'm just tellin' you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
All right.
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
Back home, they would've put me in jail for what I'm doing.
But out here, they're giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... for charitable donations to greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife, Ginger, work the room.
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.
We'd love to have you there.
- Yes, okay.
- Great.
She made everybody feel good.
Congratulations, Sam.
Oh, thanks.
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
- Hi.
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fuckin' kid!
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!
they didn't know what really moved her.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Daddy gave me this--
And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin' back there?
You can't even see 'em there.
- Okay, I'll--
- What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
- Well--
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.
- The action is in the front.
Bring 'em up front.
- All right, I will.
Listen to me very carefully.
There are three ways of doing things around here:
the right way, the wrong way and the way that I do it.
- You understand?
- I do understand that.
I'll get right on it.
- And thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Just do it.
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right, Mr. Rothstein.
I am so sorry.
So I ended up working-- what, 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get something out of it.
Well, it wasn't long... before what I was afraid was gonna happen happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas.
And from then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"He will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000... every time he shows up."
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it.
You got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation--"
Motherfucker!
Is there any way around this?
No, there's no way.
Let's say, for instance...
I wanna go in a restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can't even set foot in the parking lot.
That's how serious it is.
In other words, I'm fucked?
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.
I mean, you're listed in there with AI Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.
They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
So, once they pulled that shit...
I started doin' my own things nobody ever thought of doin'.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados... and started knocking' over high-rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers-- anybody right here in town.
I had a good fuckin' crew goin' for me, I'll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy.
He worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
And I opened up my own jewelry store too, the "Gold Rush."
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.
But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off looking at me... so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
- What's takin' so long?
- This is a motherfucker!
- It's working.
- Learn how to open these things so you don't have to take 'em.
Some of these stones got a lot of niggers in them.
Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he better take a camel back to Nigeria.
- Yeah?
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
- All right.
Thanks.
He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen.
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.
- Valet parkers.
- They're just checking in now.
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.
- 1230.
Right.
- Secretaries.
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition?
All right.
And they all got a piece of the score.
Car's coming.
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else... if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
What the fuck they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?
You know, this diamond has flaws in it.
- There's no flaws.
- I'm doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws.
Whenever we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
What, are you gonna have a fucking meeting here?
I know his language.
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.
Twenty thousand.
That's my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk Turkey here.
Twenty-five thousand.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault... where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush... in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.
She used to fall asleep on the couch watching TV.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't even supposed to be doin' it.
The bosses were making so much fucking money with the casinos... that they didn't want anybody making' any waves for them.
You gave all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?
That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came here.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet?
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.
You will try to push it through, won't you, Mr. Clark?
- Yes.
- I'm giving you 50,000 cash.
Then I put some more money into legitimate places, like my restaurant.
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Fuckers.
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.
Enjoy.
Have a good time.
Choke on it, motherfucker.
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin'?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with it.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over the place.
That show over at the Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said, whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls, naturally.
I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star.
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.
- Hey, Shelly.
How are you?
- Hi.
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.
- This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
Come on.
I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days.
It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?
You know you're a lyin' lowlife, motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
Your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off.
And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money?
- No?
You didn't?
- I didn't--
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck outta me.
You wanna embarrass me and make a fool outta me?
You didn't gamble?
Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money...
I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on!
Did you gamble?
Huh?
Fuckin' degenerate.
Fuckin' kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck outta here.
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.
Let me find out you fucked up.
I'll leave you where I find you.
How many of these you gonna eat?
- Two.
- Two?
But around 6:30 in the morning, when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?
- Not a lot.
You know why, right?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- 'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.
Every couple of weeks, I used to send Marino... back to the bosses with a piece of what I made.
Not a bit piece, but what did they know?
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do...
I would carry things out to a "T."
Like the time Tony Dogs, who's supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo's bars.
Here's a fuckin' guy kills two of Remo's guys... and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just workin' on her night off, of all things.
I mean, this guy's just beggin' to be made an example of.
Frankie, I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
And I don't care what you have to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?
- I'll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow 'em down.
To be truthful with you, I had to admire this guy.
He was one of the toughest lrishmen I ever met.
- This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two fuckin' nights we beat the shit outta this guy.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
- Better give me a name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.
- But he never talked.
- I know you would've ratted by now.
In the end, I had to put his fuckin' head in a vise.
Dogs, Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.
I'll squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.
Don't make me have to do this.
Please.
Come on!
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Come on.
Fuck you!
This motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fuckin' days and nights.
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
ls that what you're tellin' me?
- You motherfucker, you!
Huh?
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M.
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.
You make me pop your fuckin' eye outta your head... to protect that piece of shit, Charlie M.?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!
You motherfucker, you!
Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
The word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
Charlie M.
Four reels, sevens, across three $15,000 jackpots.
Do you have any idea what the odds are?
It's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn't you call me?
It happened so quick.
Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.
- You didn't see the scam?
- There's no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
They won!
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.
What's the matter with you?
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
I think you're overreacting.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel.
I've been carrying your ass ever since I got here.
- Get your ass outta here.
- You're firing me?
I'm firing you.
No, I'm not firing--
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.
This is not the way to treat people.
If you didn't know, you're too fuckin' dumb.
If you did know, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.
Get out.
Come on.
Let's go.
The guy's history as far as I'm concerned.
But you can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a commissioner.
This is his state.
His uncle's chief judge.
His brother-in-law runs the county commission.
You're in the finances, you're upstairs.
But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.
I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.
There is not one single thing I will not catch.
- Look at yours.
Look at that.
- Huh?
Look at this.
There's nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
What are you talking about?
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
- What do you need?
- Got her?
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don't you take it out of your account?
I would, you know, Sam, it's just that--
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?
What's the difference?
I just need it.
Well, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.
You're not asking for a box of popcorn.
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.
Okay?
We don't have to have a fight.
It's important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.
Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.
Why can't you tell me what it's for?
Huh?
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for 25,000.
What do you want, a coat?
- No.
- If you want a coat, you got it.
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
Sam, I've been independent my whole life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
- Now you're making me beg.
- What are you talking about?
And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?
You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
You know, it's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
Can I trust you?
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you could tell me what the money is for.
Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.
All right, I'm gonna follow her.
What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
It means I got the money.
Yes, you're way up on top now.
How are you doin', Les?
It's Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
If I'm wrong, please correct me.
'Cause I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine too.
Go ahead.
Take it.
'Cause you already have hers.
She's my wife.
Look at me.
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew that she's my wife?
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah, I know that.
You know, yeah?
But if you ever come back again, ever... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man.
Don't be a fucking pimp.
Now, you wanna do me a favor?
Get outta here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get up and get outta here.
- And you want to be free.
Why, you feel that you are too good... much too good for a nobody like me.
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- That's fuckin' bullshit.
- Well, darling, I guess it's best...
- that we should part.
Remember when you called him that night and said good-bye?
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."
- He didn't say that to you, did he?
- No, he didn't.
No.
Instead, what did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."
Come here.
I want to show you something.
- The second letter came right after I gave you your start.
- No!
No!
No!
No!
Make 'em stop it!
- No!
No!
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!
No!
- Fuck!
Fuck!
- Piece of shit.
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He's such a prick!
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn't want to do it himself.
Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands dirty.
So why did he have to do that, huh?
Tell me.
- I know it wasn't a nice thing to do--
- No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down--
No.
No.
I told him all about this guy before we ever got married.
- This is no fucking surprise.
- Oh, you did?
I didn't know that.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
You know, the first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open, you know.
I knew the bottom could drop out at any time.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this... if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?
So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.
You mean like a lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I'm just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?
A million dollars in jewelry.
Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you?
I should've never married him.
He's a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.
I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
You know, this is probably not-- I don't have the answers anyway.
- This is probably not what you want to hear...
- I do.
'cause you're a little upset, and I understand that.
But I think you should try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could've killed him!
Okay?
He could've killed him.
He didn't have to hit him.
It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What is that all about?
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl.
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this.
You're so nice.
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.
-Thanks.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?
Uh, no.
No, thank you, little lady.
Okay, send him in.
Then call me four minutes after.
- Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
- How do you do?
- Hey, it is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well.
Hey, all that money is rollin' in.
I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor civil servant.
- Why don't you have a seat, hmm?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I come here personally to kind of smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
See, uh, maybe you didn't know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends.
Nice family and their money go back many, many years.
Now friends vote.
Family and money votes.
That's important to me and you.
And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines-- and you'll forgive me for sayin' it-- maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
That means, either he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was goin' on.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Are, uh--
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.
What you're saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be very helpful to that kid.
He's weak.
He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.
There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favor... if you'd think some more on hiring' him back.
I can't do that.
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law... and I do want to help you and I like to do favors.
I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.
He's too incompetent, and the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Okay.
Thanks.
Well... you know, that's it.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests.
But you act like you're at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.
But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the governor.
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- You bet.
What happened to my pills?
Huh?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinking too much?
You're taking my pills too?
I didn't take your pills.
Look, for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these.
And that's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with 'em?
You didn't have to beat him up.
What?
I was just trying to help him.
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring about people.
What?
What?
I said, you can't make me... stop caring about people.
Listen...
Ginger...
I'm trying to make the best of everything here, you know?
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.
I mean, people look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit!
I'm gettin' out of here.
I am.
Come over here.
You gotta get hold of yourself.
- Okay.
Okay.
- If not for me, at least for Amy.
Understand?
Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand.
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.
That's all you care about.
You don't care about me.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that fuckin' leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Okay?
You'll do it.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
I will.
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rollin' in... and the suitcases kept comin' and goin'.
And let me tell you, the fuckin' bottom line here is... cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin' a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Huh?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
Even John Nash-- that's the guy who ran the scam-- he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the purpose.
Huh?
They take this money because they're my guys, so give 'em some leeway.
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K.C.... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
- What were you doin'?
- I was with my cumma.
- What are you doin' with your cumma?
- I gave her a scheff.
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
- What you been doin'?
- I'm out there more than I'm here.
And little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they'd would've been better off makin' fuckin' novena.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
- I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
- What expenses?
I'm layin' money outta my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping' records.
No records, Artie.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I keep laying' out my own fuckin' dough.
What the hell are we doin' over here?
You're goin' to Las Vegas at my expense.
Oh, fuck.
I mean, after all--
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next.
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- We made a deal.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr. Integrity... had a partner nobody knew about.
And when she showed up and started demanding money--
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're wrong.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.
Green tried to stonewall her.
I will see to it that you do not get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its president, Phil Green.
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
Hey, that's not good.
She was doin' pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start countin' her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
Can you comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
- What are you talking about?
- She was found last night shot in the head.
Was this just a real estate partnership?
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
Did you ever hear of the .22
Caliber Killer?
Now, instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with real estate deals.
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
Hmm, have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties... says that he is the real boss of the $100 million...
Tangiers casino empire."
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.
Has that man even filed for his license yet?
I don't know.
We have to check the files.
Without gettin' your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And kinda check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass outta town.
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation... of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein's application... for a gaming license is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino--
- Hello?
- I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?
- You can't.
- You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
- No, no.
It's impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.
It's very difficult to get in.
I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.
All right.
The battle between State gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?
- Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Huh?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
At 6:00:
Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
- Go down.
Just... go downst-
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry.
It's just a political witch hunt.
Ace.
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.
No.
Hey, Mr. Clark.
I've been tryin' to reach you.
- You're tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
- You know, I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and, uh, if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail... hopefully you'll be comin' out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fuckin' head open again.
'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat lrish prick!
You put my money to sleep!
- Get my money, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, Fatso.
You fuckin' try me.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'?
He's a square guy, for chrissakes.
He's gonna run to the F.B.I.
That prick's been dodging' me for three weeks.
You're tryin' to tell me what to do.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You're outta line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fuckin' balls?
I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together here.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
If you're actin' like this now, can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that license.
If it goes bad for me, it's bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fuckin' license.
I plant my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.
You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
That's taken out of context.
I had no control over that.
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?
- What happened to you?
You lost control.
- I lost control?
Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fuckin' cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you been treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you her tell about your little role in that situation?
No, that's not the fuckin' point.
- The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
- I would appreciate it... if you stay out of my personal life.
- You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?
- Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
- It's none of my business?
A week ago it was.
Now it's none of my business.
When you need me, you need me.
The way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy is gonna run to the F.B.I. now.
Your head's bigger than your casino.
I knew what he wanted.
Nicky wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
Plus, he had stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
- They questioned Nicky.
When some guys that didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every one of those newspapers.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over, there.
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Come on, be nice, huh?
And the bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealin' with degenerate animals out here.
But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sittin' on their asses drinking' anisette.
I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fuckin' bosses think it's a fuckin' free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
- Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Everybody's talkin'.
They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
And I mean, that's no good.
You gotta tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Fuckin' bosses;
they're smokin' their Di Nobilis... and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin' suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.
If I want to talk private, I gotta go to a bus stop.
- What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?
- They're complaining'.
Let 'em complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
- Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.
- It's up to you.
They want a fuckin' war?
I'm ready.
All I gotta do is take care of five of those guys.
The rest will fall into place.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me too.
The F.B.I. watched every move he made, but he didn't care.
He just didn't care.
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch 'em right back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I. de-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.
And because of that, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doin' anything.
I got my job on the line, and this guy's havin' the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up, and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.
That's gonna mean something when you go before the commission.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.
- All right, well, we'll move on to--
- I wanted to hear something about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this guy gonna land, the fairway?
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the Control Board.
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.
And as if things weren't bad enough, in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they bought the suitcases.
Fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple grand.
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but mostly what he did was complain about his trips to Vegas.
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise they're gonna make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fuckin' nickel goes down.
Receipts--
- Hey, oh, wha-- What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
- Again.
- I said, "frickin' head."
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
What happens next?
You can't believe it.
Who would believe that the F.B.I. had a wire in the place...
Iookin' for some information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked-out God knows when over God knows what.
What's to prevent him with the suitcases that he could take what he wants?
Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
You believe this bullshit?
Sure, he's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together, those fucks.
I'll find out.
If it's Green, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
- I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.
- Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beatin' me left and right.
- Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm all upset.
- I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doin'.
I can't take this no more.
Back and forth.
- Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
- I know.
I'm too upset.
And the damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas and the casinos and suitcases... and that's it.
Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.
Would you believe that such a thing could happen?
I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.
Every F.B.I. man across the country had their ears open now.
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
I mean, Piscano, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired F.B.I. agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counselor, before you continue--
- I want to have this marked--
This commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean, "Adjourned"?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the F.B.I. reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest?
I never comped you?
- I don't comp you at least three times a month?
- I'd like to answer that.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was with Barney Greenstein.
- Was I at that dinner?
Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.
- Was I at that dinner?
Was I?
- You were wandering.
- You were... in the-- You were in the building.
- I was in the building?
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Did you not?
Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
You son of a--
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...
- What are you runnin' for, Bob?
- accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
You promised me when you were getting comped at my hotel.
You were asking me for copies of your bill so you could put 'em on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...
- Bullshit!
Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
But you guys think you have the right to pass judgment!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license... yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fuckin' hypocrites!
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.
What's he doin'?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
What are we gonna do?
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quick
Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new Sports Book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America;
a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
- Mr. Sam Rothstein.
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.
We're very happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy, who is... a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
- Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
- Keep an eye on him.
- I've got a large family.
- How many kids do you have?
- I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
- No, no, please.
Please.
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
- Ace, don't do it.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jesus.
He's juggling!
Let's not take Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fuckin' mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
We're on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States.
These guys don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
How can I walk away?
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
He pissed 'em off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for awhile.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain't sending' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break... it would give everybody time to maneuver.
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.
I can't do that.
As soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
Great.
You know, I've got to do some shopping.
You want to go?
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
So on routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, I got a sprained fuckin' elbow.
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards down the road.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit.
I saw something.
Something very cute.
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of comin' back alive... from a meetin' with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people behind my back, goin' over my head?
- What people?
- What people?
What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about.
You said I'm bringin' heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of your shit?
You're ordering' me out?
You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?
- Yeah.
Let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass.
It's not yours.
It's my ass.
I don't know whether you know you have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!
And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You understand.
You could have had the food-and-beverage job without goin' on television!
You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
That's right.
You're makin' a spectacle of yourself.
Me?
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
Every time I meet somebody, the question is:
Do I know you?
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.
- No, Nicky.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
Do you remember?
- Back up a fuckin' minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally--
Every fuckin' wise guy still around will take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fuckin' warned.
Don't go over my head again, you motherfucker, you!
- Well, we got company.
- Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he's actin' like he don't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
- To Abraham Lincoln.
- Don't let it bother you.
- Does it look like it's botherin' me?
Why do I give a fuck?
That prick.
He won't even look over.
What's his fuckin' problem?
- Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're havin' a good time.
- So are we.
- Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.
- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
- He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000.
I said 50!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take but don't give back.
How the fuck can you grin?
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
You give a fuck?
Do you?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fuckin' mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
Sherbert send you to rob me now?
Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick all night?
Been beating the customers?
Huh, jag-off?
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
That's it.
Keep lookin' at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep lookin' at him for?
You fuckin'-
- Look at this, 20 fuckin' paints in a row.
Hit me again.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
Give me the fuckin' money.
- I'm gonna okay you ten.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
Ten and that's it.
What are you starin' at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on, come on.
Let's get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin'.
Deal.
Everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 11:00 in the morning 'til 1:00 in the afternoon.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Comin' right back to me...
- or finding' some other excuse to come--
- We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things, and I could leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look-Look in my eyes.
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life... a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
- Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.
- Beverly Hotel.
- Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.
My daughter is with them, and I think they're gonna try and kidnap her.
- Is there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.
We got a number and an address.
- Hello.
Is this Lester?
- Hello.
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
- I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn't.
- You shouldn't do this.
- You understand?
Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
So...
Iisten-- Can I call you back?
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.
- Okay, I'll call you right back.
- Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
You want to get back at this prick?
Hmm?
- Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?
Hey, you got a minute?
He's got two million in the box, am I right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.
Huh?
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man."
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
You're the mother.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth.
You know where she gets this?
- You shut up.
You want me to come over there?
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
- Lester, he called you here.
He called you right here.
- That's who was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here, probably right now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.
What do you think we're gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
- This is fuckin' bullshit!
This is bullshit!
- Get your bag!
Let's go!
- Oh, what bullshit?
What?
You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin'?
- Go, go!
Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
I think he's gonna kill me.
- Just relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'm gonna call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you're gonna be there, right?
- I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay?
You all right?
Okay.
Bye.
- Just knock it off.
You two knock it off.
- She started it.
- She started the whole thing.
I'm just standing here.
- Get in the car.
You're not gonna drive.
Don't even think you're gonna drive.
I'm gonna drive.
- I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
And I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we--
- Ginger called me.
- Yeah.
- I just told you she called me.
- What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
- She's with that cocksucker.
They got Amy.
- That's why I'm here.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
- They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
- I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
I mean, this is family.
It ain't business.
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
You know what I mean?
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
- Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
- Driving me fuckin' crazy.
- I think if you, uh... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fuckin' crazy.
Once you get her here, you think about it.
Wait 'til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
Huh?
- Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane, any plane, to get her here right away.
- That's all I'm asking.
- Do you--
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is--
Do you think if I came back--
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where's the box?
- I gotta tell ya...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
- What's it under?
- Pretty serious.
- How serious?
- It's under 25.
- It's under 25,000?
- Yeah.
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his 25.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch too.
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Good evening, signora.
This way.
- Geno.
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear thousand-dollar suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice--
He doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.
at the most, which is impossible, for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, 1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
I've been told before, "We're working it out."
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?
So, counting the watch, let's say another 4,000... for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're lookin' at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed, huh?
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fuckin' actress.
You can fuckin' get that pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you would have ran away, he would have been fuckin' dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
¶ Dreamin' dreams of you Little babe ¶¶
No, it isn't right.
It isn't fair.
Yes.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fuckin' deal?
I go-
- Listen, I just can't fuckin' take it.
Why should I fuckin' take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fuckin' past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
Yes, I want him killed.
I've fuckin' had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
- Hello.
- Yes, I do!
I fuckin' hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
- Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fuckin' guts!
- You hate my guts?
- I'm sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!
- Come with me now.
Come with me now.
- I want you out.
I want you out of here.
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
- You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.
I need some cash right now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
- You're lower than a dog!
- Fuck you!
Here!
Here!
ls this enough money?
Will it last you two fuckin' days?
Take it!
- Greedy bitch.
Take the fuckin' money.
- I'm going to the bank...
- and I'm getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a.m.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
Fine!
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not taking Amy.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
- I am not!
She's my daughter too!
- Get out of here!
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fuckin'-damn you!
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!
Fucker!
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
And later, I realized I didn't want to give her the money... because if I did, I knew I'd never see her again.
- Oh.
Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, angel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it.
It's none of my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
- I was just--
- What?
What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don't--
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewelry out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust, you know?
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there too.
He's so fuckin' lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
- Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
- No, he wouldn't.
- I would have.
- He'd have been right too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
- You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
- I didn't.
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
- You did.
You're right.
You did.
I like that.
- Exactly what you said.
- That's what I like about you.
You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
- Changed.
- Changed.
- He did.
He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on.
You're a toughie.
You can take this.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help.
I do.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
- I'll take care of you.
Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Thank you.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
- It's what you want?
- That's Ace's wife.
- Fantastic.
- This is great for the boss
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You didn't answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do this thing.
I know that you want me to, but it's just--
I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.
I got your cigarettes.
Oscar wants you to call him.
- So who'd you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.
- Where'd you go?
- To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
- Okay.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
I knew she fucked around.
She did what she did, and I did what I had to do... but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
What?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up gettin' killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up gettin' killed too.
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
- He's good.
He's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.
One night he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would have decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix--
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
- Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!
The cops shot Blue...
- because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
- What do you want?
It's pitch black.
- Pitch black!
- It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin' moron!
- I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!
To get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and they started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...
- Shit, he's covering up again.
- because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out from a teller who owed him money.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah?
What'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothin'.
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
Nah, you would have heard something.
- What's to stop him?
- I know, I know.
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a fuckin' war or something.
I'm not sure yet, but you know what I want you to do?
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?
That ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do?
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let them show you where it's at.
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
- They'll do it.
- When I'm ready, I'll say the word.
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.
Just let me know.
But you got to be ready.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
There or in the fuckin' bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.
- Be right back.
I'll be right back.
- Rudy.
Any calls for me, just give them to Mr. Sherbert.
I'll be right back.
- Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
- I'm going home for a few seconds.
- He's on his way home.
- Oh... okay
- Hello?
- Hello?
Ginger?
- Help, Daddy!
- Amy!
- Amy, open the door!
- I can't!
I'm tied!
- Dad!
- What happened?
- Who did this to you?
- Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey.
- No, please, please!
- Okay, Papa will be right back.
- When did this happen, honey?
- I don't know.
What time did your mother do this?
When did she leave?
I don't know.
- Hello?
- Sammy.
- Yeah.
Who's this?
Nick?
- Me.
- Yeah.
You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I gotta find her.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
She's there with you?
- Yeah, she's here.
- I'll be right over.
Uh, all right.
- Comin' over.
- Great.
Ace, listen, don't make a scene, all right?
- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn't know who to turn to.
She didn't know where to turn.
She's trying to save your marriage.
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
- Hey.
Be fuckin' nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
- Hi, Sam.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It was just for a little while, Sam.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed.
You fuckin' do that again, I'll--
- I was just gonna be out for a little while.
- I should have--
- She was asleep.
I was gonna be right back...
- Listen.
- before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Listen to me.
- Fuck you.
I was gonna be back...
- Let me tell you something.
- before she woke up.
- Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again...
I'll fuckin' kill ya, pure and simple.
You hear me?
Pure and fuckin' simple.
- Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
- I'll fuckin' kill you.
- You fuckin' whore.
- I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
- You want your jewelry?
- I want you to let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig?
Let you disgrace me?
Get up and be a mother.
Get in the car and go to the house right now.
Get up and get in the-- Get-
- Get up.
Get up!
- Get up.
Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- I wouldn't do that--
- Get up!
- I wouldn't do that--
- Get the fuck-
- Are you threatening me?
I'll fuckin' kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.
- I'm going!
I'm going!
- You--
- Now you need approval from him to go home?
- So what?
So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in?
- Huh?
- You make me sick, you fuckin'--
- Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
- Oh, fuck you!
- Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
Fuck you!
- Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please.
- Who's this?
- Billy, listen, I'll explain later.
- You got a gun at home?
Bring it over right away.
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.
I'll do it.
- Okay.
- Leave it where it is!
Where is he?
Goddamn it, I want that Jew bastard killed!
Calm down.
Shh.
Hide her car in the back.
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
What did I tell you?
Supposin' he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me what you said.
- Me?
I said nothing.
I said, "No, no, no." Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."
If it's so fucking dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?
Motherfucker.
- I knew this.
I knew it.
- What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?
You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money?
Are you out of your mind?
- Look what you did to this fuckin' guy?
- What?
If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut.
What the fuck is the use!
I should've never got involved--
- Hey!
Hey!
You motherfucker, you!
Ow!
You fuck!
You fucker!
Get out!
Get the fuck out!
- Get out!
Get the fuck out!
- No!
No!
- Get down there!
Take it easy!
I should never have gotten involved with this fucking nut!
You'll fuckin' kill her.
Take it easy.
- Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
- All right.
- I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I'm not scared anymore!
- All right.
Be careful.
- You've fucked with me for the last time!
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Be careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
- Can you believe that?
- Look at this motherfucker.
- Whew.
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fuckin' broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.
You know that?
A bad fuckin' spot.
I'd already left the kid with neighbors... and I had about a million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put it in the hotel safe, then I want you to come right back.
- She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's--
- Wait there for me.
Get out here and talk to me!
You fuckin' ignore me, you motherfucker!
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it!
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
I'm going to drive your fucking car through the living room!
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
- Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
- Will you stop it?
- You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
- I am not!
- You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.
- Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
I am!
He's my new sponsor!
- How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Hey.
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore!
I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I will go to the police!
- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein-
- Shh.
- He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry.
We've been getting some complaints about the noise.
- I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
- I understand.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.
- I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?
- Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get a few of my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
How about if we just let her in the house to get a few things?
- This is half her house anyway.
- I'm afraid to let her in the house.
You aren't afraid, you fucker!
- I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fucker!
Fucker!
Hold on!
Hey!
Please!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
- It'll make it easier--
- If we let her get her things...
- we'll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house--
- I am calm!
- If she calms down...
I will let her in the house for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens to not want to leave.
- Can I go in?
Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to me.
He's locked up most of my important stuff.
All my papers and things-- I have to get them.
So don't let him come up here.
I know they're in here in the desk-
- Fuck.
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.
Are you watching for him?
Got 'em.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it'll just be a couple-- We got other things to do too.
I'll hurry her up.
- How's everything else besides this?
- Fine.
Fine.
- How's your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
- Oh, good.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
We're kind of happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing and then we can go.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shit!
God!
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.
And it would be great... if you guys could just follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
I just need to pick up a little cash inside.
Could you come with me?
- Charlie, you've got to stop her.
You've got to stop her.
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What can I do?
- She's a fuckin' junkie.
She's out of her fucking mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
- Oh!
- There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Half-
- I'm coming down.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag.
If you could just ask the guy for the big bag.
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.
- Lady, I can't take it.
- No, you can, you can.
You've been so nice to me.
- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can--
Oh, God, it's him.
You have to stop him.
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.
Mr. Roth-
- Mr. Roth-- Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
- Hold on a second.
Hey.
- She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
- There's nothing we can do.
She had the keys.
- She's on the account.
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
- We're placing you under arrest for--
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting--
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting--
- But I'm just trying to leave.
After all the threats and all the bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
- But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
- But it was mine.
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn't do anything.
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.!
We have a warrant!
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license--
- Paradise.
We managed to really fuck it all up.
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.
F.B.I. We have a federal search warrant.
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- My name is Mark Casper.
Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?
- Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.
You can make a phone call, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
They got almost everybody else.
- This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.
Put every box on the table.
Ah, yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
Green?
Don't even ask.
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn't.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'm willing to tell you whatever you want to know.
- I've got nothing to hide here.
- Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
- Oh, this is good.
Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Look at this.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.
What a fuckin' balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?
- Take it easy.
- Wait!
- Wait a minute!
He's sick!
Oh, God!
- Move back.
- I think it's his heart!
Oh, God!
ls he breathing?
- C.P.R. now!
Poor Artie.
He got so upset, he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- Artie!
No, I won't calm down!
- He's my husband!
Artie!
Artie!
- We can't help him if--
And at the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that?
But I didn't want to look at them.
I didn't want to look at the guys who brought them either.
Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
When the bosses were arrested, some of them were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set.
- We're going to take a recess.
- When it looked like they could get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming' a casino... sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the courthouse.
See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fuckin' Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
Remo, what do you think?
Look... why take a chance?
At least, that's the way I feel about it.
Call Artie.
Tell him, I don't care what...
- he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with that guy--
As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
- He thought nobody would find him there.
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So, naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you goin', jag-off?
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
- Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked.
Oh, no!
No!
No!
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels.
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was 3,600 in mint condition coins.
No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
- Hey, Nicky.
And so did the powers that be.
- How are you?
- How you doin'?
It took months for everything to calm down.
But, finally, my guys got out on bail... and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin' dollars.
I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
I mean, what's right is right.
- They don't give a fuck about--
Holy fuckin'!
What the fuck--
Come on, motherfucker!
- Tough guys!
You and your fuckin' brother!
- You fuckin' scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
- Frankie!
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker!
Piece of shit!
No, no, no, no!
Take this motherfucker out!
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
All right.
Strip him.
No balls.
You got no fuckin' balls.
Ah, Dominick.
Ah, Dom.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Oh, Dominick.
Come on, come on.
- Bury them?
- Bury them.
- The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
- They buried them while they were still breathing.
Mister, you all right?
Watch out!
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.
They had other ideas for me.
We need some help over here!
- You sure are lucky, mister.
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
And while the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checkin' into an airport.
And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the Pyramids?
Junk bonds.
Still not sure?
- Probable.
Maybe questionable.
Let me know as soon as you can find out.
But in the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that.
When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.
There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.
Otherwise, what's the point?
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.
Before I ever ran a casino, or got myself blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I could change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I'm serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money... $62,700,000.
I don't know all the details.
Nobody knew all the details, but it should've been perfect.
I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had, Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should've been so sweet too.
But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again.
At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you're talking about a half hour or 45 minutes of digging'.
And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fuckin' night.
Who could resist?
Anywhere else in the country I was a bookie, a gambler... always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and I went to work.
...the casino manager.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It's like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comp trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.
That's the truth about Las Vegas.
We're the only winners.
The players don't stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the holy of holies, the count room.
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.
Even I couldn't get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.
They had so much fuckin' money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.
And the best part was that upstairs...
- the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.
I mean, to them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify 5,000.
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.
Were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standin' in front of about two million dollars... to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise...
- the IRS or anybody.
- Verify 200.
Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way.
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra C-note a week... just to watch the door.
It's routine.
Business as usual:
In, out, hello, good-bye.
And that's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walking' out of the casino with a suitcase.
Now that suitcase was goin' straight to one place:
Right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without gettin' themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all... the bosses ever wanted.
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
- Somethin' smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.
The bosses would come from all over the place:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest.
And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City.
I mean, nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking'.
- Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?
Now, these old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly control Las Vegas.
Mama, that man's here again.
Because they control the Teamsters Union.
And that's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.
- Would you put in shrimp?
- I would.
Here you are, gentlemen.
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
- Definitely the most important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.
- That's around 700,000.
- Uh-huh, good.
I know it's a little early for Las Vegas...
But I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry.
As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.
He even played golf with the president.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.
And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... this check for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
He did what he was told.
Now, here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.
He didn't want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money.
He wanted to believe the Teamsters... gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart.
I know full well how much competition we have in this great city.
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money... to come and pick up his own fuckin' check.
And of course it was the bosses' man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the chairman of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.
I understand.
I understand.
Now all they needed was... somebody they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fuckin' place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot at runnin' a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to.
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.
I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The state law says that you can work in a casino... while they're processing your application.
They got a ten-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out?
We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?
They'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
They take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys been workin' there for 30 years, don't have a license.
It's a tough proposition, Andy.
You know if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious, no interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
And that's how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15 years old, and he always made money.
But he didn't bet like you or me.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly.
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.
He had to know everything, this guy.
He'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew... and that's what he'd put his money on.
Even back home, years ago... when we were first hanging' out... he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...
I'll take Columbia for 20.
- If his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the different bounce... you got off the different kinds of wood they used... on college basketball courts, you know?
He'd be workin' on this shit day and night.
There was nothing about a game he was gonna bet that he didn't know.
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that's just the way he was.
But back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck... about whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost...
Cazzo!
All those fuckin' sweeps.
- Unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
I mean, fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fuckin' zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fuckin' Remo everything.
And to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
- Hey!
- Keepin' Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi...
How the hell'd you do it?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
You see?
Never tells me nothin'.
What do we got on for next week?
Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.
Is that all right?
- Okay, you'll come by the house?
- I'll come by.
7:00.
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up?
Okay, Ace?
Hey, Nick.
Vien acca.
- I'll be right out.
- T'aggia parla.
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He's makin' a lot of money for us.
And he's gonna continue making' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there that... without brains.
- Okay?
- All right.
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah.
Want me to take this for you?
So now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around with the golden Jew.
Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.
Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
- They all made money with us.
- They paying'?
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week, like they're supposed to.
- Don't ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don't see any money.
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.
Who's this guy?
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine.
I laid nine.
- It was eight.
Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.
- Eight.
- If he don't know, nobody knows.
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?
'Cause you're a jag-off.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Is this yours?
Your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen.
Why?
No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.
I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen... and shove it up your ass, you fuckin' jag-off.
- Well, I was just offering you the...
- This fuckin' assho...
Look out, Joe.
Look out.
What's that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little fuckin' girl?
What happened to the fuckin' tough guy...
- told my friend to stick it up his fuckin' ass?
Nicky, take it easy.
Nicky, Nicky.
While I was trying to figure out why the guy was saying... what he was saying, Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him... because he'll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
Listen, with me protecting' Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
I mean, that's what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.
# I got $700 #
# Don't you mess with me #
# But you know I'm down #
# Everybody knows I'm down ##
In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the, you know, good old boys.
I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shoveling mule shit.
Ward, you've got to keep a cleaner space.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him, all right?
Won't happen again, Sam.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein.
Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
What's the story?
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
Thank you very much, Senator.
- They passed the laws, they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room.
- I had dozens of politicians and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.
Coming through that place every week.
- Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.
Why not make him happy?
...the Presidential Suite.
For politicians like our State Senator up there, everything was on the house.
These guys won their comp life when they got elected... so, hey, why not take advantage of it.
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It's a whale like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat... that's the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.
Downstairs he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and two million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.
I can't understand it.
These mechanical things, you know they happen.
Hey, but better here than up there, you know what I mean.
Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan.
I can't believe that there's a convention; there's no room.
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
- I'm sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet 1,000 a hand, instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.
...to the bank with a natural lead over a five.
But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa... was that they can't bet small for long.
He didn't think of it as winning 10,000... he thought of it as losing 90,000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all.
# Goddamn it Trying to make it real #
# Compared to what #
# Sock it to me #
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.
Six.
All right, who's gonna give me that?
Since the players are looking to beat the casino...
Each and every roll, all right.
- The dealers are watching the players...
- Six.
- Fake a six.
- The boxmen are watching the dealers.
The floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I'm watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys up there... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
# Tryin' to make it real compared to what #
Yes!
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.
Lookin' good.
Lookin' good.
Let's go.
This is for Ginger.
Come on.
Let me have a hundred on your hard ten.
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice...
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You were great.
Thanks.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
- Come on.
- What's the matter?
What do you mean?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I've seen you stealing from me.
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.
- I want my half.
- I've been watching you all night.
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Get lost!
Get lost?
Get lost?
Yes!
Yes!
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!
# Slippin' and a-slidin' # Changin' and a-hidin' #
# Been told a long time ago #
# I been told Baby, you've been born #
# I won't be your fool no more Oww #
# Baby, oh, baby #
# My sweet baby #
# You're the one #
What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
# What's different about him #
# I don't really know #
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
# No matter how I try #
# I just can't make him cry #
- Ginger's mission in life was money.
- I'll be right back.
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers... and helped them spread around a lot of money.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?
- And you do.
Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
# You only make me glad #
# Better listen, little girl #
# You're goin' walkin' down the street #
# I ain't got no love #
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
# This heart of stone #
- How you doin' tonight?
- Good.
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.
- Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.
And that's what Vegas is all about.
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.
- It's kickback city.
- Have a good night.
Thank you.
You too.
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.
Pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, she took care of the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... because they took care of the security guards...
- who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.
- No problem.
- You are a doll.
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.
But one thing I just could never understand... was that she could have everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Gin, you know I got other people in this, they got partners.
I want you to understand that I am looking out for you... in this thing, okay?
You're gonna get yours back, and you're gonna get back first, okay?
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?
Where are you?
You're in that place.
Where are you?
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
- You're my woman.
- I know.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag.
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.
And somehow she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
If you find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well.
- That's why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.
- Back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.
- Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.
# Volare #
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops.
This time they wanted to pinch him...
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.
- Hold it, hold it.
Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
- And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.
Look at this.
Beautiful!
I mean, that's what worried me. 'Cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
- All right, we're clear.
- There's more.
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What's that?
Huh, what's that?
There's no more.
Thanks, hon.
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn't send me out there to have a good time.
They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?
Hey, Sammy.
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- Incredible.
Welcome to Vegas.
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What've you been doing out here?
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick, they're dear friends of mine.
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you... it's no joke out here, it's no joke.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It's not like back home.
Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us.
And this sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care.
I wanna get away from back home for a while.
I'm tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place, everything's legit.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Ace saw Vegas one way...
- You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
- Of course.
But I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
I mean, they had bookies, pimps... and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started gettin' everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
Yeah, he had a foolproof scheme, all right.
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected;
when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves.
What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin'?
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?
Oh, Nicky.
I thought you was layin'.
No, no, I'm takin'.
I was takin'.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window... you'll get unconfused.
- Gimme the fuckin' money.
- I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't mean anything by it.
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?
- My fuckin' head.
- Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president.
George Washington was born...
But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town... like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
Beautiful, you got a beautiful swing.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved in Little League.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches... was a fuckin' metro intelligence cop.
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.
He's gotta realize that everything can't be a home run that he does.
That's exactly what I keep tellin' him... but that's the kind of kid he is.
And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.
They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fuckin' balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of 200 fuckin' grand...
- yeah, right, I'm sure.
- Hey!
How are you?
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm over here now.
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase and then he left.
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's out?
I think maybe he went across the street... or somewhere else or somethin'.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- Yeah, lots of luck.
- Yeah, good luck to you too.
- Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.
Yeah, they don't need those anymore.
Guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
'Cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble.
Even after we'd catch them, they'd try sneaking back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy, he's betting' lavender chips... at 500 each with only one little problem... he's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they're all greedy.
# I got a feelin' about the future #
# And it ain't too good I know that #
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.
He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Now, here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card... and signaling his buddy at this table.
And that's just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away.
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Jeff #
# Happy birthday to you #
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
They never know what hit them.
And if and when they do find out... that they just got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals... they were knocking this place dead for years.
- He's got a wire on him.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There it is.
That's it.
- Cheater's justice.
- Oh, God!
No, no, no!
I wanted everybody to know... that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks... that the party was over.
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks... with your right hand.
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.
- You can't do it with both hands?
- No, sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I never tried.
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
- It's 100, 110, I think.
- Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hiya.
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don't I take him... over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
And by the way... send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
- Sure will.
- Real special.
- By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
- Hi.
- Having a good time?
- Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice:
You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here.
- What do you want?
- I just wanna get out of here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake.
'Cause if you come back here, and we catch either one of you... we're gonna break your heads, and you won't walk out of here.
You see that fuckin' saw?
We're gonna use it.
You got it?
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.
Throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car.
Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters... the per was way up, the gods were happy.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We're not gettin' any younger.
Don't you think it's time?
Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I'm gonna do you one better.
I'm tryin' to marry you.
You wanna marry me?
I'm serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you.
And I can't think of anybody better to be with.
And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam?
'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, okay.
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.
- All right, all right.
- Understand?
Sam, I'm sorry.
No, I...
I...
I mean...
I can grow.
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.
What is love anyway?
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.
It's a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out, doesn't play out... then what happens to me?
You know I'm doing well now, and I'm gonna do even better.
And so whatever happens... if it doesn't work out between us...
I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.
And if there are kids, especially...
I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What are you pitching me?
Just what I said, you'll be set up... for the rest of your life, that I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories.
But I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town, and he knew they'd show.
Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride, even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby before they could get married.
He even made Jenny and me watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
But I didn't mind, we loved the kid.
Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don't make me come there.
Answer me.
I love you.
But, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
You do?
Yeah, I do.
It's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right, in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.
I'm lookin' at you right now.
I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute.
I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
I'm okay, I just...
You just have to understand.
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
I just...
I don't...
I think I have a right to do that.
Okay?
It's all right.
That part of your life is over with.
- Right?
- Yeah.
You're with me now.
- Yeah.
- Right?
Uh-huh.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Let's go.
Let's go back in.
- Okay.
Oh!
Tsk.
It's great.
It's great.
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can't...
Try it on.
It's yours.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
Nice, isn't it?
No one's ever been so nice to me.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
So, do you think it's too much... if I wear these all on the same day?
You do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
So wonderful.
The jewelry's not so bad either.
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
- What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
- Okay.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this doesn't mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
With over a million in cash and jewels... tucked in a bank in Vegas, only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
So I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank... under the name of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
And since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet... when I needed the money the most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
- # I'll take you there # - # I'm callin', callin' #
# Callin' for mercy #
- # I'll take you there # - # Mercy, mercy #
# I'll take you there #
This is a signature card.
So once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Yeah, sure I do.
Why?
It's good.
It's just unusual.
Tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
- # Let me take you there # - # I'll take you there #
- # Ain't no smiling' faces # - # I'll take you there ##
# Never will I know happiness #
With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
And to play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a license.
I mean Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming his own kind of Vegas.
I put money out on the street charging' three points a week.
- Don't make us come lookin' for you.
- Juice to the fuckin' dealers.
You won't have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
It was so obvious.
- All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics were signal-happy.
- I'm gonna open for 500.
Signaling back and forth.
Why you cryin' with two loaves of bread under your arm?
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.
I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky's a made guy, and I'm not.
I can't do that.
Be careful.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
So I'm lucky.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.
Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place.
A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin' ear...
"This is Las Vegas.
We're supposed to be out here robbin'... you dumb fuckin' hebe. "
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.
Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table.
What's he think this is, a goddamned sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table?
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Call security.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
Wanna do me a favor?
Take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on.
Fuck you!
I want you to exit this guy off the premises... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain't goin' anywhere with you.
- Bullshit.
You're outta here.
- Fuck you!
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Leave me alone!
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?
- Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
Come here.
Come here.
You go over there.
You apologize.
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get outta line again, I'll smash your head so hard... you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fuckin' hick.
Sammy, listen.
This guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.
I mean, he's already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...
I swear he'll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he's out for good.
I don't care what it is, I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this, really.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kickin', stinky-horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in the desert.
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I'm sorry.
# You're dear to me Yes, sirree #
You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David and their tigers away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a Rolls-Royce.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fuckin' angles.
He brought over the whole "Femme Fatale" show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like balloons.
She's still eight pounds over.
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.
Never mind the "sir. " Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them...
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I guess she's frightened.
If she doesn't lose weight she may get fired.
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris...
- It's been our policy...
- Just stop everything!
- This woman's an institution.
- That's the problem.
She's lazy.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So, he took bookie joints off the street... and then opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years by doing all of this... he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off of him.
Between my innovations...
# Look like they're taking some cat to jail # and Nicky's dedication to his job...
# Steamboats are comin' and they're splashing and goin' #
I soon had the best operation on the strip.
# Moon is shinin' on friends below #
You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why?
Somebody's complaining'?
I'm hearing things from security.
The sheriff's lookin' to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
They got two names from the whole country... and one of 'em is still Al Capone.
If they put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.
You will not be able to walk into a casino.
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.
I'm just tellin' you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
All right.
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
Back home, they would've put me in jail for what I'm doing.
But out here, they're giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... for charitable donations to greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife, Ginger, work the room.
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.
We'd love to have you there.
- Yes, okay.
- Great.
She made everybody feel good.
# That's Stella by starlight #
Congratulations, Sam.
Oh, thanks.
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
- Hi.
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fuckin' kid!
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!
They didn't know what really moved her.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Daddy gave me this...
And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin' back there?
You can't even see 'em there.
- Okay, I'll...
- What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
- Well...
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.
- The action is in the front.
Bring 'em up front.
- All right, I will.
Listen to me very carefully.
There are three ways of doing things around here:
The right way, the wrong way and the way that I do it.
- You understand?
- I do understand that.
I'll get right on it.
- And thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Just do it.
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right, Mr. Rothstein.
I am so sorry.
So I ended up working...
what, 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get something out of it.
Well, it wasn't long... before what I was afraid was gonna happen happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas.
And from then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"He will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000... every time he shows up. "
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it.
You got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation... "
Motherfucker!
Is there any way around this?
No, there's no way.
Let's say, for instance...
I wanna go in a restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can't even set foot in the parking lot.
That's how serious it is.
In other words, I'm fucked?
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.
I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.
They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
So, once they pulled that shit...
I started doin' my own things nobody ever thought of doin'.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados... and started knocking' over high-rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers...
anybody right here in town.
I had a good fuckin' crew goin' for me, I'll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy.
He worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
And I opened up my own jewelry store too, the "Gold Rush. "
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.
But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off looking at me... so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
- What's takin' so long?
- This is a motherfucker!
- It's working.
- Learn how to open these things so you don't have to take 'em.
Some of these stones got a lot of niggers in them.
Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he better take a camel back to Nigeria.
Yeah?
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
- All right.
Thanks.
He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen.
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.
- Valet parkers.
- They're just checking in now.
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.
- 1230.
Right.
- Secretaries.
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition?
All right.
And they all got a piece of the score.
Car's coming.
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else... if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
What the fuck they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?
You know, this diamond has flaws in it.
- There's no flaws.
- I'm doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws.
Whenever we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
What, are you gonna have a fucking meeting here?
I know his language.
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.
Twenty thousand.
That's my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk Turkey here.
Twenty-five thousand.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault... where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush... in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.
She used to fall asleep on the couch watching TV.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't even supposed to be doin' it.
The bosses were making so much fucking money with the casinos... that they didn't want anybody making' any waves for them.
You gave all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?
That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came here.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet?
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.
You will try to push it through, won't you, Mr. Clark?
- Yes.
- I'm giving you 50,000 cash.
Then I put some more money into legitimate places, like my restaurant.
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Fuckers.
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.
Enjoy.
Have a good time.
Choke on it, motherfucker.
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin'?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with it.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over the place.
That show over at the Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said, whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls, naturally.
I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star.
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.
- Hey, Shelly.
How are you?
- Hi.
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.
- This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
Come on.
I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days.
It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?
You know you're a lyin' lowlife, motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
Your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off.
And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money?
- No?
You didn't?
- I didn't...
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck outta me.
You wanna embarrass me and make a fool outta me?
You didn't gamble?
Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money...
I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on!
Did you gamble?
Huh?
Fuckin' degenerate.
Fuckin' kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck outta here.
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.
Let me find out you fucked up.
I'll leave you where I find you.
How many of these you gonna eat?
- Two.
- Two?
But around 6:30 in the morning, when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?
- Not a lot.
You know why, right?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- 'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.
Every couple of weeks, I used to send Marino... back to the bosses with a piece of what I made.
Not a bit piece, but what did they know?
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do...
I would carry things out to a "T."
Like the time Tony Dogs, who's supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo's bars.
Here's a fuckin' guy kills two of Remo's guys... and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just workin' on her night off, of all things.
I mean, this guy's just beggin' to be made an example of.
Frankie, I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
And I don't care what you have to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?
- I'll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow 'em down.
To be truthful with you, I had to admire this guy.
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.
This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two fuckin' nights we beat the shit outta this guy.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
- Better give me a name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.
- But he never talked.
- I know you would've ratted by now.
In the end, I had to put his fuckin' head in a vise.
Dogs, Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.
I'll squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.
Don't make me have to do this.
Please.
Come on!
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Come on.
Fuck you!
This motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fuckin' days and nights.
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're tellin' me?
You motherfucker, you!
Huh?
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M.
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.
You make me pop your fuckin' eye outta your head... to protect that piece of shit, Charlie M.?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!
You motherfucker, you!
Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
The word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
Charlie M.
Four reels, sevens, across three $15,000 jackpots.
Do you have any idea what the odds are?
It's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn't you call me?
It happened so quick.
Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.
- You didn't see the scam?
- There's no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
They won!
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.
What's the matter with you?
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
I think you're overreacting.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel.
I've been carrying your ass ever since I got here.
- Get your ass outta here.
- You're firing me?
I'm firing you.
No, I'm not firing...
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.
This is not the way to treat people.
If you didn't know, you're too fuckin' dumb.
If you did know, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.
Get out.
Come on.
Let's go.
The guy's history as far as I'm concerned.
But you can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a commissioner.
This is his state.
His uncle's chief judge.
His brother-in-law runs the county commission.
You're in the finances, you're upstairs.
But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.
I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.
There is not one single thing I will not catch.
- Look at yours.
Look at that.
- Huh?
Look at this.
There's nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
What are you talking about?
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
- Where are you going?
- # How long can this go on #
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that's going to take?
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
- What do you need?
- Got her?
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don't you take it out of your account?
I would, you know, Sam, it's just that...
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?
What's the difference?
I just need it.
Well, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.
You're not asking for a box of popcorn.
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.
Okay?
We don't have to have a fight.
It's important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.
Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.
Why can't you tell me what it's for?
Huh?
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for 25,000.
What do you want, a coat?
- No.
- If you want a coat, you got it.
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
Sam, I've been independent my whole life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
- Now you're making me beg.
- What are you talking about?
And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?
You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
You know, it's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
Can I trust you?
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you could tell me what the money is for.
# You've got to #
# Give a little #
# Take a little #
# And let your poor heart #
# Break a little #
Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.
All right, I'm gonna follow her.
What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
It means I got the money.
# You've got to #
- # Give a little #
- Yes, you're way up on top now.
# Take a little ##
How are you doin', Les?
It's Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
If I'm wrong, please correct me.
'Cause I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine too.
Go ahead.
Take it.
'Cause you already have hers.
She's my wife.
Look at me.
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew that she's my wife?
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah, I know that.
You know, yeah?
But if you ever come back again, ever... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man.
Don't be a fucking pimp.
Now, you wanna do me a favor?
Get outta here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get up and get outta here.
- And you want to be free.
- # Take a little #
Why, you feel that you are too good... much too good for a nobody like me.
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- That's fuckin' bullshit.
- # That's the story #
- Well, darling, I guess it's best...
- # That's the glory of love # - that we should part.
Remember when you called him that night and said good-bye?
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down. "
- He didn't say that to you, did he?
- No, he didn't.
No.
Instead, what did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got. "
Come here.
I want to show you something.
- # That's the story #
- The second letter came right after I gave you your start.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Make 'em stop it!
No!
No!
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!
No!
- Fuck!
Fuck!
- Piece of shit.
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He's such a prick!
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn't want to do it himself.
Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands dirty.
So why did he have to do that, huh?
Tell me.
- I know it wasn't a nice thing to do...
- No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down...
No.
No.
I told him all about this guy before we ever got married.
- This is no fucking surprise.
- Oh, you did?
I didn't know that.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
You know, the first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open, you know.
I knew the bottom could drop out at any time.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this... if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?
So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.
You mean like a lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I'm just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?
A million dollars in jewelry.
Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you?
I should've never married him.
He's a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.
I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
You know, this is probably not...
I don't have the answers anyway.
- This is probably not what you want to hear...
- I do.
'Cause you're a little upset, and I understand that.
But I think you should try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could've killed him!
Okay?
He could've killed him.
He didn't have to hit him.
It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What is that all about?
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl.
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this.
You're so nice.
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.
- # These eyes before us #
- Thanks.
# Just what the truth is #
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
# I can't say anymore #
# 'Cause I love you #
# Yes, I love you... ##
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?
Uh, no.
No, thank you, little lady.
Okay, send him in.
Then call me four minutes after.
- Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
- How do you do?
- Hey, it is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well.
Hey, all that money is rollin' in.
I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor civil servant.
- Why don't you have a seat, hmm?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I come here personally to kind of smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
See, uh, maybe you didn't know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends.
Nice family and their money go back many, many years.
Now friends vote.
Family and money votes.
That's important to me and you.
And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you'll forgive me for sayin' it... maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
That means, either he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was goin' on.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Are, uh...
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.
What you're saying is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be very helpful to that kid.
He's weak.
He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.
There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favor... if you'd think some more on hiring' him back.
I can't do that.
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law... and I do want to help you and I like to do favors.
I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.
He's too incompetent, and the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Okay.
Thanks.
Well... you know, that's it.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests.
But you act like you're at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.
But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the governor.
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- You bet.
What happened to my pills?
Huh?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinking too much?
You're taking my pills too?
I didn't take your pills.
Look, for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these.
And that's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with 'em?
You didn't have to beat him up.
What?
I was just trying to help him.
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring about people.
What?
What?
I said, you can't make me... stop caring about people.
Listen...
Ginger...
I'm trying to make the best of everything here, you know?
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.
I mean, people look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit!
I'm gettin' out of here.
I am.
Come over here.
You gotta get hold of yourself.
- Okay.
Okay.
- If not for me, at least for Amy.
Understand?
Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand.
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.
That's all you care about.
You don't care about me.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that fuckin' leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Okay?
You'll do it.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Okay.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
I will.
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rollin' in... and the suitcases kept comin' and goin'.
And let me tell you, the fuckin' bottom line here is... cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin' a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Huh?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
Even John Nash...
that's the guy who ran the scam... he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the purpose.
Huh?
They take this money because they're my guys, so give 'em some leeway.
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
- What were you doin'?
- I was with my cumma.
- What are you doin' with your cumma?
- I gave her a scheff.
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
- What you been doin'?
- I'm out there more than I'm here.
And little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they'd would've been better off makin' fuckin' novena.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
- I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
- What expenses?
I'm layin' money outta my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping' records.
No records, Artie.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I keep laying' out my own fuckin' dough.
What the hell are we doin' over here?
You're goin' to Las Vegas at my expense.
Oh, fuck.
I mean, after all...
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next.
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- We made a deal.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr. Integrity... had a partner nobody knew about.
And when she showed up and started demanding money...
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're wrong.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.
Green tried to stonewall her.
I will see to it that you do not get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its president, Phil Green.
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
Hey, that's not good.
She was doin' pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start countin' her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
Can you comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
- What are you talking about?
- She was found last night shot in the head.
Was this just a real estate partnership?
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
Did you ever hear of the. 22 Caliber Killer?
Now, instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with real estate deals.
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
Hmm, have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties... says that he is the real boss of the $100 million...
Tangiers casino empire. "
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.
Has that man even filed for his license yet?
I don't know.
We have to check the files.
Without gettin' your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And kinda check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass outta town.
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation... of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein's application... for a gaming license is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino...
Hello?
- I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?
- You can't.
- You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
- No, no.
It's impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.
It's very difficult to get in.
I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.
All right.
The battle between State gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?
- Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Huh?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
At 6:00:
Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
Go down.
Just... go downst-
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry.
It's just a political witch hunt.
Ace.
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.
No.
Hey, Mr. Clark.
I've been tryin' to reach you.
- You're tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
- You know, I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and, uh, if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail... hopefully you'll be comin' out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fuckin' head open again.
'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat Irish prick!
You put my money to sleep!
- Get my money, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, Fatso.
You fuckin' try me.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'?
He's a square guy, for chrissakes.
He's gonna run to the F.B.I.
That prick's been dodging' me for three weeks.
You're tryin' to tell me what to do.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You're outta line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fuckin' balls?
I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together here.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
If you're actin' like this now, can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that license.
If it goes bad for me, it's bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fuckin' license.
I plant my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.
You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
That's taken out of context.
I had no control over that.
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?
- What happened to you?
You lost control.
- I lost control?
Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fuckin' cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you been treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you her tell about your little role in that situation?
No, that's not the fuckin' point.
- The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
- I would appreciate it... if you stay out of my personal life.
- You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?
- Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
- It's none of my business?
A week ago it was.
Now it's none of my business.
When you need me, you need me.
The way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy is gonna run to the F.B.I. Now.
Your head's bigger than your casino.
I knew what he wanted.
Nicky wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
Plus, he had stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
They questioned Nicky.
When some guys that didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every one of those newspapers.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over, there.
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Come on, be nice, huh?
And the bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealin' with degenerate animals out here.
But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sittin' on their asses drinking' anisette.
I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fuckin' bosses think it's a fuckin' free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
- Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Everybody's talkin'.
They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
And I mean, that's no good.
You gotta tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Fuckin' bosses;
they're smokin' their Di Nobilis... and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin' suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.
If I want to talk private, I gotta go to a bus stop.
- What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?
- They're complaining'.
Let 'em complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
- Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.
- It's up to you.
They want a fuckin' war?
I'm ready.
All I gotta do is take care of five of those guys.
The rest will fall into place.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me too.
The F.B.I. Watched every move he made, but he didn't care.
He just didn't care.
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch 'em right back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I. De-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.
And because of that, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doin' anything.
I got my job on the line, and this guy's havin' the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up, and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.
That's gonna mean something when you go before the commission.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.
All right, well, we'll move on to...
- I wanted to hear something about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this guy gonna land, the fairway?
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the Control Board.
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.
And as if things weren't bad enough, in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they bought the suitcases.
Fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple grand.
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but mostly what he did was complain about his trips to Vegas.
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise they're gonna make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fuckin' nickel goes down.
Receipts...
- Hey, oh, wha...
What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
- Again.
- I said, "frickin' head. "
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
What happens next?
You can't believe it.
Who would believe that the F.B.I. Had a wire in the place... lookin' for some information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked-out God knows when over God knows what.
What's to prevent him with the suitcases that he could take what he wants?
Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
You believe this bullshit?
Sure, he's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together, those fucks.
I'll find out.
If it's Green, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
- I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.
- Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beatin' me left and right.
- Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm all upset.
- I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doin'.
I can't take this no more.
Back and forth.
- Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
- I know.
I'm too upset.
And the damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas and the casinos and suitcases... and that's it.
Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.
Would you believe that such a thing could happen?
I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.
Every F.B.I. Man across the country had their ears open now.
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
I mean, Piscano, this guy basically sunk the whole world.
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired F.B.I. Agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counselor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked...
This commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean, "Adjourned"?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the F.B.I. Reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest?
I never comped you?
- I don't comp you at least three times a month?
- I'd like to answer that.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was with Barney Greenstein.
- Was I at that dinner?
Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.
- Was I at that dinner?
Was I?
- You were wandering.
- You were... in the...
You were in the building.
- I was in the building?
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Did you not?
Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
You son of a...
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...
- What are you runnin' for, Bob?
- Accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
You promised me when you were getting comped at my hotel.
You were asking me for copies of your bill so you could put 'em on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...
- Bullshit!
Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
But you guys think you have the right to pass judgment!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license... yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
Fuckin' hypocrites!
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.
What's he doin'?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
What are we gonna do?
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.
Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new Sports Book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America;
a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
Mr. Sam Rothstein.
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.
We're very happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy, who is... a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
- Keep an eye on him.
- I've got a large family.
- How many kids do you have?
- I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, please.
Please.
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
- Ace, don't do it.
- ##
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jesus.
He's juggling!
Let's not take Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fuckin' mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
We're on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States.
These guys don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
How can I walk away?
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
He pissed 'em off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for awhile.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain't sending' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break... it would give everybody time to maneuver.
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.
I can't do that.
As soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
Great.
You know, I've got to do some shopping.
You want to go?
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
So on routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, I got a sprained fuckin' elbow.
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards down the road.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit.
I saw something.
Something very cute.
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of comin' back alive... from a meetin' with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people behind my back, goin' over my head?
- What people?
- What people?
What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about.
You said I'm bringin' heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of your shit?
You're ordering' me out?
You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?
- Yeah.
Let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass.
It's not yours.
It's my ass.
I don't know whether you know you have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!
And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You understand.
You could have had the food-and-beverage job without goin' on television!
You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
That's right.
You're makin' a spectacle of yourself.
Me?
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
Every time I meet somebody, the question is:
Do I know you?
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.
- No, Nicky.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
Do you remember?
- Back up a fuckin' minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally...
Every fuckin' wise guy still around will take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fuckin' warned.
Don't go over my head again, you motherfucker, you!
# Crack that whip #
- # Give the past the slip #
- Well, we got company.
# Step on a crack #
# Break your mama's back #
# When a problem comes along you must whip it #
# Before the preacher talks too long #
- # You must whip it #
- Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he's actin' like he don't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
To Abraham Lincoln.
- Don't let it bother you.
- Does it look like it's botherin' me?
Why do I give a fuck?
That prick.
He won't even look over.
What's his fuckin' problem?
- Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're havin' a good time.
- So are we.
- # Whip it good ##
Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.
- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
- He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000.
I said 50!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take but don't give back.
# I ain't got a home I got a phone ##
How the fuck can you grin?
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
You give a fuck?
Do you?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fuckin' mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
Sherbert send you to rob me now?
Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick all night?
Been beating the customers?
Huh, jag-off?
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
That's it.
Keep lookin' at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep lookin' at him for?
You fuckin'...
Look at this, 20 fuckin' paints in a row.
Hit me again.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
Give me the fuckin' money.
- I'm gonna okay you ten.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
Ten and that's it.
What are you starin' at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on, come on.
Let's get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin'.
Deal.
Everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 11:00 in the morning 'til 1:00 in the afternoon.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Comin' right back to me...
- or finding' some other excuse to come...
- We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things, and I could leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look-Look in my eyes.
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life... a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
- Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.
- Beverly Hotel.
- Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.
My daughter is with them, and I think they're gonna try and kidnap her.
- Is there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.
We got a number and an address.
- Hello.
Is this Lester?
- Hello.
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
- I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn't.
You shouldn't do this.
- You understand?
Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
So...
listen...
Can I call you back?
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.
- Okay, I'll call you right back.
- Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
You want to get back at this prick?
Hmm?
- Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?
Hey, you got a minute?
He's got two million in the box, am I right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.
Huh?
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man. "
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
You're the mother.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth.
You know where she gets this?
- You shut up.
You want me to come over there?
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
- Lester, he called you here.
He called you right here.
- That's who was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here, probably right now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.
What do you think we're gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
- This is fuckin' bullshit!
This is bullshit!
- Get your bag!
Let's go!
- Oh, what bullshit?
What?
You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin'?
- Go, go!
Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
I think he's gonna kill me.
- Just relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'm gonna call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you're gonna be there, right?
- I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay?
You all right?
Okay.
Bye.
- Just knock it off.
You two knock it off.
- She started it.
- She started the whole thing.
I'm just standing here.
- Get in the car.
You're not gonna drive.
Don't even think you're gonna drive.
I'm gonna drive.
- I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
And I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we...
# You can go your own way #
# Go your own way #
# Tell me why #
- # Everything turned around #
- Ginger called me.
Yeah.
- I just told you she called me.
- What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
- She's with that cocksucker.
They got Amy.
- That's why I'm here.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
- They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
- I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
I mean, this is family.
It ain't business.
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
You know what I mean?
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
- Driving me fuckin' crazy.
- I think if you, uh... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fuckin' crazy.
Once you get her here, you think about it.
Wait 'til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
Huh?
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane, any plane, to get her here right away.
- That's all I'm asking.
- Do you...
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is...
Do you think if I came back...
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where's the box?
- I gotta tell ya...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
- What's it under?
- Pretty serious.
- How serious?
- It's under 25.
- It's under 25,000?
- Yeah.
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his 25.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch too.
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Good evening, signora.
This way.
- Geno.
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear thousand-dollar suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
- # I'm confessin' #
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice...
He doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible, for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, 1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
I've been told before, "We're working it out. "
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?
So, counting the watch, let's say another 4,000... for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're lookin' at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed, huh?
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fuckin' actress.
You can fuckin' get that pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you would have ran away, he would have been fuckin' dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
# Dreamin' dreams of you Little babe ##
No, it isn't right.
It isn't fair.
Yes.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fuckin' deal?
I go...
Listen, I just can't fuckin' take it.
Why should I fuckin' take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fuckin' past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
Yes, I want him killed.
I've fuckin' had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
- Hello.
- Yes, I do!
I fuckin' hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
- Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fuckin' guts!
- You hate my guts?
- I'm sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!
Come with me now.
Come with me now.
- I want you out.
I want you out of here.
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
- You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.
I need some cash right now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
- You're lower than a dog!
- Fuck you!
Here!
Here!
Is this enough money?
Will it last you two fuckin' days?
Take it!
- Greedy bitch.
Take the fuckin' money.
- I'm going to the bank...
- and I'm getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a. m.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
Fine!
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not taking Amy.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
- I am not!
She's my daughter too!
- Get out of here!
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fuckin'- damn you!
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!
Fucker!
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
And later, I realized I didn't want to give her the money... because if I did, I knew I'd never see her again.
- Oh.
Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.
Okay, angel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it.
It's none of my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
- I was just...
- What?
What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewelry out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust, you know?
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there too.
He's so fuckin' lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
- Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
- No, he wouldn't.
I would have.
- He'd have been right too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
- You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
- I didn't.
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
- You did.
You're right.
You did.
I like that.
- Exactly what you said.
- That's what I like about you.
You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.
# And now that it's all over ##
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
- Changed.
- Changed.
- He did.
He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on.
You're a toughie.
You can take this.
- Don't cry.
- I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help.
I do.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
- I'll take care of you.
Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Thank you.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
- It's what you want?
# Yes, it came from your pen, dear, but not from your heart #
- # The third king The joke of the deck #
# You ended your letter enclosed "Please sign my check" #
- That's Ace's wife.
- # Why, you fool #
- # You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool #
- Fantastic.
# If you think that money can pay for the hard years I've suffered #
# 'Til things broke your way #
- This is great for the boss. - # I'm answering your last letter that says we must part #
# I'm tearing up the pieces the way you tore up my heart #
# I smile when you kiss me and I thrill at your touch #
# My only sin was I loved you much too much #
# Win a little #
# Lose a little ##
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You didn't answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do this thing.
I know that you want me to, but it's just...
I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.
I got your cigarettes.
Oscar wants you to call him.
- So who'd you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.
- Where'd you go?
- To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Okay.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
I knew she fucked around.
She did what she did, and I did what I had to do... but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
What?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up gettin' killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up gettin' killed too.
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
- He's good.
He's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.
One night he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would have decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix...
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
- Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!
The cops shot Blue...
- because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
- What do you want?
It's pitch black.
- Pitch black!
- It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin' moron!
- I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!
To get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and they started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...
- Shit, he's covering up again.
- Because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out from a teller who owed him money.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah?
What'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothin'.
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
Nah, you would have heard something.
- What's to stop him?
- I know, I know.
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a fuckin' war or something.
I'm not sure yet, but you know what I want you to do?
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?
That ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do?
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let them show you where it's at.
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
- They'll do it.
- When I'm ready, I'll say the word.
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.
Just let me know.
But you got to be ready.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
There or in the fuckin' bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.

- Yeah.
You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I gotta find her.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
She's there with you?
- Yeah, she's here.
- I'll be right over.
Uh, all right.
- Comin' over.
- Great.
Ace, listen, don't make a scene, all right?
- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn't know who to turn to.
She didn't know where to turn.
She's trying to save your marriage.
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
- Hey.
Be fuckin' nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
# I'll throw off my sorrow ##
- Hi, Sam.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
You tie up our kid and lock the fucking door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It was just for a little while, Sam.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed.
You fuckin' do that again, I'll...
- I was just gonna be out for a little while.
- I should have...
- She was asleep.
I was gonna be right back...
- Listen.
- Before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Listen to me.
- Fuck you.
I was gonna be back...
- Let me tell you something.
- Before she woke up.
- Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
You ever touch her again, you ever do anything like that again...
I'll fuckin' kill ya, pure and simple.
You hear me?
Pure and fuckin' simple.
- Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
- I'll fuckin' kill you.
- You fuckin' whore.
- I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
- You want your jewelry?
- I want you to let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig?
Let you disgrace me?
Get up and be a mother.
Get in the car and go to the house right now.
Get up and get in the...
Get...
Get up.
Get up!

Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Are you threatening me?
I'll fuckin' kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.

- So what?
So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in?

Where is he?
Goddamn it, I want that Jew bastard killed!
Calm down.
Shh.
Hide her car in the back.
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
What did I tell you?
Supposin' he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me what you said.
- Me?
I said nothing.
I said, "No, no, no. " Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful. "
If it's so fucking dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?
Motherfucker.
- I knew this.
I knew it.
- What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?
You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money?
Are you out of your mind?
- Look what you did to this fuckin' guy?
- What?
If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut.
What the fuck is the use!
I should've never got involved...
Hey!
Hey!
You motherfucker, you!
Ow!
You fuck!
You fucker!
Get out!
Get the fuck out!
Get out!
Get the fuck out!
- No!
No!
- Get down there!
Take it easy!
I should never have gotten involved with this fucking nut!
You'll fuckin' kill her.
Take it easy.
- Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
- All right.
- I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I'm not scared anymore!
- All right.
Be careful.
- You've fucked with me for the last time!
Okay.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
- Can you believe that?
- Look at this motherfucker.
Whew.
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fuckin' broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.
You know that?
A bad fuckin' spot.
I'd already left the kid with neighbors... and I had about a million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put it in the hotel safe, then I want you to come right back.
- She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...
- Wait there for me.
Get out here and talk to me!
You fuckin' ignore me, you motherfucker!
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it!
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
I'm going to drive your fucking car through the living room!
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
- Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
- Will you stop it?
- You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
- I am not!
- You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.
- Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
I am!
He's my new sponsor!
How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Hey.
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore!
I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I will go to the police!
- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein...
Shh.
He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry.
We've been getting some complaints about the noise.
- I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
- I understand.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.
- I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?
- Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get a few of my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
How about if we just let her in the house to get a few things?
- This is half her house anyway.
- I'm afraid to let her in the house.
You aren't afraid, you fucker!
- I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fucker!
Fucker!
Hold on!
Hey!
Please!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
- It'll make it easier...
- If we let her get her things...
- we'll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house...
- I am calm!
- If she calms down...
I will let her in the house for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens to not want to leave.
- Can I go in?
Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to me.
He's locked up most of my important stuff.
All my papers and things...
I have to get them.
So don't let him come up here.
I know they're in here in the desk...
Fuck.
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.
Are you watching for him?
Got 'em.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it'll just be a couple...
We got other things to do too.
I'll hurry her up.
- How's everything else besides this?
- Fine.
Fine.
- How's your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
- Oh, good.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
We're kind of happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing and then we can go.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shit!
God!
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.
And it would be great... if you guys could just follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
I can't believe this.
I just need to pick up a little cash inside.
Could you come with me?
- Charlie, you've got to stop her.
You've got to stop her.
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What can I do?
- She's a fuckin' junkie.
She's out of her fucking mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
- Oh!
- There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Legally, she can't take that stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Half...
I'm coming down.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag.
If you could just ask the guy for the big bag.
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.
- Lady, I can't take it.
- No, you can, you can.
You've been so nice to me.
- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can...
Oh, God, it's him.
You have to stop him.
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.
Mr. Roth...
Mr. Roth...
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
Hey.
- She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
- There's nothing we can do.
She had the keys.
- She's on the account.
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
- We're placing you under arrest for...
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- For what?
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- But I'm just trying to leave.
After all the threats and all the bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
- But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
- But it was mine.
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn't do anything.
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.!
We have a warrant!
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...
- Paradise.
We managed to really fuck it all up.
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.
F.B.I. We have a federal search warrant.
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- My name is Mark Casper.
Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?
- Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.
You can make a phone call, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
They got almost everybody else.
- This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.
Put every box on the table.
Ah, yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
Green?
Don't even ask.
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn't.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'm willing to tell you whatever you want to know.
- I've got nothing to hide here.
- Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
- Oh, this is good.
Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Look at this.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.
What a fuckin' balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?
- Take it easy.
- Wait!
- Wait a minute!
He's sick!
Oh, God!
- Move back.
- I think it's his heart!
Oh, God!
Is he breathing?
- C.P.R. Now!
Poor Artie.
He got so upset, he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- Artie!
No, I won't calm down!
- He's my husband!
Artie!
Artie!
- We can't help him if...
And at the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that?
But I didn't want to look at them.
I didn't want to look at the guys who brought them either.
Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
When the bosses were arrested, some of them were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set.
- We're going to take a recess.
- When it looked like they could get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming' a casino... sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the courthouse.
See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fuckin' Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
Remo, what do you think?
Look... why take a chance?
At least, that's the way I feel about it.
Call Artie.
Tell him, I don't care what...
- he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with that guy...
As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
- He thought nobody would find him there.
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So, naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you goin', jag-off?
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked.
Oh, no!
No!
No!
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels.
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was 3,600 in mint condition coins.
No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
- Hey, Nicky.
And so did the powers that be.
- How are you?
- How you doin'?
It took months for everything to calm down.
But, finally, my guys got out on bail... and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin' dollars.
I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
I mean, what's right is right.
They don't give a fuck about...
Holy fuckin'!
What the fuck...
Come on, motherfucker!
- Tough guys!
You and your fuckin' brother!
- You fuckin' scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
- Frankie!
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker!
Piece of shit!
No, no, no, no!
Take this motherfucker out!
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
All right.
Strip him.
No balls.
You got no fuckin' balls.
Ah, Dominick.
Ah, Dom.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Dominick.
Oh, Dominick.
Come on, come on.
- Bury them?
- Bury them.
The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
- They buried them while they were still breathing.
Mister, you all right?
Watch out!
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.
They had other ideas for me.
We need some help over here!
You sure are lucky, mister.
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
And while the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checkin' into an airport.
And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the Pyramids?
Junk bonds.
Still not sure?
Probable.
Maybe questionable.
Let me know as soon as you can find out.
But in the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that.
# Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights #
# Dreaming of a song #
# The melody haunts my memory #
# And I am once again with you #
# When our love was new #
# And each kiss an inspiration #
# Ah, but that was long ago #
# And now my consolation #
# Is in the stardust of a song #
# Beside a garden wall #
# When stars were bright #
# And you were in my arms #
# The nightingale told his fairy tale #
# Of paradise #
# Where roses grew #
# Though I dream in vain #
# In my heart #
# It will remain #
# My stardust melody #
# The memory #
# Of love's refrain ##
ADAPTED FROM A TRUE STORY
SAM: [Voiceover] When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.
There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.
Otherwise, what's the point?
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.
[Dramatic operatic music]
[Operatic music becomes calmer]
SAM:
Before I ever ran a casino, or got blown up...
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.
I can tell you that.
I was so good that whenever I bet, I'd change the odds... for every bookmaker in the country.
I'm serious, I had it down so cold... that I was given paradise on Earth.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money.
$62, 700,000.
I don't know all the details.
NICKY: [Voiceover] In fact, nobody knew all the details... but it should've been perfect.
He had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.
But in the end, we fucked it all up.
It should've been so sweet, too.
It turned out to be the last time that street guys like us... were ever given anything that fucking valuable again.
SAM:
Vegas was a place where suckers... flew in every year on their own nickel... and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
NICKY:
Got a lot of holes in the desert... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
Except you gotta do it right.
You gotta have the hole already dug... before you show up with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise, you're talking about 30 or 45 minutes of digging.
Who knows who's gonna be coming along in that time?
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.
You could be there all fucking night.
[Horns honking]
THE STRIP
- LAS VEGAS TEN YEARS EARLIER
[Upbeat jazz music]
SAM:
Who could resist?
Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler... always looking over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and went to work.
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.
SAM:
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.
It's like a morality car wash.
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.
[Upbeat jazz music intensifies]
SAM:
And along with making us legit... comes cash, tons of it.
What do you think we're doing here in the middle of the desert?
It's all this money.
This is the end result of all the bright lights... and the comped trips, of all the champagne... and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.
That's the truth about Las Vegas.
We're the only winners.
The players don't stand a chance.
And their cash flows from the tables... to our boxes through the cage... and into the most sacred room in the casino.
The place where they add up all the money... the Holy of holies, the count room.
Now, this place was off-limits.
Even I couldn't get inside.
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.
NICKY:
They had so much money in there... you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills.
And the best part was that upstairs... the Board of Directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
To them everything looked on the up-and-up.
Right?
Wrong.
Verify $5,000.
NICKY:
The guys in the counting room... were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
They'd even take cash right out of the drop-boxes.
And it was up to this guy right here... standing in front of $2 million... to skim the cash off the top without anybody getting wise... the IRS or anybody.
Notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.
Somehow, somebody's always looking the other way.
Look at these guys.
They look busy, right?
They're counting money.
Who wants to bother them?
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra $100 a week... just to watch the door.
It's routine.
Business as usual... in, out, hello, goodbye.
That's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walking out of a casino with a suitcase.
Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place:
Right to Kansas City, which was as close... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go... without getting themselves arrested.
That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.
And they wanted it every month.
Now this old Mormon fuck here... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.
- Something smells good.
- They made us something to eat.
NICKY:
The bosses would come from all over:
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee... all over the Midwest... and they would meet in this produce market in Kansas City.
Nobody even knew it.
One of the guys made his mother do the cooking.
Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
NICKY:
These old greaseballs might not look it... but believe me... these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.
WOMAN:
Mama, that man's here again.
NICKY:
Because they controlled the Teamsters Union.
And that's where you had to go to borrow money to buy a casino.
WOMAN 2:
Would you put in shrimp?
WOMAN:
I would.
NICKY:
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room... knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.
You got a round figure on it?
NICKY:
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
FRANK:
About 20 pounds.
Around $700,000.
REMO:
Good.
STONE:
It's a little early for Las Vegas... but I want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry...
SAM:
As far as the world was concerned...
Andy Stone, head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund... was a legitimate guy.
A powerful man.
He played golf with the President.
ANDY:
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...
I'm glad to present...
SAM:
But he also took orders.
When he was told to give a pension-fund loan to Philip Green this cheque for $62,700,000... for the new Tangiers.
...he did what he was told.
NICKY:
Here was the perfect front man.
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.
He didn't want to know too much... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him money.
He wanted to believe they gave him the money because he was smart.
I say that knowing just how much competition we have in this city.
[Upbeat jazz music]
NICKY:
And where they got Green from?
Who the fuck knows?
All I know is that he was an Arizona real-estate hustler... who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his fucking cheque.
And it was the bosses' man...
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.
Not the Chairman of the Board, Philip Green.
I understand.
[Upbeat jazz music intensifies]
NICKY:
Now all they needed was... someone they could trust to run the casino.
And who better than Ace?
He was already in Vegas a couple years... and he had the fucking place clocked.
But typical Ace, give him a shot to run a casino... and he tries to talk you out of it.
I don't know if I could do this.
The Gaming Commission would never give me a licence.
I have at least 24 gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You don't have to have a licence to work in a casino.
All you gotta do is apply for one.
The State law says that you can work in a casino... while they process your application.
ANDY:
They got a 10-year backlog.
What happens when they do find out?
ANDY:
Why would they want to find out?
We're putting $100 million here.
Why would they lock us out?
ANDY:
They'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.
Like, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.
Then they put your application at the bottom of the pile.
I know guys who've worked there for 30 years don't have a licence.
It's a tough proposition, Andy.
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
ANDY:
You got it.
I'm serious.
No interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.
I guarantee it.
[Upbeat jazz music]
NICKY:
And that's how they got Ace to take over.
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.
They worked out a real cute job title, too...
Tangiers Public Relations Director.
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.
He made his first bet when he was 15, and he always made money.
He didn't bet like you or me.
Having some fun with it, shit like that.
Where did you learn how to deal?
NICKY:
He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.
SAM:
Place the checks properly.
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.
NICKY:
He had to know everything.
He'd find out the inside stuff nobody else knew... and that's what he'd put his money on.
BACK HOME YEARS AGO Even back home, years ago... when we first hung out, he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...
I'll take Columbia for $20,000.
...if his girlfriend was knocked up.
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.
He even figured out the bounce you got off different kinds of wood... on college basketball courts.
He'd be working on this day and night.
He knew everything about a game he would bet on.
Ace got down at $6,000.
Get me down at $6,000.
NICKY:
Season after season... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.
But he was so serious about it all... that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.
But that's just the way he was.
Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck whether he enjoyed himself or not.
To them, he was a cash register.
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.
Especially Remo... who was a fucking degenerate gambler who always lost.
All those fucking sweeps.
NICKY:
Unless Ace made his bets.
Enough now!
NICKY:
Ace made more money for them on a weekend... than I could do heisting joints for a month.
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.
Fixed fights, doped horses... crooked fucking zebras, locked-in point spreads.
He told fucking Remo everything.
And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
Keeping Remo happy with money... was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Son of a bitch!
How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?
Nobody ever had Oklahoma...
How'd you do it?
That's why they paid so well.
REMO:
You see?
Never tells me nothing.
What do we got on for next week?
It's a little too early.
I'll know by Thursday.
Is that all right?
REMO:
You'll come by the house?
SAM:
I'll come by.
At 7:00.
REMO:
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up.
REMO:
Hey, Nick.
I'll be right out.
See that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.
He's making a lot of money for us.
And he'll continue making money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like the fucking Feds out there, without brains.
REMO:
Okay?
NICKY:
All right.
Want me to take this?
NICKY:
Now, on top of everything else...
I gotta make sure nobody fucks with the Golden Jew.
Couple of shooters for the ladies.
SAM:
Yeah, we made a great pair.
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.
The old men loved us, and why not?
They all made money with us.
How did Nicky collect?
Don't ask.
Then where the fuck is the money?
I don't see it.
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.
Who's this guy?
MAN:
Get the fuck out.
I laid nine.
NICKY:
It was eight.
NICKY:
Ace, tell him the line on the Bears game.
- Eight.
- Lf he don't know, nobody knows.
NICKY:
It was eight.
MAN:
How come I laid nine?
'Cause you're a jag-off.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Is this your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen.
Why?
It's nice.
I didn't know whose it was.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Thank you.
Why don't you take that fucking pen... and shove it up your ass, you fucking jag-off?
- Well, I was just offering...
- Asshole.
MAN:
Look out, Joe.
[Woman shrieking]
[Nicky grunting]
[Man groaning in pain]
[Pop music continues]
What's that?
You hear a little girl?
Is that a little fucking girl?
What happened to the tough guy... who told my friend to stick it up his fucking ass?
Nicky, take it easy.
[Man whimpering]
SAM:
While I tried to figure out why the guy said what he said...
Nicky just hit him.
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.
If you beat him with a gun, you'd better kill him... because he'll keep coming back and back... until one of you is dead.
[Pop music continues faintly]
NICKY:
With me protecting Ace... he made a fortune for the bosses.
That's what got him to Vegas.
He was a money machine.
A tremendous earner for these guys.
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fucking drop.
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.
[Rhythmic blues music]
SAM:
In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.
They were close to the good old boys.
Without us, these guys would still be shovelling mule shit.
You've got to keep a cleaner station.
If you need Mr. Clean, page him.
Won't happen again, Sam.
SAM:
Mr. Rothstein.
MAN:
It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
SAM:
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.
These yokels ran the state.
DEALER:
Thanks, Senator.
SAM:
They passed the laws, owned the courts.
I need a room.
SAM:
I had dozens of politicians and state officials coming through weekly.
SAM:
Get him what he wants.
BILLY:
Certainly.
SAM:
Why not make them happy?
[Upbeat RB music]
For politicians, like our State Senator up there... everything was on the house.
These guys won their comped life when they got elected.
Why not take advantage of it?
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.
It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat.
That's the one you really gotta watch.
He plays fast and big.
He has the cash and the credit... to turn out your lights.
A year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms... free private jets and $2 million of our money.
But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.
ICHIKAWA:
What went wrong?
BILLY:
I'm awfully sorry.
These mechanical things happen.
Better here than up there.
SAM:
Then he missed the flights connecting with Japan.
I can't believe there's no room.
SAM:
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.
- Sorry you missed your plane.
- You'd like some of my money back.
Oh, no.
No gambling.
[Upbeat RB music]
SAM:
And once he was back, he played small.
He bet $1,000 a hand, instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.
But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa... was that they can't bet small for long.
He didn't think of it as winning $10,000... he thought of it as losing $90,000.
So, he upped his bets.
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up $1 million of his own cash.
In a casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... and keep them coming back.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
In the end, we get it all.
[Upbeat RB music]
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.
Since the players are looking to beat the casino... the dealers are watching the players... the boxmen are watching the dealers... the floormen are watching the boxmen... the pit bosses are watching the floormen... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...
I'm watching the casino manager... and the eye in the sky is watching us all.
Plus, we had a dozen guys... most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.
[Upbeat RB music continues]
Yes!
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.
Looking good.
MAN:
Let's go.
This is for Ginger.
MAN:
Let me have $100 on your hard 10.
Thank you.
MAN:
Here we go now.
[Upbeat RB music]
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.
This $100 is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.
- Come on.
- What's the matter?
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.
What money?
I've seen you stealing.
"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.
GINGER:
I want my half.
GAMBLER:
I've watched you.
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of chips.
GINGER:
I didn't steal anything from you.
GAMBLER:
Get lost!
GINGER:
Get lost?
GAMBLER:
Yes!
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!
[Upbeat RB music continues]
[Romantic pop music]
SAM:
What a move.
I fell in love right there.
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.
[Romantic rock music]
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
SAM:
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
DOORMAN:
See you.
GINGER:
Thanks for asking.
SAM:
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers and helped them spend a lot of money.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger.
How you doing?
GINGER:
Great.
You might have something for me.
Got me covered?
GINGER:
Thank you.
VALET:
Take care of yourself.
I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
SAM:
Who didn't want her?
She was one of the best known... best liked and most respected hustlers in town.
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake... for two or three days before sending him home broke... to the little woman and his bank examiners.
[Romantic rock music continues]
Any change?
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.
SAM:
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.
GINGER:
How you doing tonight?
CASHIER:
Good.
CASHIER:
How are you?
GINGER:
Beat.
SAM:
Ginger had the hustlers' code.
GINGER:
Take one for you.
CASHIER:
Thank you.
SAM:
She knew how to take care of people.
That's what Vegas is all about.
CASHIER: $6,800.
GINGER:
Thanks.
SAM:
It's kickback city.
GINGER:
Have a good night.
SAM:
She took care of the dealers... pit bosses, floor managers... but, mostly, the valet parkers... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Ginger took care of the parkers... who took care of the security guards, who took care of the cops... who let her operate.
I need that stuff tonight.
VALET:
No problem.
GINGER:
You are a doll.
SAM:
The valet parking job was such a money-maker... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.
But one thing I didn't understand... was that she had everything under control... except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
I got other people in this.
I got partners.
I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?
You'll get yours back, and you'll get it back first.
Okay?
- All right.
- Where you going?
Where are you?
You're in that place.
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.
Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
- You are.
- I am.
SAM:
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
SAM:
He was a moocher, a card cheat... a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...
- chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.
SAM:
He was always broke.
He always had a story.
Somehow, she could never turn him down.
The way Ginger saw it was that he was just an unlucky guy.
Somebody had to take care of him.
BACK HOME
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
SAM:
He took care of himself only too well.
That's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
I folded these things beautifully.
I would appreciate a little respect.
Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
SAM:
Even after a vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Frank Marino was there to meet him.
So were the cops.
They wanted to pinch him...
- for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Help me fold these.
SAM:
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where.
They were usually right.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.
And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
GINGER:
There we go.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
SAM:
I mean that's what worried me... 'cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
JENNIFER:
All right, we're clear.
NICKY:
There's more.
NICKY:
There's a couple stuck in there.
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.
What's that?
There's no more.
Thanks.
NICKY:
I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.
But the bosses didn't send me out to have a good time.
They sent me out to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.
And nobody interfered with the fucking skim.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?
Hey, Sammy.
- Boy, look at this place.
- Incredible.
SAM:
Welcome to Vegas.
NICKY:
Okay, Sammy.
SAM:
Something, huh?
Ginger.
Holy shit.
What've you been doing out here?
SAM:
Honey, come here.
This is Jennifer and Nick.
They're dear friends of mine.
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.
Okay, Sammy.
SAM:
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger... and we took a ride to talk.
And then, he hit me with it.
What do you think about me moving out here?
You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
You mean I have your permission?
Sure, you do.
But I just gotta tell you... it's no joke out here.
You gotta keep a low profile.
It's not like back home.
They don't like guys like us.
This sheriff's a real cowboy.
Even coppers aren't afraid to bury people in the desert.
I don't care.
I want to get away from back home for a while.
I'm tired of that shit back there.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.
I got pinched twice for no reason.
I really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
NICKY:
Ace saw Vegas one way...
NICKY:
Call and tell him I'm coming?
JACK:
Of course.
...but I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.
They had bookies, pimps, and drug dealers I could shake down.
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?
So I started getting everybody in line.
Best of all, for the first time in my life...
I figured out a way not to lose.
SAM:
He had a foolproof scheme.
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.
When he won, he collected.
When he lost, he told the bookies to fuck off.
What were they gonna do?
Muscle Nicky?
Nicky was the muscle.
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?
Nicky, I thought you was laying.
I was laying?
No, I'm taking it.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?
Maybe if I stick your fucking face through this window... you'll get unconfused.
- Give me the fucking money.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it.
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was laying it.
- My fucking head.
- Smarten up.
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first President.
George Washington was born...
SAM:
But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.
We presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town... like regular Ozzie and Harriets.
COACH:
You got a beautiful swing.
NICKY:
Ace got Little Nicky involved with Little League.
It was great.
Turned out that one of the other coaches was a metro intelligence cop.
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.
He's gotta realise everything can't be a home run.
That's exactly what I tell him, but that's the kind of kid he is.
[People applauding]
SAM:
And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work... people got the message.
NICKY:
Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.
I was to make sure no other crews robbed the joint.
Like these two fucking balloon heads over here.
They were gonna try to bang us out of $200,000.
Yeah, right, I'm sure.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm over here now.
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.
He was here before.
He had a suitcase, and then he left.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's out?
I think he went across the street or somewhere else or something.
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.
- Thanks, Eddy.
- Lots of luck.
Good luck to you, too.
CASHIER:
They forgot to sign their papers.
They don't need those anymore.
SAM:
Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning.
Everybody else, watch out.
Like these yokels here... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.
They're the morons who give you the most trouble.
We'd catch them and they'd try to sneak back... with beards and wigs and fake noses.
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.
Like this guy.
He's betting lavender chips... at $500 each with only one little problem.
He's always guessed right.
If he wasn't so fucking greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
But in the end, they're all greedy.
[Upbeat rock music]
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.
He just wasn't protecting his hand.
He was lifting his hole card way too high.
Here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card... and signalling his buddy at this table.
[Metallic clicking]
And that's just what these hustlers look for.
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers... the way lions look for weak antelope.
Operator, this is Mr. R.
Get me Armstrong and Friday over to Pit 2 right away.
[Upbeat rock music continues]
BJ 19, second base, the beard.
Operator, I need Mr. Happy.
Loud.
WAITRESSES: [Singing] Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Jeff
Happy birthday to you
[Electric zap]
GUARD:
Man down!
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.
SAM:
They never know what hit them.
If and when they do find out they got zapped by a cattle prod... they wish they really did have a heart attack.
Turns out this guy and his fucking pals were knocking this place dead for years.
GUARD 1:
He's wired.
HUSTLER:
What are you doing?
GUARD 1:
There it is.
That's it.
GUARD 2:
Cheater's justice.
HUSTLER:
Oh, God!
[Saw whirring]
No!
SAM:
I wanted everybody to know that things were changed around here.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand.
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.
SAM:
You can't do it with both hands?
HUSTLER:
No, sir.
- Can you do it with your left hand?
- I never tried.
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
- It's $100,000, $110,000 I think.
- Yes, it is.
Okay.
Hi.
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it?
A little privacy.
By the way, send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.
CASHIER:
Sure will.
BILLY:
Real special.
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
BILLY:
Having a good time?
HUSTLER 2:
Yes.
You want to count the money in privacy.
HUSTLER 2:
I have a plane to catch.
Can I get my winnings?
Look what they did to my hand, man.
SAM:
I'm gonna give you a choice:
You can have the money and the hammer, or you can walk out of here.
- What do you want?
- I wanna get out of here.
Tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fucking right.
SAM:
If you come back, either one of you, we'll break your fucking heads.
You see that fucking saw?
We're gonna use it.
We don't fuck around here.
SAM:
Got it?
HUSTLER 2:
Yes.
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.
Throw him out in the alley.
Tell the cops he got hit by a car.
SAM:
Within no time, everything was set in place.
We got rid of the freelance scamsters, the pro was way up... the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.
And I decided to complicate my life.
For a guy who likes sure things...
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.
We're not getting any younger.
Don't you think it's time?
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?
Banging around, hustling around?
- Are you trying to handicap me?
- I'm gonna do you one better.
I'm trying to marry you.
SAM:
You wanna marry me?
SAM:
I'm serious.
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.
What do you know?
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.
I can't think of anybody better to be with.
I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people?
'Cause I don't.
I know all that.
[Sighs]
I care about you.
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.
SAM:
All right.
GINGER:
Understand?
GINGER:
I'm sorry.
No...
That can grow.
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.
SAM:
What is love anyway?
SAM:
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.
It's a caring from one person to another.
And if we could set up some kind of foundation... based on that mutual respect...
I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out... if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.
So whatever happens... if it doesn't work out between us...
I'll make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.
If there are kids, especially...
I'll take care of you better than you'd imagine.
GINGER:
What are you pitching me?
SAM:
Just what I said.
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.
That I can promise you.
Want to take a chance?
[Applause and clinking glasses]
[Romantic instrumental music]
SAM:
When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories... but I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.
I can change her.
NICKY:
It was typical Ace.
He invited the biggest people in town.
He knew they'd show.
He knew they all wanted something from him.
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.
Even Ginger.
With her, he still covered his bets.
They had to have the baby first, before they could get married.
He even made us watch Amy for a few days... when they went on their honeymoon.
I didn't mind, we loved the kid.
LESTER:
Can you feel my eyes on you?
Can you feel me look into your heart?
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?
Can you feel me in you?
In your heart?
Don't make me come there.
Answer me.
GINGER: [Crying] I love you.
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?
GINGER:
No, Lester.
LESTER:
Do you know that?
GINGER:
Yes.
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.
Promise?
I wish you all the luck in the world.
GINGER:
You do?
LESTER:
Yeah, I do.
It's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
You have real security.
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
Come on.
This is great for us.
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.
I'm looking at you right now.
I'm seeing you for the very first time, right this minute.
I'm saying I can feel my heart click.
I see you 14 years old.
I see you the first second I ever saw you.
I see you, long-legged little colt... stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
LESTER:
Every time I see you, that's what I see.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
- Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
- I'm okay.
[Ginger sniffles]
You just have to understand.
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I just...
I think I have a right to do that.
GINGER:
Okay?
It's all right.
That part of your life is over with.
SAM:
Right?
GINGER:
Yeah.
You're with me now.
- Yeah.
- Right?
SAM:
You're sure?
GINGER:
Yeah.
SAM:
Want to go?
Let's go back in.
GINGER:
Okay.
[Soothing instrumental music]
GINGER:
It's great.
[Soothing music continues]
[Ginger exclaims in delight]
GINGER:
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.
You brought all my stuff!
I can't...
Try it on.
It's yours.
You're kidding.
My God.
- What is it?
- It's chinchilla.
It's so soft.
Nice, isn't it?
No one's ever been so nice to me.
[Exclaiming]
GINGER:
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's too much if I wear these all on the same day?
You can do whatever you want.
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?
You're so wonderful.
The jewellery's not so bad either.
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.
Come on.
Can I keep this one in the house?
Pay attention to me.
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
SAM:
With over $1 million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas... only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.
She loved that shit.
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take cheques.
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?
SAM:
So I put $2 million cash in a Los Angeles bank... under the name of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money most...
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.
[Upbeat pop music]
This is just a signature card.
Once she signs, she'll be the only person... to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?
BANKER:
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
You must really trust your wife.
Sure I do.
Why?
It's good.
It's just unusual.
To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
[Singing romantic ballad]
SAM:
With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.
To play it safe, I switched job titles again... and made myself Food and Beverage Director.
This way nobody would bother me about a licence.
Vegas was like a dream for me.
Trouble was Nicky was dreaming of his own kind of Vegas.
NICKY:
I put money out on the street charging three points a week.
Juice to the dealers.
- Don't make us look for you.
- You won't have to look for me.
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.
NICKY:
They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.
In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.
Then, the next thing I did, I started busting out high-stakes poker players.
SAM:
It was so obvious.
All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were signal-happy.
I'm gonna open for $500.
SAM:
Signalling back and forth.
[Gamblers chattering]
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.
I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.
GAMBLER 2:
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.
SAM:
I wished Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?
Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.
I can't do that.
Gaming agents are all over the place.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.
NICKY:
Ace was so worried about his casino... he forgot what we were doing out here in the first place.
A million times, I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:
"This is Las Vegas.
"We're supposed to be out here robbing, you dumb fucking hebe."
[Lively pop music playing]
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.
Tell him to take his feet off the table.
Does he think this is a goddamn sawdust joint?
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table... and put your shoes on, please?
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.
Fucking asshole won't budge.
Call security.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Do me a favour.
Want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes on?
Fuck you.
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, off his feet... and use his head to open the fucking door.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
You mind coming with us outside?
Bullshit.
I ain't going anywhere with you.
GUARD:
Bullshit.
You're out of here.
MAN:
Fuck you!
MAN:
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?
MAN:
Leave me alone!
GUARD:
Come on!
MAN:
You gotta be kidding me!
SAM:
Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?
I didn't know that.
You know what he did?
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.
SAM:
Then he called me a faggot.
NICKY:
What?
SAM:
I threw that cocksucker out.
NICKY:
Come here.
You called my friend a faggot?
Told him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
NICKY: [On phone] You fucking hick, you!
NICKY:
You go over there.
You apologise.
NICKY:
You better hope he lets you back in.
If you get out of line again, I'll smash your head so hard... you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on.
Fucking hick.
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.
He's already very sorry.
But if you could do me a favour and let him back in...
I swear he'll never get out of line again.
If he does it again, he's out for good.
I'll never let him in the place again.
NICKY:
I'm sorry about this.
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?
You shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.
NICKY:
Go over and apologise.
MAN:
Nicky, I'm sorry.
NICKY:
Ace could be a very touchy guy.
Especially when he got bigger in town.
Like when he hired Jonathan and David away from the Palace... by building them a new stage and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.
But, I tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.
He knew all the fucking angles.
He brought the whole Femme Fatale show from Paris... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.
He had to weigh them once a week so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.
You're still eight pounds over.
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir...
Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to use respect.
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them...
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.
I don't know why.
She's frightened if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris...
- It's been our policy...
- Stop everything.
AGENT:
She's an institution.
SAM:
That's the problem.
She's lazy.
NICKY:
I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.
So why not take advantage, right?
So he took bookie joints off the street... and opened them up inside the casino.
Within a few years, he had... every casino on The Strip trying to copy off of him.
SAM:
Between my innovations... and Nicky's dedication to his job...
I soon had the best operation on The Strip.
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you.
Why, somebody is complaining?
I'm hearing things from security.
They're all ex-cops.
The sheriff wants to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.
There's two names in it for the whole country... and one of them is still Al Capone.
They put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.
You won't be able to walk into a casino.
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.
I'm just telling you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
[Upbeat swing music]
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.
Very nice.
Thank you.
[People chattering]
PHILIP:
For his hard work and dedication... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member... of the gaming community.
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation... it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein... to the Vegas Valley Country Club.
[Applause]
SAM:
Back home, they'd put me in jail for what I'm doing.
But out here, they're giving me awards.
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation... from the Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.
SAM:
But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife work the room.
They all loved her.
How could you not love her?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.
LADY:
We'd love to have her there.
3:00, Saturday.
- Yes, okay.
- Great.
SAM:
She made everybody feel good.
- Congratulations, Sam.
- Thanks.
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've seen.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.
Thanks for that compliment.
SAM:
He was a young kid from the casino.
Nice kid.
Bright boy.
What balls on this fucking kid.
The next day I fired him.
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.
GINGER:
Do you wanna see this one?
[Ginger exclaims]
GINGER:
Daddy gave me all this jewellery because he loves me so much.
SAM:
But as much as they loved her...
GINGER:
Fabulous.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
GINGER:
Look at this.
GINGER:
Daddy gave me...
SAM:
With Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doing back there?
You can't even see them.
Okay.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots?
These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.
No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front.
- Bring them up front.
- All right, I will.
Listen carefully.
There are three ways of doing things here.
The right way, the wrong way, and the way that I do it.
- Understand?
- I do understand.
I'll get right on it.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Just do it.
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Dang, you are right.
I'm so sorry.
SAM:
So I ended up working 18-hour days.
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?
I told him that I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.
You might as well get something out of it.
SAM:
It wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Vegas.
From then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in or near Vegas.
NICKY:
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"...detrimental to gaming and...
"he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.
"And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000...
"every time he shows up."
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, you got banned.
"Because of notorious and unsavoury reputation."
Motherfucker.
[Nostalgic country music]
- Is there any way around this?
- No, there's no way.
Let's say, for instance...
I want to go into the restaurant, which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it.
You can't even set foot in the parking lot.
That's how serious it is.
- In other words, I'm fucked?
- In so many words, yes.
SAM:
It didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.
Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.
You're listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do something.
They ain't getting rid of me.
They're not getting rid of me.
I'm staying here.
Fuck them.
NICKY:
So once they pulled that shit...
I started doing my own things in Vegas nobody had thought of doing.
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother and some desperados... from back home and started knocking over high rollers, casino bosses... bookmakers, anybody right here in town.
I had a good fucking crew going for me, I'll tell you that.
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.
Jack Hardy worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.
Then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy could bypass any alarm for me.
It was like old times.
I opened up my own jewellery store, too.
The Gold Rush.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.
I didn't like the people I was ripping off looking at me... so I turned their fucking pictures around.
NICKY:
What's taking so long?
JACK:
This is a motherfucker!
It's working.
NICKY:
Learn to open these instead of taking them.
NICKY:
These stones got a lot of niggers in them.
If that fucking Pepe's switching stones on us... he better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.
[Phone rings]
- They're in Penthouse "K."
- Check in alone?
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?
- Yes.
Don't worry.
- All right.
Thanks.
SAM:
He had tipsters all over town.
Bellmen...
- You got to hurry.
- Okay.
...valet parkers...
- They're just checking in now.
- I'll tell him.
...pit bosses...
Room 1230 at the Scirocco.
- 1230.
Right.
...secretaries.
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition?
All right.
SAM:
They all got a piece of the score.
MAN:
Car's coming.
[Energetic rock music]
SAM:
They were very careful.
They always bypassed the alarms, or else, if not... they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.
NICKY:
What the fuck did they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?
- This diamond has flaws in it.
- There's no flaws in it.
Don't tell me.
I'm doing this for 25 years.
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws in this diamond.
NICKY:
When we got local merch... we'd usually send it to Palm Springs, or Arizona, L.A.
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.
Are you gonna have a meeting or buy some diamonds?
I know his language.
I'm talking with him.
$40,000, you buy the whole package.
$20,000.
That's my final offer.
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.
NICKY:
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush in case we got raided by the cops... or if my crew got cute.
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.
She fell asleep on the couch watching TV every night.
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.
The bosses were making so much money with the casinos... that they didn't want anybody making any waves.
You've all given your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.
NICKY:
That's why there was no real organised street stuff in Vegas before I came.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind... you must be prepared to take some kind of loss.
NICKY:
I put some money in legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.
- You will try to push it through, won't you?
- Yes.
You got to understand, I'm giving you $50,000 cash.
NICKY:
Then I put more money in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
DOMINICK:
Is that the last one?
COOK:
Yeah.
NICKY:
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it.
Fuckers.
DOMINICK:
Here you go, guys.
- Thanks a lot.
- Enjoy it.
Have a good time.
- Choke on it, motherfucker.
- Hi, Dom.
How you doing?
SAM:
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.
And over the years, he always made money with them.
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over.
That show at The Flamingo gets better and better.
By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call.
- Made you a messenger, too?
- I'll do anything for a buck.
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.
SAM:
I got to tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.
To them, Nicky was the movie star.
- You walk past me?
- This is Shelly.
- Hi, Shelly.
How are you?
- Hi.
This is Stacy.
- This is Nick.
Wanna have dinner?
Come on.
- All right.
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.
NICKY:
Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.
You can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.
NICKY:
Lt'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?
AL:
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?
You call yourself a man?
You know you're a lying lowlife, motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent... and buy groceries, put the heat on.
You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fucking heat's off?
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?
- No, you didn't?
- I didn't.
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?
Tell me you gambled the money and I'll give you the money to put the heat on!
Did you gamble?
Fucking degenerate, you.
Fucking kids at home.
Here.
Get the fuck out of here.
AL:
Thanks, Nick.
NICKY:
Yeah, thanks.
If I find out you fucked up, I'll leave you where I find you.
NICKY:
How many of these you gonna eat?
NICKY JR:
Two.
SAM:
At around 6:30 a.m., when he finished his day... no matter where he was or what he was doing... he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.
NICKY:
I know you like this.
NICKY:
A little butter, right?
Not a lot.
You know why, right?
NICKY:
Why?
NICKY JR: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are.
NICKY:
Okay, eat.
NICKY:
Every couple of weeks, I sent Marino back to the bosses...
BACK HOME with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.
Their drop was a truck stop garage... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
NICKY:
I knew how to keep the bosses happy.
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message...
I would carry things out to a "T."
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town... shot up one of Remo's bars.
Here's a fucking guy who kills two of Remo's guys... and a poor fucking waitress who was just working on her night off.
This guy's just begging to be made an example of.
I want the names of all the other people he had with him.
I don't care what you have to do to them to get them.
You understand?
FRANK:
I'll take care of it.
NICKY:
To be truthful with you, I had to admire this fucking guy.
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.
This son of a bitch was tough.
For two days and two nights, we beat the shit out of him.
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.
NICKY:
Hope he gives me a name, or I'll give him yours, Frank.
FRANK:
Thanks a lot.
NICKY:
But he never talked.
NICKY:
I know you would've ratted by now.
NICKY:
In the end, I had to put his fucking head in a vice.
NICKY:
Can you hear me?
Listen to me.
I got your head in a vice.
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.
NICKY:
Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Fuck you.
Motherfucker.
You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.
Fuck me?
You motherfucker!
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?
You motherfucker!
Oh, God.
Give me the fucking name!
Charlie M.
- Charlie M.
- Charlie M?
You make me pop your eye out your head... to protect that piece of shit?
You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck!
You motherfucker!
Frankie, do him a fucking favour.
SAM:
Word got around that finally... there was a real gangster in town.
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.
NICKY:
Charlie M.
[Coins clinking]
SAM:
Four reels, sevens across.
Three $15,000 jackpots.
You have any idea what the odds are?
It's gotta be in the millions.
Maybe more.
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?
Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?
It happened quick.
Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.
You didn't see the scam?
There's no way to determine that.
Yes, there is.
An infallible way.
They won!
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.
You're pissing me off.
You're insulting my intelligence.
You think I'm an idiot?
Somebody had to get into those machines and set the reels.
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.
It can't happen.
SAM:
What's the matter with you?
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?
- You didn't see that?
- I think you're overreacting.
Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.
I've carried your ass ever since I got here.
Get your things and get out of here.
- You're firing me?
- I'm firing you.
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.
- This is not the way to treat people.
- Lf you didn't know about the scam... you're too dumb to work here.
If you did, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.
Go on.
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.
You can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.
Everyone out here with cowboy boots is a commissioner or related to one.
I'm sick of this.
This is his state.
His uncle's Chief Judge.
His brother-in-law runs the County Commission.
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
You're in the finances, upstairs.
You don't see what's going on.
I've got thousands of players.
I got 500 dealers.
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.
That there is not one single thing I will not catch.
SAM:
Look at yours.
Look at that.
SAM:
Look at this.
There's nothing.
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.
- I have nothing.
- What are you talking about?
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
PHILIP:
Where are you going?
SAM:
From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
Do you know how long that will take?
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.
Just a little.
That a girl.
SAM:
Wanna go to Mummy?
GINGER:
Wanna come to Mummy?
It's all right, sweetheart.
GINGER:
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.
- What do you need?
- Got her?
I need a lot.
I need more than usual.
Why don't you take it out of your account?
I would, it's just that...
I need more than that.
I need $25,000.
$25,000?
- For yourself?
- Yeah.
SAM:
Why do you need that much?
What's the difference?
I just need it.
I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.
It's not a box of popcorn.
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.
We don't have to have a fight.
GINGER:
It was important to me.
Forget it.
Something I wanted to do.
Who's fighting?
Tell me what it's for.
Why can't you tell me what it's for?
Now I want you to tell me.
My wife comes to me and asks me for $25,000.
Do you want a coat?
GINGER:
No.
SAM:
If you want a coat, you got it.
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?
I've been independent all my life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
Now you're making me beg you for this.
- What are you talking about?
- Okay?
And you're embarrassing me.
Why make me feel so bad?
SAM:
You're asking me for $25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.
It's about trust.
I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Answer me.
You can trust me.
Good.
So then you can tell me what the money is for.
[Sentimental jazz music]
She's leaving the bank now.
I'll follow her.
LESTER:
What is that?
I know that look.
What does that look mean?
GINGER:
It means I got the money.
How are you doing?
It's Lester, right?
Sam.
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?
SAM:
If I'm wrong, correct me.
I never knew you to be a heist man.
But if you are, you know what?
Here, take mine, too.
Take it.
You already have hers.
She's my wife.
SAM:
Look at me.
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew she's my wife?
SAM:
Look at me.
LESTER:
I know that.
SAM:
You do, yeah?
If you ever come back again... to take her money, next time bring a pistol.
That way you got a chance.
Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.
Now, you want to do me a favour?
Get out of here.
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get the fuck up and get out of here.
SAM:
Fucking piece of shit.
Remember when you called him that night and said goodbye to him?
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."
- He didn't say that, did he?
- No, he didn't.
What did he say?
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."
Come here.
I want to show you something.
[Men shouting]
[Car horn honking]
GINGER:
Make them stop it!
[Ginger screaming hysterically]
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!
[Ginger continues screaming]
THUG:
Piece of shit.
LESTER:
Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!
He's such a prick.
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.
He didn't want to do it himself.
He didn't want to get his own hands dirty.
Why did he have to do that?
Tell me.
NICKY:
It wasn't a nice thing to do...
GINGER:
No shit.
You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down.
I told him all about this guy before we got married.
- This is no fucking surprise.
- You did?
I didn't know that.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?
The first time I ever saw you guys together...
I never saw him so happy.
NICKY:
I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I think he's crazy about you.
He really loves you.
NICKY:
He does.
GINGER:
Come on.
I went into this with my eyes open.
GINGER:
I knew the bottom could drop out any time.
I'm a working girl.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this... if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?
Sure, I can see that.
So he put aside some jewellery for me.
A lot of jewellery.
A lot of expensive jewellery?
About how much?
You want to steal it?
No.
I'm just curious.
I was wondering... how much he would put into a thing like that.
I'm told it's worth about $1 million, maybe more.
NICKY:
There you go.
What does that tell you?
$1 million in jewellery.
Does that tell you he is crazy about you?
I should have never married him.
He's a Gemini.
Triple Gemini.
Duality.
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.
I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.
This is probably not...
I don't have the answers anyway.
- This is probably not what you want to hear.
- I do.
You're a little upset, and I understand that.
But try to make the best of it now.
Go slow.
See what happens.
He could've killed him!
He didn't have to hit him.
I'm not sleeping with the guy.
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.
What the fuck is that all about?
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worries.
Who gives a fuck what I do?
I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Thanks... for putting up with me.
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl.
Don't ruin that.
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You're so nice.
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.
Thanks.
It's all right.
[Phone ringing]
County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.
Just a minute.
RECEPTIONIST:
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you, little lady.
Send him in and call me four minutes after.
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
How do you do?
- It is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.
PAT:
Thank you, sir.
House is doing well.
All that money is rolling in.
I appreciate you taking the time to see a poor old civil servant.
SAM:
Why don't you have a seat?
PAT:
Thank you, sir.
PAT:
I come here personally to smooth over... any fracas about a certain matter.
Maybe you didn't know it... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends.
His family and their money go back many years.
Friends vote, family and money votes.
That's important to me and you.
If you'll think about our little problem along them lines... and you'll forgive me for saying it... maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
He knew about our getting hit... on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.
Either he was in on it or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don... we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he'd be under arrest.
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky?
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.
What you're saying is libellous.
You're in no position to challenge my expertise.
I went way out of my way to be helpful and courteous to that kid.
He's weak.
He's incompetent.
He jeopardises the whole place.
There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there.
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.
[Pat coughs]
But he is my brother-in-law... and I would look on it as a personal favour... if you'd think some more on hiring him back.
I can't do that.
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law.
I do want to help you and I like to do favours.
And I know who you are.
But I cannot do that.
Could there be any position... farther down the trough?
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.
He's too incompetent.
The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.
[Phone ringing]
SAM:
Okay, thanks a lot.
That's it.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.
You're all just our guests.
But you act like you're at home.
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.
But that's where we'll send you if it harelips the Governor.
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- You bet.
SAM:
What happened to my pills?
Isn't it bad enough you drink too much?
You're taking my pills, too?
GINGER:
I didn't take your pills.
For my ulcer, I take a half of one of these.
That's when I have extreme pain.
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with them?
GINGER: [Crying] You didn't have to beat him up.
SAM:
What?
GINGER:
I was just trying to help him.
GINGER:
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.
Yeah, how do I know?
GINGER:
You can't make me stop caring about people.
SAM:
What?
GINGER:
I said... you can't make me stop caring about people.
SAM:
Listen...
I'm trying to make the best of everything here.
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.
People look up to you in this town.
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit.
I'm getting out of here.
SAM:
You gotta get a hold of yourself.
GINGER:
Okay.
SAM:
If not for me, at least for Amy.
SAM:
Understand?
Your drinking's getting way out of hand.
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.
That's all you care about.
GINGER:
You don't care about me.
SAM:
Yes, I do.
GINGER:
No, you don't.
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that stuff, that fucking leech living off you.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.
You're gonna do it.
Oh, God.
[Ginger sobbing]
I'll try.
GINGER:
I will.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
NICKY:
No matter what the problems were outside the count room... it was all worth it.
The cash kept rolling in... and the suitcases kept coming and going.
And let me tell you, the fucking bottom line here is cash.
The only problem was that after a while... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me... that the money we're robbing is being robbed?
Somebody's robbing from us?
We go through all this fucking trouble and somebody's robbing us?
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.
NICKY:
Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the scam... he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal... even if you take care of him real well... he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.
Makes sense, don't it?
Right?
You go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that.
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?
It defeats the whole purpose of what we're doing.
They take this money because they're my guys, so give them some leeway.
NICKY:
But the bosses never believed in leeway... so listen to what they do.
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C... in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.
BOSS:
What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.
BOSS:
What were you doing with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.
NICKY:
The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.
BOSS:
What you been doing?
ARTIE:
I'm out there more than I'm here.
NICKY:
Little did anybody know where this would lead.
If they did, they would've been better off making fucking novenas.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
- My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
- What expenses?
I'm laying money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back.
You gotta go back out there.
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping records.
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?
I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.
What the hell are we doing over here?
You're going to Las Vegas and having a good time at my expense.
What the fuck?
I mean, after all...
SAM:
No matter how many novenas you could make... nothing was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
PHILIP:
I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA:
We made a deal.
SAM:
It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity"... had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and demanded money from Tangiers...
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because you're wrong.
ANNA:
I'm not.
PHILIP:
You are.
No, I am not wrong.
...Green tried to stonewall her.
ANNA:
I will see that you don't get away with this.
So, she sued him in court.
The court will now hear the matter of Anna Scott... against Tangiers Corporation and its President, Philip Green.
OBERON:
Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN:
Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.
JUDGE:
Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON:
Thank you.
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.
We got a problem.
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing.
That's not good.
NICKY:
She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit.
But before she could start counting her money... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.
So they sent me.
REPORTER:
Any comment on the murder of Anna Scott?
What are you talking about?
REPORTER:
She was found last night shot in the head.
MAN:
Was this just a real estate partnership?
MAN 2:
Her lawyer said you were partners.
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
MAN:
Did you ever hear of the.22 calibre killer?
SAM:
Now, Instead of the cops only looking at Nicky... they started looking at Green, too.
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew... the casino was on the up-and-up.
So how often do you really fill in for him?
Green's here about two or three times a month... and he's busy with other real estate deals, and things.
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?
I serve at the pleasure of the Chairman of the Board.
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss... when Mr. Green is away.
You could say that.
PAT:
Have you read this?
About Mr. Rothstein.
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties...
"says that he is the real boss of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."
PAT:
Do you believe that?
OFFICIAL:
Did he really say that?
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.
Has that man even filed for his licence yet?
I don't know.
We have to check the files.
Without getting your shorts in a knot, would you do that?
And check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.
PAT:
Thank you.
A Gaming Control Board investigation of Tangiers executive...
Sam Rothstein's application for a gaming licence is underway.
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino operation and is a boyhood friend... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro... could lose his ability to work in the casino...
[Phone rings]
Hello?
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.
NICKY:
No, it's okay.
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible.
It's booked up, and it's very difficult to get in.
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.
All right.
The battle between state gaming officials and Tangiers casino boss...
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing... despite law-enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organised crime connections.
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with organised crime figure, Nicky Santoro... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers casino?
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardised by a boyhood friendship?
SAM:
Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?
Come on.
Let me help you down.
We're talking about some stuff.
NEWSCASTER:
At 6:00, will a boyhood friendship... unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers casino boss?
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.
Go down.
Just go downstairs.
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.
It's just a political witch hunt.
SAM:
Do you want something to drink?
- Charlie, you want a refill?
- Yeah, that would be great.
I don't want nothing.
Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.
- You're tougher to get than the President.
- I've been busy.
Yeah?
At least you could return my phone calls, though.
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.
I think I want my money back.
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.
I think, in all fairness...
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank... and walk in and see, and if you don't have my money for me...
I'll crack your fucking head wide open in front of everybody.
And just about the time that I'm coming out of jail... hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.
And guess what?
I'll split your fucking head open again.
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.
That's my business.
That's what I do.
We know what you do.
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like that.
NICKY:
You fat Irish prick!
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.
- You think he got the point?
- What are you doing?
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.
That prick's been dodging me for three weeks.
- You're trying to tell me what to do?
- I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
You're way out of line.
Where's your head?
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.
If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you?
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me... you're gonna have to go my way.
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.
SAM:
I got $100 million a year going through the place.
It's all over if I don't get that licence.
Believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.
Forget about your fucking licence.
I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a licence.
I don't know what it is, but the more I talk to you... the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right.
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my licence.
I want everything quiet.
That's it!
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?
That's quiet?
It's taken out of context.
I had no control.
Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
Back home that looks bad.
Looks bad?
Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to you?
You lost control?
- I lost control?
You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore.
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat people with disrespect.
Even your own wife.
My wife?
What does she have to do with this?
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that Lester Diamond incident.
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?
No, that's not the fucking point.
The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life.
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.
A week ago it was.
Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.
Right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.
This guy's gonna run to the FBI.
NICKY:
Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.
SAM:
I knew what he wanted and I didn't want any part of it.
He wanted to take over.
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.
He also stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.
They questioned Nicky.
A lawyer.
They questioned Nicky.
When some guys who didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.
There were never any witnesses.
NICKY:
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.
NICKY:
If a guy tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.
Be nice.
NICKY:
The bosses were no better.
They complained because things don't run smooth.
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth.
I'm sorry.
I'm dealing with degenerate animals out here.
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?
They're sitting on their asses drinking anisette.
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.
Fucking bosses think it's a fucking free lunch out here.
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?
I heard.
Everybody's talking about it and making a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
What are you gonna do?
That's no good.
Tell him to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
NICKY:
Fucking bosses smoking their Di Nobilis... and eating trip' and fucking soffrit', fried pigs' guts... while if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.
- What do they care?
Long as I send money.
- They're complaining.
Let them complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.
NICKY:
Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
FRANK:
It's up to you.
NICKY:
They want a fucking war?
I'm ready.
If I take care of five of those guys, the rest will fall into place.
NICKY:
Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
SAM:
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself, but on me, too.
The FBI watched every move he made, but he just didn't care.
NICKY:
If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch them back.
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment from the same places that sell to the CIA.
I had all the special police frequency radios, FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras...
So, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.
SAM:
I got my job on the line, he's having the time of his life.
He has every cop in the state watching him, and he's out playing golf.
And at the worst possible time for me.
I had my licence hearing coming up and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.
If I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us with the books and papers.
That'll mean a lot when you go before the commission.
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This honesty will guarantee it.
[Plane engine sputtering]
We'll move on to...
SAM:
I want to hear about Kansas City.
What the fuck is this?
Where's this fucking guy gonna land, in the fairway?
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
SAM:
The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long... they ran out of gas.
Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.
$100, whoever hits the plane.
SAM:
If things weren't bad enough... in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases.
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.
SAM:
He ran it with his brother-in-law... but he mostly complained about his trips to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.
You gotta lay down the law, or they'll make a fool out of you.
I write it all down.
Every fucking nickel goes down.
- What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble, I'll take the eyes out of his freaking head.
- Again.
- I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.
SAM:
What happens next, you can't believe it.
Who'd believe the FBI had a wire in the place...
looking for information about some old homicide... about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what?
What prevents him with the suitcases from taking what he wants?
Nance brings back two suitcases from the Tangiers.
What about three or four?
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.
He's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together.
I'll find out.
If it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard.
I never trusted him.
I got eyes behind my head.
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.
I'll hit the two of them in the head with a shovel.
MA:
Take it easy.
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beating me left and right.
ARTIE:
I'm sorry.
I'm upset.
I know, but that's enough.
You know what they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.
MA:
Take it easy.
You'll get a heart attack.
ARTIE:
I know.
I'm too upset.
SAM:
The damn thing is, they hear all this stuff... about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases... and that's it.
[Sentimental swing music]
ARTIE:
Everything's coming out of my pocket.
I gotta pay.
SAM:
Would you believe this could happen?
ARTIE:
I'm in this to make money, not lose it.
SAM:
Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now.
ARTIE:
If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
SAM:
Piscano, this guy, basically sunk the whole world.
MA:
There are some that are good and some that are bad.
COUNSELLOR:
Members of the Commission...
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
SAM:
When the day finally came, I was ready.
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.
COUNSELLOR:
We have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBI agents... which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.
- Counsellor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked this Commission acts on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
COUNSELLOR:
Denying?
SENATOR:
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.
Do I have a vote on the motion?
- Aye!
- Aye!
Aye!
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned?
What do you mean?
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBI reports.
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?
SENATOR:
I was never your guest.
SAM:
Never my guest?
I never comped you?
I don't comp you at least three times a month?
I'd like to answer that at this time.
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at the dinner?
SENATOR:
You were wandering around.
SAM:
Was I at that dinner?
SENATOR:
You were wandering.
SENATOR:
You were in the building.
SAM:
I was in the building?
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.
Did you not?
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.
SAM:
Give me that much at least!
SENATOR:
Yes, you were.
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein... accused top gaming officials of corruption.
...promised me a fair hearing when you were comped at my hotel?
And you asked for copies of your bill to put on your expense account.
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming licence denial...
Bullshit!
...Rothstein followed several... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
You have a past.
I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.
You guys think you have the right to pass judgement!
NEWSREADER:
Long suspected of running Tangiers without a licence... yesterday's hearing was to determine if someone with Rothstein's history... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.
REMO:
Fucking hypocrites!
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.
What's he doing?
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
Maybe he could run things with another job title.
Won't be the best, but what are we gonna do?
REMO:
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.
Let him hide upstairs in the office.
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.
But please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.
ANNOUNCER: [On TV] Ladies and gentlemen... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new...
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.
Tonight, taped live from the all-new sports book... we present the premiere showing of Aces High... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... and the Sam Rothstein dancers!
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best U.S. Football handicapper.
A man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.
Now, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...
Mr. Sam Rothstein.
[Audience applauding]
[Band playing upbeat dance music]
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein show.
We're happy to have you here this evening.
The young lady to my left is Trudy... who is a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.
Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon.
PAT:
Keep an eye on him.
FRANKIE:
I've got a large family.
SAM:
How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say, eight children.
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.
[Audience laughing]
PHILIP:
Ace, don't do it.
Jesus.
He's juggling!
SAM:
Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.
You can ask me anything you want.
ANDY:
What the hell is he doing on television?
He's on all night, screaming about taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?
He's out of his fucking mind.
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.
Other people have to pay through the nose.
Such is life.
Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.
SAM:
First, what they did was totally unconstitutional.
SAM:
We're on the list to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.
These guys don't care about the Supreme Court.
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.
Not only should you quit, you should run.
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.
How the fuck does that help?
The heat he brought down is murder.
The police department was cooperative.
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.
What do you do about that?
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?
- They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
- Lf he took a break... it would give everybody time to manoeuvre.
I would forget about the manoeuvre.
I would just get out.
[Sighs]
I can't do that.
SAM:
Of course, as soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.
I've got to do some shopping.
Want to go?
SAM:
Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.
On routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
GINGER:
I got a sprained fucking elbow.
Meet me at 3:00.
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards further down the road.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Just be there.
Suzy Cream Cheese has the same outfit.
GINGER:
I saw something.
Something very cute.
AGENT:
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant.
Brown unit.
He's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.
SAM:
Nicky started out before me... because it wasn't that easy for him to get around anymore.
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars... at least six times before he could shake all his tails.
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.
[Upbeat rock music]
SAM:
Meeting in the desert always made me nervous.
It's a scary place.
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.
Normally, my prospects of coming back alive... from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...
I gave myself 50-50.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
Where the fuck you get off talking to people behind my back?
- What people?
- Did you think I wouldn't find out?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
You said I'm bringing heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of you?
You're ordering me out?
You better get your own fucking army!
I didn't order you or anybody.
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.
You want me to get out of my own fucking town?
Yeah, let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.
You know that you only have your fucking casino because I made that possible!
I'm what counts out here.
Not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.
And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?
I get calls from back home every day.
They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.
You could've had the food-and-beverage job without going on TV!
- You wanted to go on TV.
- Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.
I'm known.
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.
You brought down so much heat on me.
Every time I meet somebody, they ask me if I know you.
Sure, now you wanna blame your fucking licence on me.
When you asked me if you could come out here... what did I tell you?
I knew you'd come out no matter what I said.
Do you remember?
Back up a fucking minute here.
One minute.
I asked you?
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?
NICKY:
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker!
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!
Without me, you personally...
Every fucking wise guy still around will take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!
Then where you gonna go?
You're fucking warned.
Don't go over my fucking head again, you motherfucker, you!
[Rhythmic pop music]
Well, we got company.
Did you see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.
Grew up together, and he acts like he doesn't know me.
I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but there's ways to do things.
Fuck him.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Forget about it.
Don't let it bother you.
Does it look like it's bothering me?
Why do I give a fuck?
Oscar, too.
All the money I gave him, that prick.
He didn't even look over.
What's his fucking problem?
- Fucking Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're having a good time.
So are we.
[Phone ringing]
Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?
BILLY:
The little guy.
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.
We turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was.
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about $10,000.
Now he's really pissed.
- He wants a $50,000 marker.
- Just give him $10,000.
That's it.
I'll be right down.
He's gonna come up with $10,000 just the way you want.
No, I said fucking $50,000!
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where you get it.
Fuckers.
They take it but don't wanna give it back.
[Upbeat rock music]
How the fuck can you grin?
You know how much I'm stuck?
Do you give a fuck?
Give yourself a hand, right across your fucking mouth.
Look at this beaut they put in now.
NICKY:
Sherbert send you in here to rob me now?
Been fucking knocking everybody's dick in all night?
Been beating the customers?
Jag-off.
Hit me.
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass.
Hit me again.
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.
Hit me again.
Keep looking at him.
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.
Hit me again!
What the fuck you keep looking at him for?
You fucking...
Look at this, 20 paints in a row.
Hit me again.
NICKY:
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
- You gotta get out of here.
- Tell this motherfucker to pay that marker.
You're not listening.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.
- Just give me the money.
- I'm gonna okay you $10,000, that's it.
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.
$10,000 and that's it.
What are you staring at, you bald-headed Jew prick?
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!
NICKY:
Get out of here?
I got a marker coming.
Deal.
I know, but everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.
I just want what any divorced woman would get.
She's only sober about two hours a day.
It's usually from 11:00 a.m. To 1:00 p.m.
If I gave her her money and her jewels, she's gonna piss it all away in a year.
Where would you be then?
Coming right back to me... or finding some other excuse to come...
We had a deal.
Remember that?
He said if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things and leave.
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.
SAM:
You know me.
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let... someone in your condition take my child away from me?
Do you?
You know that won't happen.
SAM:
And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...
I could never reach her.
I could never make her love me.
I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life, a home, a kid.
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.
Everything all right?
SAM:
What could we do?
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.
Little separations.
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.
She was gonna spend a week shopping.
OPERATOR:
Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
The Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills.
RECEPTIONIST:
Hello, Beverly Hotel.
SAM:
Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
RECEPTIONIST:
Sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?
RECEPTIONIST:
Yes, they both checked out.
SAM:
Thank you.
[Phone ringing]
Hello.
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.
Some lowlife named Lester Diamond.
My daughter's with them.
They're gonna try and kidnap her.
SAM:
Is there anybody you can send?
MAN:
We'll take care of it.
[Doorbell rings]
We got a number and an address.
SAM:
Hello.
Is this Lester?
Who's calling?
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.
She's not here, Sam.
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.
SAM:
I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.
LESTER:
I wouldn't.
You shouldn't do this.
SAM:
You understand?
Put her on the fucking phone.
Sam, I don't know where she is.
LESTER:
So, listen, can I call you back in a few minutes?
SAM: 702-472-1862.
LESTER:
I'll call back.
SAM:
Right away.
- Right back.
- You got it.
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.
LESTER:
You want to get back at this prick?
LESTER:
You got what, $2 million in that box?
You got a minute?
He's got $2 million in the box, right?
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash... and the only other thing he cares about.
Her majesty.
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.
You dye your hair.
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?
AMY:
I don't want to go to Europe.
LESTER:
Shut your mouth.
AMY:
You shut up.
LESTER:
Want me to come over?
LESTER:
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.
- Lester, he called you here.
- Right.
Ace was on the phone.
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.
That means he's sending some guys over here now.
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell...
GINGER:
Yeah, he's sitting by the phone waiting for you to call him back!
What are we gonna do?
He's probably got guys outside the fucking house!
- It's this fucking bullshit of yours!
- Get your bag!
Let's go!
- What bullshit?
You want to talk it over?
- Are you done yakking?
Go!
Get in the car!
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.
GINGER:
I think he's gonna kill me.
NICKY:
Relax.
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back in an hour at this number...
- and you'll be there, right?
- I'll be here.
Listen, don't do anything else crazy.
You all right?
Okay, bye.
GINGER:
Knock it off.
LESTER:
She started it.
She started the whole thing.
- Don't even think you're gonna drive.
- I'm gonna drive.
SAM:
I'm not gonna drive with a crazy woman.
You're driving me nuts!
Get on the passenger side!
I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!
Can we...
[Pop music plays loudly on radio]
Ginger called me.
Yeah?
NICKY:
I just told you she called me.
SAM:
What'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
She's with that cocksucker again.
They got Amy.
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?
I know.
Why didn't you come to me?
This is family.
It ain't business.
Meanwhile, you made calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.
Back and forth, this one and that one.
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?
What am I going to do with this woman?
SAM:
Driving me fucking crazy.
NICKY:
I think if you... assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Driving me fucking crazy.
NICKY:
Once you get her here, think about it.
Wait till you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.
That's the main thing here.
You want your kid, don't you?
[Phone rings]
SAM:
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.
Just, please, put Amy on a plane to get her here right away.
SAM:
That's all I'm asking.
GINGER:
Do you...
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is...
Do you think if I came back...
Do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I understand that.
I know I fucked up.
- What about the money?
Where's the box?
- I gotta tell you...
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.
SAM:
What's it under?
GINGER:
Pretty serious.
SAM:
How serious?
GINGER:
It's under $25,000.
SAM:
It's under $25,000?
GINGER:
Yeah.
SAM:
The $2 million is still there?
GINGER:
Yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.
He got his $25,000.
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.
Hi, Sam.
So what'd you do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
$25,000 for clothes?
He wanted a watch, too.
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?
GINO:
Good evening, signora.
This way.
SAM:
The good part was I had Amy back.
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.
I tried to keep things nice and civil... but $25,000 for three suits?
That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.
Let's say he did, which he won't.
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch, too.
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice... he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000 at the most, which is impossible for him.
Plus, at the most, three suits, $1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?
- Around $10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?
SAM:
I'm just trying to figure it out.
GINGER:
There's nothing to figure out.
I'm home.
We're working it out.
But I've been told before, "We're working it out."
You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favour to me?
Counting the watch, let's say another $4,000 for expenses this weekend... of which you must have had a good time.
I know he did.
That's for sure.
I know that fucking piece of shit had a good fucking time.
On my money.
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.
You're looking at me a certain way.
You're teary-eyed.
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?
Good fucking actress.
SAM:
You can fucking get pity out of people.
I'm not a john.
You understand?
You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.
That fucking pimp cocksucker.
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.
SAM:
Lucky he's fucking living.
If you would have stayed with Amy... and you had run away, he would have been dead.
Both of you.
Dead.
Dead.
GINGER:
No, it isn't fair.
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fucking deal?
I go...
Listen, I just can't fucking take it.
Why should I fucking take it?
That wasn't the deal.
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fucking past.
He'll never let me live it down.
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.
GINGER:
I want him killed.
I've had it.
So are you with me on this?
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.
SAM:
Hello.
GINGER:
Yes, I do!
GINGER:
I fucking hate you!
I can't take it anymore!
Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fucking guts!
SAM:
You hate my guts?
I want you to come with me now!
SAM:
I want you out of here!
Take your fucking bag and get out of here!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
- You'll get your money!
Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.
SAM:
No kidding!
GINGER:
And I still get my money.
I need some cash now!
You can't just put me in the street!
You've never been straight with me ever since I met you!
You never even loved me in the first place!
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you bitch!
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
SAM:
You're lower than a dog!
GINGER:
Fuck you!
Here!
Is this enough money?
Will it last you two fucking days?
Take it!
Greedy bitch.
Take the fucking money.
I'm going to the bank...
- and I'm getting my jewellery, too!
- It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.
GINGER:
I'm taking Amy.
SAM:
You're not.
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.
SAM:
You're stoned.
You're a junkie.
Get out of here.
I am not!
She's my daughter, too!
SAM:
Send my lawyers a letter, god-fucking-damn you!
GINGER:
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cut me out of my end!
GINGER:
Fucker!
[Car engine stops]
[Car door closes]
[Approaching footsteps]
SAM:
The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.
Later, I realised I didn't want to give her the money because if I did...
I knew I'd never see her again.
Have a good day at school, okay?
Okay, angel.
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.
SAM:
Here's a beeper.
I want you to keep it on you.
It's very light.
SAM:
So I can call you whenever I have to.
Okay?
NICKY:
What are you supposed to do?
What do you wanna do?
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.
Two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it...
It's not my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.
You're right.
I know.
- I was just...
- What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
Yeah?
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank... who could help me get my jewellery out?
There's a lot of money in there.
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You know he's never gonna give me my jewellery.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You're right.
That's Sammy.
And he's probably got it there, too.
He's so fucking lucky.
I could have buried him.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
No, he wouldn't.
I would have.
- He'd have been right, too.
Seriously.
- Come on.
You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I didn't.
I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.
You did.
You're right.
I like that.
- That's what I like, you did the right thing.
- I did what you told me to.
- Yes, you did.
- You always tell me the right thing to do.
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.
Changed.
- He did.
He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.
He hates me.
He hates my fucking guts.
Come on, you're a toughie.
You can take this.
NICKY:
Don't cry.
GINGER:
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help.
I need some help.
You gotta help me.
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I do.
I need a new sponsor.
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.
I'll take care of you.
GINGER:
Thank you.
NICKY:
It's what you want, isn't it?
[Sentimental RB music]
MAN:
That's Ace's wife.
MAN 2:
This is great for the boss.
[Approaching car]
[Door banging]
GINGER:
Hi.
SAM:
Hi.
SAM:
You didn't answer your beeper.
GINGER:
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I tried to do it.
I know that you want me to, but...
I'm driving down the freeway and the fucking thing beeps.
GINGER:
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?
SAM:
I put her to bed.
GINGER:
I got your cigarettes.
GINGER:
Oscar wants you to call him.
SAM:
So who'd you go to lunch with?
GINGER:
Jennifer.
SAM:
Where'd you go?
GINGER:
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
GINGER:
I had a salad.
SAM:
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay.
I want you to call Jennifer... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why I want to do it.
- Just do it.
- Fine.
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.
JENNIFER:
Hello?
SAM:
Hello, Jennifer.
It's Sam.
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not that.
SAM:
I knew she fucked around.
Yeah, she did what she did, and I did what I had to do, but...
Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.
What if he won't stop?
SAM:
It could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
SAM:
She was very convincing when she wanted to be.
And this is how she backed him off.
[Both panting]
Hey, Ginger.
Don't forget, if you're challenged... if he asks anything, deny everything.
You understand?
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.
That could really cause a serious problem.
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?
You hear what I'm saying, right?
I know.
You don't have to tell me that.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do I think you're stupid?
No.
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.
SAM:
By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets... that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.
It got to the point, when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.
REMO:
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private.
But I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie, the little guy... he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?
Because if he is, it's a problem.
FRANK:
What could I say?
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up getting killed.
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.
It's bad for business.
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...
I could wind up getting killed, too.
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.
I know.
That's why I'm asking.
You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.
- He's good, he's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.
- Do it for me.
- No problem.
You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardising anything for our friends.
You understand?
- I understand.
- Okay.
Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.
SAM:
By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.
Vegas really got to him.
The booze, the coke, the broads.
I mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.
FRANK:
You must've drank too much.
NICKY:
Fuck yourself.
SAM:
One night, he had to belt a guy three times... before the guy finally went down.
In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot.
You add this into the mix...
Maybe Vegas got to all of us.
His crew followed him right over the edge.
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.
- What do you guys want?
- Police!
Stay in the car!
SAM:
He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.
COP:
Drop the gun!
BLUE:
Fuck you!
SAM:
The cops shot Blue... because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.
They could have been right, but who knows?
COP:
Jesus Christ!
What gun?
He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.
COP 2:
What do you want?
It's pitch black.
COP 2:
It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!
COP:
You moron!
COP:
I'll be doing paperwork for two months!
COP 2:
What'll we do?
COP 2:
Sorry!
COP:
You jerk-off!
SAM:
To make matters worse... to get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night... and started shooting up the cops' houses.
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore... because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths... because the Feds brought in lip readers.
Nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money.
FRANK:
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
NICKY:
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?
FRANK:
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
NICKY:
What'd you tell him?
FRANK:
I told him I didn't know nothing.
FRANK:
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
NICKY:
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?
FRANK:
No, you would have heard something.
NICKY:
What's to stop him?
FRANK:
I know.
NICKY:
I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.
FRANK:
But they keep asking about it.
NICKY:
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.
NICKY:
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a war or something.
NICKY:
I'm not sure yet.
But you know what I want you to do?
NICKY:
Who's this guy?
FRANK:
That ain't nobody.
NICKY:
You know what I want you to do?
NICKY:
Get some guys to dig a hole in the desert and show you where it's at.
FRANK:
Angelo and Buster.
NICKY:
I'm not sure yet.
FRANK:
They'll do it.
NICKY:
When I'm ready, I'll say the words:
"Go see the Jew." And you make it disappear.
Know what I mean?
FRANK:
Let me know.
But you gotta be ready.
FRANK:
You know what I'm talking about?
NICKY:
Did I say to do anything yet?
NICKY:
I said I'm not sure.
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
NICKY:
Where are these pricks at?
They're in the motel?
FRANK:
There or in the fucking bank.
I don't know.
All over the joint.
[Loud dance music]
[Phone ringing]
[Phone continues ringing]
I'll be right back.
Any calls for me, give them to Mr. Sherbert.
- Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
- I'm going home for a few seconds.
He's on his way home.
Okay.
Hello?
Ginger?
AMY:
Help, Daddy!
SAM:
Amy!
SAM:
Amy, open the door!
AMY:
I can't!
I'm tied!
[Amy screams]
AMY:
Dad!
SAM:
What happened?
SAM:
Who did this to you?
AMY:
Mummy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose.
AMY:
No, please!
SAM:
Okay, I'm gonna be right back.
SAM:
When did this happen, honey?
AMY:
I don't know.
What time did your mother do this?
When did she leave?
AMY:
I don't know.
[Amy moans]
[Phone ringing]
SAM:
Hello?
NICKY:
Sammy.
SAM:
Yeah.
Who's this?
NICKY:
Me.
NICKY:
You okay?
SAM:
No, I'm not okay.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.
Ginger's missing.
She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.
I don't know where she is.
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?
NICKY:
Yeah, she's here.
SAM:
I'll be right over.
All right.
- Coming over.
- Great.
[Brakes squealing]
Don't make a scene, all right?
I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She's trying to save your marriage.
Nicky, I want to talk to that fucking bitch.
Be fucking nice.
Calm.
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.
[Sentimental jazz music]
GINGER:
Hi.
SAM:
Are you out of your mind?
You tie up our kid and lock the door?
Are you out of your mind?
That's our child.
Are you out of your mind?
It was just for a little while.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to have you committed.
You do that again and I'll...
I was just gonna be out for a little while.
She was asleep.
I was gonna be back...
SAM:
Listen.
...before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fucking cunt... let me tell you something.
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
You ever touch her again or do anything like that again...
I'll fucking kill you, pure and simple.
SAM:
You hear me?
Pure and simple.
GINGER:
Why don't you let me go?
SAM:
I'll kill you.
SAM:
You fucking whore.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign.
I just want the key to my jewellery, and you to let me go.
SAM:
Want your jewellery?
GINGER:
Let me go.
And let you disgrace me, you pig?
SAM:
Get up and be a mother.
Get in the car and go home right now.
Get up and get in...
- Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get up!
Are you threatening me?
I'll fucking kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.
I'm going!
Now you need approval from him to go home?
So what?
Who blew you in the parking lot before you came in?
You make me sick, you fuck.
- Once a hooker, always a hooker.
- Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
Fuck you!
[Upbeat pop music]
Billy Sherbert, please.
Put him on.
BILLY:
Who's this?
SAM:
Listen, I'll explain later.
You got a gun at home?
Bring it over right away.
- Take it easy.
I'll do it.
- Okay.
Leave it where it is!
Where is he?
I want that Jew bastard killed!
Hide her car in the back.
GINGER:
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!
Supposing he goes back home and makes a fucking beef?
- I gotta know exactly what you said.
Tell me.
- Me?
Nothing.
I said...
I said, no.
Everything he said, I just kept saying no.
I told you this was fucking dangerous.
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."
If it's so fucking dangerous, why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a fucking smart-ass!
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna whack him for you?
NICKY:
Motherfucker.
- I knew it.
- What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?
You think he'll give you money?
Are you out of your mind?
- Look what you did to this guy.
- What?
If you'd just kept your fucking mouth shut.
What's the use!
I should have never got involved...
[Ginger screaming hysterically]
Hey!
You motherfucker, you!
GINGER:
You fucker!
NICKY:
Get the fuck out!
[Ginger crying]
NICKY:
Get the fuck out!
GINGER:
No!
NICKY:
Get down there!
Take it easy!
NICKY:
I shouldn't have gotten involved with this nut!
FRANK:
You'll kill her.
Take it easy.
NICKY:
Get her out of here.
FRANK:
Let's go.
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!
I'm going to the FBI!
I'm not scared anymore!
NICKY:
All right.
Be careful.
GINGER:
You've fucked with me for the last time!
Okay.
Yeah.
NICKY:
Careful.
Come on.
Get inside.
Look at this.
Motherfucker.
[Frank sighs]
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.
I should never have started with this fucking broad.
Take it easy.
What could you do?
FRANK:
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
I'm in a bad fucking spot here.
You know that?
A bad fucking spot.
[Rhythmic pop music]
SAM:
I left the kid with neighbours.
I had $1 million in cash and jewels... that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel.
Put this in the hotel safe and I want you to come back.
She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...
SAM:
Just wait there for me.
GINGER:
Get down here and talk to me!
You can't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker!
GINGER:
I mean it!
Come down here right now!
GINGER:
Get down here and talk to me, God damn it!
GINGER:
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!
GINGER:
I'm going to drive this fucking car through the living room!
GINGER:
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!
GINGER:
Come out here and talk to me.
SAM:
Will you stop it?
SAM:
You're drunk.
You're on drugs.
GINGER:
I am not!
- You'll be sorry if you don't stop.
- Don't you threaten me!
GINGER:
You're not threatening me anymore!
You fuck!
I'm sick of you!
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
He's my new sponsor!
How about that, you fuckhead!
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!
GINGER:
I don't have to take your shit anymore!
I'm going to the FBI!
I'll go to the police!
- I am not protecting you anymore!
- Mrs. Rothstein...
GINGER:
He won't let me inside!
Mr. Rothstein, we've been getting some complaints about the noise.
I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.
I won't let her in.
I'm sorry, Randy.
I won't, the way she's behaving.
GINGER:
Won't let me in?
SAM:
Who knows what you'll do there.
I've been in the same clothes for two days!
- I want to get my things!
Big deal!
- Okay.
Let her in to get a few things.
That way she'll leave.
COP:
This is half her house.
SAM:
I'm afraid.
GINGER:
You aren't afraid!
SAM:
She'll destroy stuff.
- Let me in the house!
- Hey!
- Fucker!
- Hold on!
Please!
GINGER:
You should be afraid, the way you treat me!
Lt'll make it easier on everybody.
COP:
If we let her get her things, we'll be out of your hair.
If she calms down, I'll let her in.
GINGER:
I am calm!
SAM:
If she calms down...
I will let her in for five minutes... if you gentlemen will escort her out if she won't leave.
- Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes.
Fine!
Fuck you!
GINGER:
You wouldn't believe how mean he is.
He's locked up my papers.
I have to get them.
Don't let him come up here... because I know they're in here in the desk.
Fuck.
GINGER:
Pay attention.
He could come up here at anytime.
Are you watching for him?
GINGER:
Got them.
I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
It'll just be a couple minutes.
We got other things to do, too.
He'll hurry her up.
- How's everything else?
- Fine.
- How's your family?
- Not bad.
In fact, my wife's pregnant again.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
We're happy about that.
I just have to get this one more thing, then we can go.
GINGER:
Shit!
Fuck!
GINGER:
Shit!
God!
GINGER:
That pisses me off!
Don't worry.
It would be great... if you could follow me out of here... because he's been threatening me!
Take care.
Thank you.
[Crying] I can't believe this.
GINGER:
I just need to pick up a little cash.
Could you come with me?
SAM:
You've got to stop her.
CHARLIE:
I'm sorry, Sam.
CHARLIE:
What can I do?
SAM:
She's a junkie.
She's out of her mind!
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.
There's nothing I can do.
I'd like to help...
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take it.
SAM:
She can't.
Half of it is mine.
CHARLIE:
Listen to me.
CHARLIE:
There's nothing I can do.
SAM:
I'm coming down.
Shit!
God damn it!
I'll need a bag.
Could you ask the guy for the big bag?
COP:
Go get a bag, man.
GINGER:
Here.
- Lady, I can't take it.
- You can.
You've been so nice to me.
GINGER:
Yes, just hold the top open.
All right?
And I can...
Oh, God!
It's him.
You have to stop him.
'Cause he said he was gonna kill me.
COP:
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.
COP:
Hold on a second.
SAM:
She's driving away.
COP:
There's nothing we can do.
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look.
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.
COP:
Nothing we can do.
She had the key.
COP 2:
She's on the account.
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station.
- Okay.
Let's do it.
[Siren wailing]
- We're placing you under arrest.
- For what?
- For aiding and abetting...
- For what?
- For aiding and abetting...
- I'm just trying to leave.
SAM:
After all the threats and bullshit... it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.
But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
They had all the pieces they needed.
But I didn't do anything.
SAM:
Everyone began to tumble, like dominoes.
FBI!
We have a warrant!
SAM:
Between Piscano complaining on the wire... between Nicky, Ginger, me and my licence... paradise.
We managed to really fuck it up.
NICKY JR:
Mum.
JENNIFER:
Someone's at the door now.
FBI.
We have a federal search warrant.
NICKY:
I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?
- I'm Mark Casper, FBI.
- Yeah?
Can I make a fucking phone call?
Yes, but you don't have to talk to us like that.
FBI AGENT:
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.
NICKY:
They got almost everybody else.
FBI AGENT:
This area is seized!
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized.
FBI AGENT:
Put every box on the table.
[Rhythmic jazz music]
Yes.
Here we are.
Little craps figures.
SAM:
Green?
Don't even ask.
...$30,000 of yours.
- No.
That's why it wasn't valid.
I was being extorted.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
PHILIP:
I've got nothing to hide.
NICKY:
Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.
Oh, this is good.
NICKY:
He might as well give them a blueprint.
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.
NICKY:
What a fucking balloon head.
ARTIE:
What are you doing?
AGENT:
Take it easy.
WIFE:
Wait!
WIFE:
Wait!
He's sick!
COP:
Move back.
WIFE:
It's his heart!
Is he breathing?
COP 2:
CPR now!
SAM:
Artie got so upset he had a heart attack... and dropped dead right in front of his wife.
- Calm down!
- No, I won't calm down!
- He's my husband!
Artie!
- We can't help him if...
SAM:
At the end of the day... they finally came to see me with the pictures.
FBI AGENT:
Why protect a friend who betrayed you?
SAM:
But I didn't want to look at them... or the guys who brought them.
COUNSELLOR:
Your Honour, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm.
COUNSELLOR:
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.
NICKY:
When they were arrested, some were so old... they needed doctors at their arraignment.
COUNSELLOR:
Pre-trial services recommends that bail remain as set.
JUDGE:
Take recess.
NICKY:
When it looked like they'd get... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming a casino... sick or no fucking sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.
So the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse.
When something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out.
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.
Stand-up guy just like his old man.
That's the way I see it.
I agree.
He's solid.
He's a fucking Marine.
He's okay.
He always was.
What do you think?
Look, why take a chance?
At least that's the way I feel about it.
ANDY:
Call Artie.
Tell him I don't care what... he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning.
It's done.
It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation with him.
[Gunshots muffled by silencer]
NICKY:
As much as they liked him, he wasn't one of us.
He wasn't Italian.
As far as they knew, he could have talked.
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.
He thought nobody would find him there.
[Gunshots muffled by silencer]
[Breaking glass]
[Gunshots muffled by silencer]
NICKY:
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.
So naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding... just to save his kid and give them all up.
So...
Where you going, jag-off?
NICKY:
But, anyway, they all had to follow.
Everybody went down.
Fuck you.
NICKY:
Before you knew it... anybody who knew anything wound up getting whacked.
GINGER:
Oh, no!
No!
SAM:
After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies, and bikers in L.A.
In a few months, they went through all the money and jewels.
[Lntense rock music]
After they found her body...
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.
He said they gave her a hot dose.
In the end, all she had left was $3,600 in mint condition coins.
[Lntense rock music continues]
No matter what the Feds or the papers said about my car bombing... it was amateur night, you could tell.
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew... was that, that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.
It's the only thing that saved my life.
The bombing was never authorised, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
So did the powers that be.
NICKY:
How are you?
BOSS:
How you doing?
NICKY:
It took months for everything to calm down.
But finally, my guys got out on bail.
The bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always the fucking dollars.
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around.
What's right is right.
They don't give a fuck about...
THUG:
Holy fucking...
NICKY:
What the fuck...
Come on, motherfucker!
Tough guys!
You and your fucking brother!
You fucking scumbags!
No more!
- Frankie!
- No more!
You see?
Watch!
NICKY:
Frankie!
You piece of shit!
FRANK:
Fuck you!
NICKY:
Fucking punk!
Piece of shit!
No!
Take this motherfucker out!
[Dominick groaning]
Leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.
Frankie.
FRANK:
All right.
Strip him.
NICKY:
No balls.
You got no fucking balls.
Oh, Dominick!
NICKY:
Dominick.
[Nicky weeping]
FRANK:
Come on.
THUG:
Bury them?
FRANK:
Bury them.
[Nicky moaning]
SAM:
The word was out.
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.
How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him and his brother.
They buried them while they were still breathing.
MAN:
You all right?
Watch out!
MAN:
Mister, you all right?
SAM:
Yeah.
SAM:
They had other ideas for me.
[Sirens wailing]
MEDIC:
We need some help over here!
MEDIC 2:
You sure are lucky, mister.
[Dramatic operatic music]
SAM:
The town will never be the same.
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.
Today it looks like Disneyland.
While the kids play cardboard pirates...
Mummy and Daddy drop the house payments and junior's college money... on the poker slots.
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checking into an airport.
If you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.
Today it's all gone.
A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid will want his Social Security number.
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.
And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids?
Junk bonds.
SAM:
Still not sure?
SAM:
Probable.
Maybe questionable.
SAM:
All right, let me know as soon as you can find out.
SAM:
In the end, I wound up right back where I started.
I could still pick winners... and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing?
And that's that!
[Nostalgic instrumental music]
Here we are in the 12th and final round.
It's been a brutal fight between xao and the world champion chance o'brien.
They're having a chance to fight with one another that has escalated this battle into a war.
Xao has cyber enhancements that seem to give him the strength to stay with o'brien, who is one of the few 100% human fighters still competing.
O'brien has the speed, power and skill well beyond any current fighter of any grade, cyber-enhanced or human.
Down!
Down!
This could be it!
The electronic timer counts away the seconds!
Eight, nine, 10!
Chance o'brien has reclaimed his championship with a stunning twelfth-round knockout of previously unbeaten xao.
O'brien's unorthodox manager,
Jo, has leaped into the ring to congratulate her fighter.
What will the rematch be like?
It is a crucial time for our company.
Competition with other corporations is disrupting our market share.
We have gone from 53% to 39% in two years.
The zikan corporation alone has penetrated 10% into our coverage in the last eight months.
And the public knows it.
You gentlemen have allowed it to happen.
Mr. tung, as head of the marketing division, what do you propose?
We need to demonstrate the superiority of our bioengineered implants in a vivid, spectacular fashion, which means we need to pit our cyber enhancements against all the others in direct competition on a world stage for all to see.
It would be the media event of all time.
All very noble, Mr. tung, but how is such a goal attained?
We sponsor a fighting tournament where all the greatest fighters in the world are invited.
Each corporation will bioenhance a combatant of their choice.
The best cyber technology wins.
Simple!
It would be the super bowl, world cup, and Olympics rolled up in one multimedia mega-event.
Think of the marketing bonanza.
This is a crazy dream.
No corporation is going to sponsor an event where people could be killed.
Just last week a football player was paralyzed, and in a speed car race two drivers were burned to death.
It's part of the public lure.
The public doesn't hold the sponsor responsible, unless of course the entertainment is of poor quality.
It's ridiculous.
Each journey begins with a single step.
The tournament may be that step higher, but it is crucial that the step be in the right direction.
You're confident you do have a man who can win this tournament?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Gentlemen, this is xao.
He has agreed to be our representative in the tournament.
The one who lost the bout to a pure human, an American.
That was before some changes were made.
Two current full-contact champions.
Each man gets 10 million euro-credits if they can defeat our champion.
Oh, my God!
As you can see, he's not the same fighter or man he was six months ago.
I don't think the word "man" even applies.
Isn't there a rule that fighters must be at least 90% human?
This is our tournament on our private island outside the jurisdiction of any country.
We'll increase the allowance of cyber implants to 50%.
After all, the reason for the tournament is to demonstrate the superiority of biomechanical systems over human tissue, right?
Right.
Now what if a pure human wants to compete?
The tournament is completely open to all,
- even pure humans.
- Even the American.
Chance o'brien is considered the greatest champion ever.
It is our intention to have him compete in the tournament.
But can xao beat him?
We'll make sure he does.
We will let you take this step, Mr. tung.
But remember, xao's fate and yours are one and the same.
Oh, my!
We've got another great fight.
The world's number-one ranked challenger is giving the champion, chance o'brien, all he can handle.
Raul comes to this fight with an impressive 29 and 1 record, the lone loss coming early in his career before he had his cyber implants.
O'brien has seemed sluggish so far.
His mind doesn't seem focused on the fight.
His showboating and sluggish performance thus far has not pleased his manager, Jo.
Raul could build up enough points in the computer scoring that could endanger o'brien's hold on the world title he has held for three years.
Oh, boy!
There's a little of o'brien's power.
Stop fooling around!
But Raul comes right back!
And there's the bell ending the round.
What the hell are you doing out there?
That ought to have a tag on his toe by now.
- Hey, you want to give it a try?
- Knock it off!
You're defending your title.
Now get out there and fight like it.
- Will you marry me?
- What?
Will you marry me?
You're asking me now?
Yeah.
I mean, we can stay here.
I tell you what, champ.
I'll marry whoever wins this bout.
There seems to be a heated discussion in the champion's corner.
Jo has got to have told o'brien that he is on the verge of losing his title.
Let's see if it's had any effect on o'brien's coming out strong.
He's going right to a flying kick!
Raul's going down!
The real champ o'brien seems to have shown up.
Yeah!
Hey, Raul, you know who Jo is, don't you?
Yeah, your trainer?
Yeah, she's right over there.
- Why don't you take a look?
- What?
Go ahead, take a look.
I'm not going to hit you.
Wait, o'brien and Raul seem to be having some kind of discussion out in the middle of the ring.
What in the hell?
Sweet girl.
Well, she said she'll marry whoever wins this.
Really?
Maybe I'd better go rent a tux.
The conversation seems directed
- at o'brien's manager, Jo.
- What's going on?
I can't quite hear what they're saying.
But here we go.
The fighters seem ready to fight again.
Honeymoon in Hawaii?
Yeah, how about a cold day in hell?
Really?
Okay, come on!
Come on, chance!
Yeah!
There you go, baby!
Oh, golly!
What a kick!
That's lights out for Raul.
Chance o'brien successfully defends his championship for the eleventh time.
He has staked his claim as the greatest fighter in the world today.
All right, baby!
Chance!
Chance!
Who do you fight next?
Actually, my next fight is with my trainer here about where we're going on our honeymoon.
A fight against the heavyweight champion astasio would be fantastic.
Not for astasio.
What about the tournament held by the sianon corporation?
What about it?
Well, as the greatest human fighter in the world, do you intend to test your fighting skills against the world's foremost cyborgs?
Mr. o'brien is not interested in proving himself to a bunch of robots and used car parts.
Xao will be competing.
You owe him a rematch.
Or are you afraid that your win was just human luck?
I'll tell you what, Mr...
You know my name.
Tung.
Tung.
If you give me the 60 million you're offering in platinum,
I'll show you some luck.
It's yours, if you earn it.
We're not interested.
Chance o'brien is a legitimate world champion.
He doesn't have to fight in your bloodfest.
So Mr. o'brien is afraid of xao.
Not afraid.
He'd rip his implants off and shove them up his synthetic ass.
Like she says, we're not interested.
It's getting late, and if anyone doesn't have an intelligent question, we'll call it a night.
Thanks a lot, everyone.
Sorry if these clowns ruined it for you.
I expect you all to be there.
So now that you're not in such a weakened state, still want to marry me?
Honey, when you're around,
I'm always in a weakened state.
- I'm serious.
- So am I.
Well, if you put it that way, how can I say no?
Well, you could try.
But I'm tougher than you are.
Come on, Mrs. o'brien, I'll buy you some breakfast.
Sounds great.
Ah, I love Rome.
It's so romantic.
It's like an old movie or something.
Let's get married here in the spring.
It would be great to do it with 60 mill in platinum.
We don't need the money.
You know he's jacked up more.
It's past the limit, but I bet I could still beat him.
I'm not going to let you go.
Why?
Jo, if I win this, I never have to fight again.
If you lose, I'll never have a chance to say I do.
You think I can't win.
No.
It's not about winning, chance.
It's not even about competition.
It's sales and market shares and profits.
It's not you or me.
What?
I love you.
- You have no idea.
- No.
I'm going to prove it to you.
With this ring, I thee wed.
And with this whistle, I thee wed.
Hey!
You're so good.
Looks like my clowns spoiled your fun again, huh?
Come on.
You should have accepted our invitation.
The publicity would have been great for both of us.
Well, since you won't do it for money, maybe you'll do it for love.
See you at the fights, Mr. o'brienski.
Mr. o'brien, the world champion.
We've been expecting you.
I'm a big fan of yours myself.
Where is this tournament being held?
Iridoken island, and you're scheduled
- to register tomorrow.
- Thanks.
We're going to break this boy down.
You shouldn't be here by yourself.
Lots of bad people here.
Hey, look, I need to take these shoes.
I promise I'll come back and I'll pay you later.
I promise.
I promise.
Anybody knows where the docks are?
The docks.
Hey, does anyone know where the docks are?
Does anybody know where the boats come in?
Huh?
Hey!
Hey!
Do you guys know where the docks are?
- The docks.
- Docks?
The docks!
The docks, where the boats come in.
Ah, docks.
Yeah.
- Over there.
- That way.
- That way.
- No, no.
That way.
Whoa!
Hey!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Hey, wait up!
Hey, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Cover your human ass, man!
Chance o'brien.
No, that's okay.
I don't want to know somebody
I might have to kill.
Lance stovich.

You may as well go home now.

You don't have a chance.
Put your hand over there.

Okay, step over there.
Go home!

Percentage of molecular mutations--
Step over there.
Thank you.
How do you like those synthetic heatseekers?
Hey, sorry about the car.
Forget it.
You always go jogging in the nude?
I was mugged.
You're from the zanik corporation.
It's big-time bio shit, huh?
Yeah, 13th largest.
I can honestly say they made me the man I am today.
I get three million just to show up and show off.
Who's sponsoring you?
The bad guys.
- Huh?
- Forget it.
So you see any of the sianon corporation around?
Not yet.
Hey, you hungry?
I've got this great corporate expense account.
Come on, let's go get something to eat.
Come on.
Hey, thanks for that.
A word from the sianon corporation.
Are you tired of looking like a 98-pound weakling but are too lazy to do anything about it?
Well, welcome to sianon's 21st-century miracle.
No diets and no workouts.
The sianon corporation's new cyber implants will have you looking the way you want.
You can do it quickly and safely, with just some minor discomfort.
In just three days' time, sianon guarantees to give you the body and face you've always wanted, rebuilt with cyber-enhanced implants into a more powerful you.
So do you really want to look like this when in three days you could look like this?
A safer, better-looking cyber future from the sianon corporation.
You know where xao is staying?
That's top secret.
All the corporations have taken a lot of security to protect their products
- from any tampering.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, where is all your security?
You're looking at the chairman of the board.
I can do what I want.
For all the money we were going to spend on a fighter,
I just figured I'd do it myself.
Yeah, well, you may find the ring a little tougher than the boardroom.
I was pro before I went corporate.
I can handle it.
Don't tell me your family--
Yeah, dear old dad.
Well, at least you had a choice.
Is someone forcing you to be here?
Sianon.
Now, Ms. Tobin, if you promise to be good,
I'll have your chip deactivated.
Okay?
There.
Fuck you, asshole!
Bad, bad girl!
Boy, you have a lot of fight in you.
It's too bad you're not a man.
Now, one more time, be good, and the chip is deactivated.
Okay?
Simple, there.
You're not being good.
All right.
All right?
You went through a lot of trouble, didn't you, to get chance to enter this two-bit tournament?
Well, it turns out that the majority of the public didn't consider it a true world championship without the participation of a real champion, so we convinced every champion of every style to, shall we say, enlist.
That's a lot of kidnapping.
Fortunately, they were not immune to cash inducements.
Only one champion resisted all our efforts.
Integrity is a drag.
Believe me, this was not the way we wanted to do it.
So what happens now, hmm?
What, are you going to kill me?
Is that it?
Oh, unless chance does his fight with xao?
We don't believe Mr. o'brien has a...
How do you Americans say it?
A snowball's chance in hell?
What do you want with me?
We want you to train xao.
Why would I do something like that?
Because if you don't,
Mr. o'brien's survival chances won't be very promising.
We'll reward you handsomely.
- Fuck you and your money!
- Ouch!
Before you finalize the decision, and in effect doom Mr. o'brien's life, please allow me to show you something.
He doesn't need a trainer, he needs a goddamn leash.
He's impressive, isn't he?
Yeah, but he has no heart.
He never has.
That's why chance beat him.
Yeah, unfortunately you're right.
But we're hoping that your training will give him what his poor upbringing took away.
I won't train him.
Actually, we would like you to show him a certain amount of...
Yes, love, if you will.
What the hell are you talking about?
Your attention will give him the confidence he needs to... to win.
Look what it did for o'brien.
You want me to fuck him, don't you?
No.
No.
Don't you get it?
He needs love!
Love!
I want you to love him.
That's what he needs.
This place is a little small.
This is nothing.
I've got someone here who can help you find out where is xao is staying.
Appreciate it.
This tournament, the sianon corporation's own representative, xao.
I'll do what I can to help.
But you come up against me in this tournament and I'll crush you.
You help me find xao and the tournament's yours.
Nice toys you have here.
You can't be too prepared.
Liu, we need to help Mr. o'brien find out where xao's training camp is.
Most of the corporate sites are using electronic cloaking.
It's not going to be easy.
I thought you might as well relax a while.
It's going to take some time.
What are you doing here?
Just thought I'd come and give you some pointers.
I have coaches, you know.
I know.
You know, you should switch your balance to the left.
Why don't you go back to chance o'brien where you belong?
It's over between us.
That's not what it looked like the last time
I saw the two of you together.
Things change.
Bullshit!
You know, I could have left here.
Oh?
So what are you doing here, then?
I'm here for you.
Welcome to day one of the tournament.
56 cyber corporations are represented here by the greatest fighters of all time.
Every one of them is a current or former world champion, and some, like xao of the sianon corporation, are undeclared weapons.
This tournament isn't just about who the best fighter is, but also about who has the best cyber implant system.
It's an exciting challenge for the world's cyber corporations.
For the first time, fighters will be allowed to be cybered up to 50% of their total mass.
The opening of the tournament will be handled by tung, the head of marketing for the sponsoring sianon corporation.
Welcome to the sianon tournament.
Good luck to you.
Here we go with the first round of action.
Fighters!
The first fighter is bodo, representing the du canne cyber corporation of France.
His opponent is ikila, representing the siwa cybertron corporation of Bombay.
Bodo fights in the world cybertronic association.
His style is a mutant version of outlaw shootfighting.
He is the current world champion in his weight and implant classification.
His record is 67 wins, no losses, and he has sent four men to their deaths in the ring.
Ikila is a generation one cyber fighter.
Siwa is a new corporation trying to get started.
They're hoping, with an impressive showing here, their stock prices will rise, giving them the capital they need to play with the larger corporations such as sianon and du canne.
Well, it's an apparent right off, bodo's superior cyber implants are going to win out.
He's beginning to dominate here with his super-charged speed and strength.
Bodo's just toying with ikila now.
A quick look at the stock market shows ikila's corporation is starting to lose stock value.
And that's the end.
Bodo wins with a time of 3:16.
Bodo is one of the favorites to reach the finals.
Bodo's sponsor, du canne, has seen their stock prices rise dramatically...
Representing the nubicon corporation of khartoum is tal Aziz.
The ferocious nubian has a record of 81 wins and no losses.
Tal Aziz has actually come out of retirement for this fight.
Jolly, tal Aziz's opponent, represents the tokao corporation of Singapore.
Their fighter is a journeyman in the world cyber circuit and comes here with a 47 win, three loss record.
Jolly uses the tiger style, but tal Aziz is clearly the superior fighter here.
His implants appear to give him a huge advantage.
Jolly has proven first generation cyber technology just isn't up to this competition.
Oh, my!
The nubicon corporation stock has risen by 16 points!
The tokao corporation stock, by contrast, has just collapsed.
The next challenger is the highly regarded sante.
Sante is a fluid monkey chi stylist.
Chung is the current world cyber all-around champion.
His sponsor, kalbag, is the second largest cyber corporation in the world, and their market share has risen to the point where they now challenge sianon's number one position.
Oh, my!
Chung delivers a kill blow!
That makes it 29 kills for chung!
I've located xao's whereabouts.
Well, let's go.
You're still leading with your left and you're leaving your right side open.
He's not showing much improvement.
I'm doing the best I can.
All right, I think it is time we had another little talk.
What do you want?
Haven't I done a good enough job?
I just want a little cooperation, that's all.
Okay, xao is definitely in here.
So is tung.
I'll take it from here.
Look, are you sure about this?
Huh?
They catch you, this is their island, their laws, and they can make you disappear forever.
They asked me to fight, and I'm fighting, all right?
I got to get in there.
Wait!
Wait!
A gift from liu.
Good luck.
Mr. o'brien, we are within our rights to execute you for trespassing.
You know, since you did enter the tournament, we of course offered to set Jo free, but imagine our surprise when she refused to go.
Life.
Life is truly a series of unexpected turns.
What have you done with her?
Nothing... yet.
Looks like you're going to make it.
What the hell happened?
My people found you on the street.
Looks like I got a little more than I bargained for.
Yeah, well, I hope it was worth the effort.
You're supposed to fight this morning.
I don't think you're going to make it.
That's just what tung is expecting.
Whatever you say, champ.
It's your funeral.
How's it feel?
O'brien, you're up.
Good luck.
It's a surprise to see chance o'brien here in this tournament.
His disdain for cyber-enhanced fighters is well known, and he has continually told the press that he would not compete here in this tournament.
Well, something must have changed.
Mr. o'brien's mind.
Could it be the 60 million first prize?
O'brien, of course, is considered the greatest fighter in the world today.
He has never been defeated and has continued to prove his dominance against all fighters from all weight categories from all styles.
One thing that could have caused his change of heart is the loss of his manager,
Jo, who is in xao's sianon training camp.
Perhaps he's here for a little revenge.
But skill or no skill, o'brien has got a tough road ahead of him.
He'll be facing the most jacked-up and powerful fighters he has ever faced.
O'brien's opponent is Arturo.
Arturo represents a mid-sized corporation, which operates out of Mexico city.
Arturo's record is an impressive 54 wins and no losses.
Arturo fights in nirvana style.
O'brien seems driven here.
I don't think I've ever seen him so pumped up.
He seems to be punishing his opponent.
Well, there it is.
O'brien advances, but you have to wonder if the loss of his trainer won't hamper his chances down the road.
This is an interesting match-up.
Earl is a grappling stylist from Ghana.
He represents the hassa corporation of Liberia with a record of 38 wins and one loss.
He has killed 13 men in the ring.
His opponent, bokandu, is a Kali stylist from the tokay corporation based in Jakarta.
Bokandu is an outlaw fighter who has recently been in prison for murder.
The tokay corporation got him out just for this event.
Bokandu is confused by Earl's grappling action.
It seems only a matter of time before Earl can put his infamous neck-breaker on bokandu.
There it is, the neck-breaker!
And it's over.
Earl wins, bokandu has expired.
Mario represents the zikan corporation of Brazil.
His style is that of a kendo-crane mix with the strength of the cyber-speed implants developed by the zikan corporation.
His opponent is lito.
Lito is a rising star in the Asian circuit and he was recruited by the genpact corporation to be the recipient of their new alto technology.
Well, it's back to the drawing board for the genpact corporation.
Mario wins and advances.
Chance!
Chance!
If I don't win this tournament, the company is finished.
Isn't there some way you can turn it around?
I made some bad deals along the way, some of them illegal.
My dad took the fall for me.
I can't turn that around.
Come on, let's finish our run.
Fight!
Yeah!
Final bout of the quarter-finals.
It's bodo of the du canne corporation versus chance o'brien, the only 100% human fighter in the tournament.
O'brien has a formidable opponent in front of him as bodo has killed his last three challengers in the ring.
Both stylists have speed and power.
The edge has to go bodo with all his cyber implants.
Rumors abound that bodo has secretly jacked up closer to the 60% level by disguising his microbiotic implants in live human tissue.
Implants or not, bodo doesn't seem to be able to stop o'brien's attacks.
Everything bodo tries is swept aside and answered by o'brien's relentless assault.
What a kick from o'brien!
Bodo's neck, which is listed as human, reveals cybergenic implants.
Bodo cheated, but to no avail.
O'brien advances.
Of course, for me, there is no serious competition here.
I definitely cannot foresee any competition, and as for chance o'brien, the last time was purely luck.
I'm in the greatest shape of my life thanks to my new trainer.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Are you training xao now?
What happened to you and chance o'brien?
She decided to back a winner.
What are you doing, Jo, huh?
What are you doing?
Save it for the ring, o'brien.
You're going to need it.
What I'm going to need is a broom to sweep up after what's left of you and your fucking tin man.
If that's the best he can do, we have nothing to worry about.
Jo!
Jo!
Ha!
Looks like you've got a weak spot after all.
Ow!
Stop.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Not yet.
Are you ready?
You mean when you're ready.
Bradford is well known as the fighting chairman of the board of the zanik toma corporation.
Fighters, start!
Rumors have been circulating that zanik toma is close to bankruptcy, but Bradford's appearance here shows they are not willing to go down without a fight.
Bradford has been retired the last three years as he concentrated on zanik toma, a company his father built into the fourth-leading cyber corporation in the world.
Tragically, Bradford's father--
You're going down.
I'm gonna finish you, pretty boy.
And the company has been heading downward ever since.
We'll have to see if Bradford can come back from his retirement and save the future of his company.
Start!
Bradford's opponent is mouche,
Uganda stylist from the cyberlogic corporation.
Yeah!
Ha!
Bradford's skills are still there!
He devastates mouche!
Bradford advances.
Whoo!
Hey, man.
Good luck.
I know.
I know I deserve it.
Xao is up.
Xao enters the ring after a one-year layoff.
After losing to o'brien in last year's heavyweight championship, xao was hired by the sianon corporation.
The end result of that partnership will be seen tonight, as this will be xao's first fight with his new state-of-the-art implants.
Obviously sianon is expecting xao to make an impressive impact here in the tournament.
Xao has coasted through the other rounds as opponents have defaulted or have been injured in training.
Xao's opponent here is tal Aziz, the nubian from the nubicon corporation.
Both companies' market shares and reputations are on the line.
Fight!
And here we go.
What a battle this should be with xao, a disciple of the wing chun school, and tal Aziz, a nuba stylist.
Oh, my!
Xao is incredible.
His speed and power are going to be too much for the nubian.
Christ, he makes me think twice about fighting him.
I think tal Aziz knows he's in trouble here.
What a horrifying glimpse into the future of cyber-fighting.
Xao is a virtual superhuman killing machine.
Nothing in this tournament is likely to stop him.
For the three corporations remaining in the tournament, trillions of dollars are on the line.
With so much at stake, tomorrow's bouts promise to be the greatest battles of all time.
Be there.
I want a guarantee that chance won't get hurt.
How can I do that, Jo?
I've only agreed not to kill him.
What control do I have if he continues fighting in the tournament?
Disqualify him or something.
It's your tournament.
It's your island.
I'm sure you can figure out a way.
That would arouse suspicion, Jo.
And I agree with you, it's a surprise Mr. o'brien has made it to the semi-finals, but now if something were to happen, the outcome would be devastating to the tournament.
Please.
I've done all you asked.
And more.
I don't want chance to fight xao.
Xao will kill him.
Oh, put your mind at ease, Jo.
I think it's very unlikely Mr. o'brien will reach a bout with xao.
His opponent tomorrow is formidable.
Yeah, Mr. o'brien's heroic march will end.
- I'm sure of it.
- Thank you.
Thank you?
For what?
Hey!
Hey!
Mr. tung would like to see you.
Just take a minute.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Just relax!
Relax.
Hey, listen.
There you go, sir.
What the fuck is going on?
We are not to be seen together.
I watched you today, Bradford.
I don't know, you were quite helpful to o'brien.
I can't just do nothing.
You told me to befriend him--
But I didn't say make him a winner.
Xao is a bit nervous about o'brien, you see.
They have this history.
Look, chance is good, but he's not all together.
You've seen to that.
And he won't get any cyber enhancements to overcome his injuries.
I don't think xao should worry.
My thoughts exactly, but xao would like to see him further handicapped, and I'm inclined to agree since there's no sense of risking any possibility of defeat.
What do you have in mind?
During your match tomorrow, injure him seriously.
Easier said than done.
Figure out a way, Bradford.
I'm still supposed to lose to him--
Yes.
Yes.
A match between xao and o'brien is what we've worked for, is it not?
That's what you've worked for.
Me, I expect you to buy me out of my stocks.
Loan the toma corporation the two trillion dollars you promised and get my father out of prison.
The moment you injure o'brien and lose to him, the deal is closed.
If you screw me in any way--
You'll do what, Bradford?
You'll do what?
I don't think your father would appreciate any foolish acts.
Jail can be a dangerous place.
Things can happen.
He's looking good, isn't he?
Now we're down to our last four competitors, and what a group they are.
The greatest fighters in the world today.
Xao has brutally destroyed every opponent he has faced so far.
All three have been killed, and with frightening ease.
Sianon has certainly done a remarkable job with xao's cyber implants.
They seem to be far ahead of all the others.
Xao's opponent, chung, has also cruised through his matches.
He is three for three in kills, but there are big questions for chung in this match.
Can his ruthless killer instinct and speed offset xao's extraordinary power and relentless attack?
You're just a fucking tin man!
I think he knows he's in for the fight of his life.
Xao's attack appears unstoppable.
Chung can't seem to find the answer.
Oh, my!
I've never seen anyone do this to chung!
Xao is handling him with such ease, it's mind-boggling.
Xao is toying with chung, punishing him.
He's literally tearing the flesh off chung's cybergenics.
That's it!
Another impressive kill for xao.
He moves into the championship tomorrow, and as I check the sianon stock, it is going through the roof.
Success in the market and the fact that this tournament has become the most widely watched event in history has to have the sianon people ecstatic.
Stepping into the ring, world champion chance o'brien.
And here comes his opponent,
Bradford wharton of the zanik toma corporation.
The winner of this fight advances into tomorrow's championship bout against xao of sianon.
We've observed o'brien and wharton training together all week, and I'm sure all bets and friendships here are off in this semi-final bout.
Both men have a tremendous amount at stake.
O'brien, using a kickboxing tae Kwon do style punched up to power shootfighting, while wharton favors a smoother, softer aikido tamata style.
Wharton is the matador, o'brien the bull.
Wharton the flashy showman, o'brien the blue collar warrior.
Oh, my!
O'brien's hurt.
He's down!
This could be over.
All wharton needs to do is move in and finish o'brien.
But wharton seems to be more preoccupied with playing to the crowd.
This could be a giant mistake that wharton may regret.
O'brien is up.
Wharton has missed a chance for a quick end to this fight.
O'brien is coming on strong.
He seems fully recovered.
Oh, my!
Wharton goes down and he's out.
O'brien wins!
O'brien wins!
Who would have thought a 100% human could come this far?
Chance!
Chance!
Now the world will see who the real champion is.
So o'brien advances in a shocker to the championship match against xao.
Next time you won't be so lucky.
You had a shot.
Why didn't you take it?
Ah, you beat me fair and square.
That's all there is to it.
Someone put acid in my gloves.
You son of a bitch!
You promised me chance wouldn't fight xao.
No, I said it was highly unlikely--
Well, forget it.
The deal is off.
I'm telling xao what's going on.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, come here.
I've looked for Jo everywhere.
Have you seen her?
As a matter of fact, I have.
Look.
Hurt me and Jo dies.
You get to kill chance o'brien tomorrow.
That's not such a bad thing, is it?
Don't say anything.
I have to.
Leave him.
You have an important fight tomorrow.
Just concentrate on that.
Looks like I fucked up again.
What the hell?
What's going on?
It's tung.
He threatened to kill my father if I didn't help him.
Tung promised xao he could have Jo...
He could have Jo if he beat you.
- I want to see Jo.
- She's safe for now.
You lose to xao today, you get her back.
Put up a good fight, the best you've ever done, but lose.
And if I don't think much of the fight you put up...
Jo dies.
Do we understand each other?
So what is it now, Mr. tung?
Gentlemen, tomorrow the sianon corporation will be crowned the greatest bioengineering company in the world.
But how can you guarantee success?
How can you be sure xao will not lose heart and match?
Well, it's true there are many variables in the sporting match.
Even with all his perfection, there are weaknesses.
And how do you overcome that?
The only true advantage the American has over us...
Is his emotional commitment.
We will give xao his own.
Mr. tung, if you fuck this up,
I will have you gutted.
Do you understand my meaning?
What a match-up for the championship.
Sianon couldn't have hoped for a better ending to this incredible tournament.
Xao, the sianon representative, has clearly established the superiority of the sianon product line.
Here comes xao.
He is accompanied by the head of marketing for sianon, tung.
Also in xao's party, o'brien's ex-manager, Jo Tobin.
And now this is a surprise, liu,
Bradford wharton's assistant.
It seems everyone is shifting over to what is appearing to be the winning team.
Xao's transformation from a good fighter to a competitor of this caliber is truly extraordinary.
And for it all to come down to beating chance o'brien, the reigning world champion, the fighter considered one of the greatest of all time and the only 100% pure human in the tournament.
What a story this has become.
Chance!
Chance!
The last time these two men met has no bearing on this because xao just isn't the same fighter he was back then.
Don't make me use the remote, Mr. o'brien.
Don't forget.
It seems some words are being exchanged, but the fighters move out to the center of the ring.
There is no love lost between these two, certainly not for the defection of o'brien's manager to xao's camp.
This shapes up as a fight with many aspects.
It's cyber versus human, traditional kung fu against high-tech shootfighting, and the past versus the future.
And we're just about ready to get underway.
Fight!
Here we go.
There's no holding back.
Both fighters are unloading right from the top.
Can they keep this up?
Both men are attacking relentlessly, trying to destroy one another as quickly as possible.
There seems to be something going on between o'brien and tung.
Oh, my!
O'brien is destroying xao.
He is using his famous sudden strike to rip xao's cybergenics apart.
Damn, liu has pulled a gun!
I don't know what this means!
Oh, my!
Xao is down.
Incredible!
We'll have to see how xao deals with this.
Sianon has to be concerned here.
It seems impossible, but xao is down again.
Tung is stepping out into the ring.
He's got his gun on o'brien!
Here comes xao.
O'brien is on tung and knocks out tung.
Christ!
Xao has been shot!
Jo is struggling with liu.
Oh, my!
What is going on?
This is turning out to be a disaster for sianon.
Chance!
Chance!
Previously on X-Men...
What have you done with my wife ?
Mrs. Summers is iust another broken blossom, floating through the winds of time.
They've taken Jean to the one place you can't get to.
And where is here ?
Here is the Axis of Time, where all times cross.
Mr. Sinister tried to capture both of us.
Now Apocalypse has taken the Shi'ar courtier known as Oracle.
If Apocalypse and Sinister have joined forces, all existence is in danger.
We'll use Cerebro to track down other mutants with psychic powers.
And we'll be there when Apocalypse or Sinister strikes.
Guess again !
May I help ?
Magneto !
What do you want with me ?
Don't worry.
No harm will come to you yet.
What happened ?
Where are the others ?
We messed up.
Psylocke's gone.
I bet this clown knows what's going on.
It seems that Charles Xavier has deduced the pattern of my plan.
All the better as he will be my final prize.
I wanted to nail Apocalypse by destroying his Lazarus Chamber.
Our only hope is to go so far back that we get rid of the chamber at its point of origin.
The government still has a time machine ?
It's in there.
And we're going to borrow it.
- Guess who ?
- Not again !
And again, and again, and again and again and again.
Look, clown, I've had a long day, or week, or however long it's been.
All walk and no play makes Bishop a dull boy.
- What was that ?
- A great being threatens time itself.
Knowledge is power !
Let's watch these guys.
That's Cable !
It will be.
It would be.
It can be, it could be, and maybe it should be.
Can we be ?
- Ready, Dad ?
- Yeah, kid.
Start the ball.
Okay, guys.
Give us 30 seconds, then let's lose one power station.
I wish you'd let me go with you.
I know, Tyler.
But if I don't make it, I need you to carry on here.
I know you'll make me proud.
Remember, Dad, the energy dome will only be down for a minute.
Tyler, the dome is still up !
They've run into heavy resistance !
- What's happening ?
- I'm not getting any word from them !
Tyler, the power station must be destroyed !
It's the only chance we have !
Tyler ?
Are you all right ?
Tyler !
Dad !
Get going !
I'll be back for you !
Take your time.
I'll be gone in a minute.
Graymalkin.
I hope they kept your battery charged.
What's happening ?
You yearn to destroy my resting place at its inception.
A wise strategy.
But first, you have a service to perform.
What am I doing here ?
I was about to ask you the very same thing.
I don't care about missing psychics and time jolts.
I'm after Apocalypse.
Look.
Apocalypse was involved in at least one of the kidnappings.
My guess is that our interests coincide.
You're boring me.
If you want to help me nail him, get your team together, and let's get started !
It is conceivable that a powerful force traveling through time creates a backwash, a kind of wake, that disrupts the paths of normal time travelers.
It's lust a theory.
You have no evidence this happened to my brother.
Bishop's disappearance in time fits the computer model perfectly.
Note the effect of the more powerful time traveler on the first.
You're too stupid to plan this on your own.
- Who are you working for ?
- Suck rocks, pretty boy.
The Professor wants you in the War Room.
Why not ?
I'm just wasting my time here.
Okay, hairball.
Let's talk.
It's called the Lazarus Chamber.
I discovered it, will discover it, 2000 years from now.
It's the secret to Apocalypse's longevity.
He goes into hibernation there every 100 years.
So that's it !
All my research pointed to periodic dormant times for Apocalypse.
But I could never discover why or where !
I destroyed the chamber in my time, in 3999.
But before I did, Apocalypse grabbed my time travel device.
Now he can just return to any time before the chamber was destroyed to rejuvenate himself.
I'm going back to when the pyramid was first built and get rid of it then.
Let's do it !
Wait a minute !
What about Sinister and the missing psychics ?
Find someone who cares !
I left my son back there so I could get at Apocalypse.
I may never see Tyler again.
- There's more to this than lust him !
- No, there isn't.
Sabretooth's working for the guy.
Everybody might be.
I understood that he had refused to talk.
He changed his mind.
What else did he say ?
The pieces to the puzzle don't fit.
Why on earth would Magneto be involved with Apocalypse ?
It took an hour to get that out of him.
You want more, you know how to get it.
I have chosen not to invade the minds of others without their consent.
If it's important, get it out of him.
Or I will.
Very well.
Cable is right !
We must stop him at all costs !
- What did you see ?
- Portals.
Clocks.
Time-related images.
Apocalypse seems bent on mastering time itself, and has persuaded some of the most powerful mutants on Earth to help him.
If we take out his life-support system, then none of this will ever take place.
I agree, Cable.
Shard, you, Rogue and Jubilee stay here, in case Cable's theory proves wrong.
Why can't I go ?
Don't you think I can handle it ?
It's not that, Shard.
If we fail, your ability to travel through time may be your brother's last hope.
I want to go with you.
There's no room on this mission for vengeance.
I don't know.
Revenge can sure help you focus.
Not for me anymore.
I know what's at stake now.
Tiny, meddling insects !
They don't realize that he who controls time,
- controls every eventuality !
- Apocalypse.
You summoned me ?
Yes.
The endgame has begun.
Good thing they don't serve lunch on this flight.
Watch it !
Billions of miles of space and people still can't drive !
The pyramid's over the rise, down river.
Storm, take Archangel and scout ahead to see if the pyramid is guarded.
We will follow on the ground.
Beautiful, is it not ?
My parents loved this land.
And though my life was hard after they were gone, I loved it, too.
The pyramid appears to be unguarded.
Bring the others up while I make sure.
Your timing is perfect, Cable.
Those stone blocks at the base suggest that construction has recently been completed.
We will need a diversion to cover our approach.
You shall have it, Professor.
Wind, howl and raise the sands of the desert !
Before we go in, I lust wanted to say I'm sorry about your son.
I know what it's like to lose someone you love.
I haven't lost him yet.
Professor, do you know anything more about why Apocalypse is kidnapping psychics ?
Who cares ?
He's pure evil, and that's why he's got to go !
If Apocalypse is indeed the personification of evil,
- it may be impossible to destroy him.
- Why ?
The conflict between good and evil is part of the fabric of existence.
Perhaps the world cannot exist without evil.
If Apocalypse is destroyed, evil may only take another form.
I'll worry about that later.
The entrance is there, behind that stone !
Allow me.
Shall we see who is at home ?
The Four Horsemen !
Cable was right !
Apocalypse has protected himself !
There's no use fighting me !
I had your job once.
Go get Apocalypse !
We can hold these guys here !
Just be careful !
Cable, Wolverine, Beast, come with me !
Don't move !
- What is it ?
- Fresh tree sap ?
- I know where all the booby traps are.
Beast !
Maybe next time you'll trust my nose.
Thanks.
I don't know how I missed that one before.
Apparently Apocalypse will make a few alterations in the next 5000 years.
They're going back in to save the chamber !
Inside !
Now !
Well, you'll be here in 5000 years, which way do we go ?
Where you going ?
I told you I knew where the booby traps were.
It appears fighting metal with flesh is poor tactics.
That's more like it !
Cable !
Look out !
- Hey, pal, leave a few of them for us.
- The Lazarus Chamber.
It's in there.
- What's the verdict, doc ?
- Nothing broken.
However,
I would not count on him helping much in the next few minutes.
We'll pick up Cable on our way back.
Now, let's find Apocalypse and do what we came to do.
Magnificent.
The pyramid acts as a huge energy collector to regenerate Apocalypse as he sleeps.
- Wait !
I smell two rats in this barn !
- Something is wrong.
It's...
Now, Apocalypse !
Xavier ?
Wolverine ?
Cyclops !
What happened ?
- What was that ?
- The most important move of all.
The capture of the king !
Professor Charles Xavier !
Excuse me.
Could you point me to the foreman?
You're lookin' at him.
Name's Ben Kohler.
I was wonderin' if you have any work.
Doin' what, entertaining the troops?
Doubt you'd pay me to do that.
I've done just about every kind of job there is.
I operated a crane in Dallas.
I was a welder in L.A. Bricklayer in Paris.
- As in France?
- Texas.
- What about it?
You got a job?
- Sorry.
We got nothin'.
I got a list of about 40 guys ahead of you.
There's not much construction goin' on in Seattle right now.
I'll take those keys, man!
Give me the keys!
- Here you go.
Take it.
- Give me your wallet.
- Come on!
- Okay.
Guitar.
It's worthless to you.
I've had it since I was-
Gunshot wound to the head.
He's losing blood fast.
Get Respiratory down here.
Start a second line.
D5W.
Clean him up.
- I need to see that entry point.
- Temporal lobe.
- Anybody got an exit?
- No.
The bullet's still in there.
Let's get a head X-ray, blood gases and EEG Stat.
Out of the way, please.
Okay, folks, he's all yours.
I need that second line now.
I would like to implant the new-generation cerebral chip.
He's the first ideal subject we've had.
He's 35, healthy.
Good vitals.
But, Doctor, the new-generation chips aren't tested in humans.
We don't know its side effects.
The previous generation of the chip killed everyone we tried it in.
It didn't kill everyone.
I'm confident we've remedied the rejection problem.
- And what if you haven't?
- I can't prove it works... unless I test it on a human subject.
- What are his chances?
- Good.
Fifteen lab chimps have had the new implant for two years with no mortality.
We're running out of time.
- Will you authorize?
- All right.
She's throwing too many PVC's.
Drop a hundred milligrams of lidocaine.
IV's almost through.
Let's hang up another bag.
Starting climate equalization.
Saw.
Get... out of my head!
There is nothing wrong with your television.
Do not attempt to adjust the picture.
We are now controlling the transmission.
We control the horizontal... and the vertical.
We can deluge you with a thousand channels... or expand one single image to crystal clarity... and beyond.
We can shape your vision... to anything our imagination can conceive.
For the next hour... we will control all that you see and hear.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery... which reaches from the deepest inner mind to...
The Outer Limits.
It is a common scientific belief... that humans use but a small fraction of the brain.
Researchers all over the world try to unlock the secrets... hidden in these darkened parts of the mind.
But do we really want to unlock such secrets?
And how will we deal with the dark discoveries that lie within?
- How are we doin'?
- BP 110 over 75.
Pulse 80.
All right.
The first test is gonna be to disconnect bypass.
So we see if the chip regulates his breathing and heartbeat?
That's right.
Go ahead.
- Irregular heartbeat.
- Come on.
Come on, cut in.
Six milligrams Atnodine.
Normal sinus rhythm.
BP is holding.
He's breathing on his own.
Nice work, Doctor.
Let's close.
- Any change?
- No.
- What do you think?
- He's only been out eight hours... but his heart and lung functions are perfect... even more regular than a human brain could keep them.
My only concern is that his lateral sulcus was damaged.
- He won't be able to speak.
- I hope he will.
I hooked up the oral channels in the cerebral chip... but we've never been able to test that function.
I hope we've made the right decision for this man.
Sir.
I spent eight years in the research wing perfecting the cerebral chip.
- It'll work.
- It better, Doctor.
For your sake and for the hospital's.
I'll see you at the press conference. 3:00.
Sir?
Sir?
Can you see me?
Am I dead?
You're very much alive.
- What's your name?
- Ben Kohler.
Call Dr. Lambert.
Tell him the good news.
Mr. Kohler can talk.
Boy, does my head hurt.
Get out of my head.
Leave me alone.
Please.
Get out!
So, Doc, be straight with me.
- How long do I have?
- Mr. Kohler... if you do exactly as I say- take good care of yourself- there's no reason why you can't live a long and relatively normal life.
I won't lie to you.
This procedure is very experimental.
That makes the results... unpredictable.
Very experimental?
How many other people have this thing in their head?
We tested the old CCI on several people... but, actually, you're the first to get this version of the chip.
- The first?
- It's okay, Mr. Kohler.
The CCI has been thoroughly tested.
It's safe.
What happened to the people who had the old version?
They all died, didn't they?
We had mixed results.
But I want you to understand-
Who gave you permission to use me as a guinea pig!
Who were we going to ask, Mr. Kohler?
We didn't know who you were.
There was no wallet, no next of kin.
You were unconscious.
You would have died.
You should consider yourself very, very lucky... that you were near this particular hospital, near me.
- You would be dead by now.
- I feel very lucky.
Leave me alone!
Get out of my head!
Get out of my head.!
God.!
Leave me alone.
I operate alone.
I operate alone.
I operate alone!
Jennifer, there are two reporters in the lobby... who want to talk to you and Mr. Kohler.
- I told you- no interviews.
- Tell them yourself.
For three weeks, I have been acting like your press agent.
I have better things to do.
You're right.
Call Dr. Lambert and tell him to have Security handle it from now on.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Sally, have you seen Mr. Kohler?
Yeah.
He's in the children's ward.
Dr. Martinez.
Say hi, everybody.
- Hi, Dr. Martinez.
- Hello.
Dr. Martinez is gonna sing "Hickory Dickory Dock" with us, aren't you?
- No.
I don't sing.
- Sure you do.
- Don't we all wanna hear her sing?
- Yeah!
It's really nice of the staff to give me this guitar.
Well, it was well appreciated by all... especially the children in the pediatric ward.
After a month in here, I would've gone nuts without it, so thank you.
Mr. Kohler, I can't emphasize this enough.
You have a miracle in your head.
Don't take it for granted.
What do you think I'm gonna do, bang my head against the wall?
I don't like the sound of this apartment of yours.
- Is it clean, dry, warm?
- I'll be fine.
- You have the instructions I gave you?
- Yes.
You have my beeper number.
- Call me anytime- day or night-
- Dr. M.
We're gonna need you.
Auto accident.
Teenage girl has a piece of the guardrail lodged in her abdominal cavity.
You're the only surgeon available.
Mr. Kohler, can you wait for me?
Mr. Kohler.
Don't worry about it.
It wasn't your chip that made me pass out.
I just want to be sure.
Doc, that girl that came in was covered in blood.
I don't much like the sight of blood, if you know what I mean.
- Have you ever passed out before?
- Well-
Yeah.
Mr. Kohler, don't be embarrassed.
Seventy-five percent of the men that walk in here... are squeamish at the sight of blood.
Half pass out.
Well, then I'd better get out of here before another bloody body rolls in.
Thank you for saving my life.
If there's anything I can do-
You can take care of yourself.
Stop!
Stop!
What are you lookin' at?
Huh?
Get out of my head!
I don't know what to tell you.
We've done a CAT scan and an EEG.
The readout from the chip is normal.
My only guess would be that the hallucinations are caused... by the antirejection drugs we gave you.
Look, it was more than a hallucination.
Much more.
I was having feelings- of excitement, fear, anger- that I didn't understand.
It was like I had someone else's emotions.
I had memories, but they weren't my own.
It was like I had somebody else's brain for that moment.
Or my brain was in someone else's head.
Look, I'm sure you felt all those things.
But I built the CCl2 myself, and, I am telling you... what you're describing could not be caused by my chip.
Or at least you won't admit it was caused by your chip.
God forbid your ticket to the top should have a flaw.
I resent that.
My first responsibility is to you, the patient.
Then figure out what's wrong with your chip and call me.
Hey, beautiful.
Looks like we have someone with us- someone who likes to look where he has no business looking.
Why don't you say hello?
Nice you could join us.
Mr. Kohler!
Mr. Kohler!
Ben.
You're here in the hospital.
What happened?
What-
Somebody in Homicide, please.
Homicide.
Lieutenant Wilson speaking.
Yes.
- This is gonna sound crazy.
- Nothing sounds crazy to me anymore, pal.
Let me guess- you know who shotJohn F. Kennedy.
Have there been any women murdered in the woods?
There are a lot of woods around this city, sir.
What woods would you be talking about?
I don't know.
I wasn't actually there.
- We need a trace on three.
- That's why this sounds so crazy.
I saw it happen.
I mean, not in person.
I think I saw it through the killer's eyes.
Never mind.
It was a hallucination.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Just a minute.
Don't hang up.
What's your name?
- I'd rather not say.
- Okay, fine.
Listen, we did have a homicide in the woods out by Cave Springs.
- When, this morning?
- We found the body this afternoon.
- Sir, are you still there?
- Yes.
Listen, we kept this out of the press.
How exactly did you see it?
Let's just say I saw it telepathically.
Telepathically.
Well, you know, sir, someone with your telepathic ability... would be a great asset to the police department.
Why don't you come on down, have a talk with us?
We'd like to meet you.
Sir, are you there?
Did we get it?
We didn't get it.
- Come here.
- Hey, hey.
Ben.
Ben.
Come here.
I gotta talk to you.
- We can't-
- Just come here.
A killing like the one I saw really happened.
So you think what you saw was real and not a hallucination?
How else do you explain it?
- How about a coincidence?
- I'm not gonna debate this with you.
I know it was real.
Then why don't you go to the police?
They'd throw me in jail before I finished telling the story.
- Why would they do that?
- Just think about it.
A guy shows up, knows all the gruesome details of a murder... but says he wasn't there- says he saw it because of some chip in his head.
- They're not gonna buy that.
- I'll go with you.
- I'll tell them about the chip.
- No police.
You have a problem with the police?
Not any more than anybody else.
If I'm gonna help you, you're gonna have to trust me.
Well, I do trust you.
- Then tell me about you and the police.
- There's nothing to tell.
- Fine.
Do you want me to call them, or-
- All right.
I did time when I was 19.
For what?
Manslaughter.
Don't get all freaked out.
- It's not what it sounds like.
- What happened?
I was in a bar.
This guy about three times my size started forcing himself on this girl- putting his hands where they didn't belong- so I intervened... with a pool cue right over his head.
I didn't mean to kill him though.
Anyway, cops busted me, railroaded me through the system.
I spent three years in jail for saving a girl from getting raped.
I'm sorry.
All right.
No police.
But I'm going to have to check you back into the hospital.
Come on.
A month in here was enough.
How can I figure out what's going on in your head if I can't observe you?
Can't you observe me somewhere else?
Come on in.
So, this is it.
- You should be comfortable here.
- Nice place.
I see brain surgery's treated you very well.
The kitchen and the bathroom are in there.
You can sleep on the couch.
Why are you taking me into your home?
Because you wouldn't stay in the hospital.
That's kind of above and beyond the call of duty, isn't it?
If I'm gonna figure out what's going on with the chip...
I need you around me for constant observation.
You're willing to take this huge risk just for this thing that's in my head?
- Risk?
- I do have a record.
How do you know I didn't kill those women?
- The thought crossed my mind.
- But you didn't call the cops.
I like to think of myself as a pretty good judge of character.
Besides, I don't think that a man who faints at the sight of blood... would make it a habit of stabbing women to death.
- You know what I think?
- What?
I think you don't wanna risk the cops putting me in jail.
'Cause if they put me in that little 3-by-5-foot room- with God knows who else- they put your precious chip in there too.
Then you can't keep tabs on it.
You don't let up, do you?
You don't trust anybody, not even someone who's trying to help you.
Come on.
You're not trying to help me.
All you're interested in is making yourself famous.
You gotta look out for number one.
I learned that that night in the bar.
You start caring about somebody- you can't step on 'em on your way up the ladder.
- You don't believe that.
- Everybody does, including you.
You just won't let it be a conscious thought.
You can help yourself to anything in the fridge.
There's only one bathroom so...
do knock before you come in.
Benny boy, you're just in time.
You like my lady?
She only cost a hundred bucks.
How do you know my name?
Can you hear me?
I get in your head too, Benny.
I mean, so farjust during thejuicy stuff.
But I'm hopin' for more.
Much more.
Who you talkin' to?
Come and get me, Benny boy!
He knows my name.
Make it stop.
This is a mistake.
We have never attempted to adjust a CCl2 after implantation.
- There's no telling what it can do.
- I don't care.
If it's gonna stop these visions, I wanna try it.
I can't handle it anymore.
If this guy is real, like you say... don't you feel an obligation to stop him, save his victims?
What do you want me to do?
Last time I tried to help somebody...
I got thrown in jail for three years.
Every time I have a vision, I see his memories.
I see horrible things.
I feel the pleasure he gets in killing his victims.
I feel psychotic.
With every vision, I'm getting a little bit more like him, and that's gotta stop.
'Cause I don't wanna kill anybody.
You understand me?
We usually keep the chip running at 35 microamps.
If we lower the current, it may or may not "induce" the visions... but it may also not communicate with your body anymore.
Which means it can shut down your lungs, your heart... your eyes or any combination thereof.
Will you just do it!
Check that one level one more time for me.
- I've got it at 34 microns.
- Okay.
This interface can transmit adjustments to the chip.
What I am attempting to do is to reduce the C current slightly.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
You got me into this.
You get me out.
Thirty-four microamps.
Thirty-three.
Thirty-two.
Damn it!
He's phasing.
Okay, move it over here.
200!
Clear!
Again!
250!
Clear!
Charging.
Damn.
All right.
He's at level 16 again.
It's 33.
He's now stabilizing.
Why can't we try the adjustment again?
Because... your heart may not survive another fibrillation.
I want you alive.
You worried about me or just your chip?
Both.
What are you doin' all alone?
I'm not alone.
I have friends.
My parents are still alive.
I have a sister.
You know what I mean.
Why isn't there a man in your life?
I don't think that's any of your business.
You shouldn't have any problems attracting one.
- You're beautiful.
You're smart.
- I need to take another reading.
Some guy break your heart, Doc?
Is that why you're so cold?
Would you just hold still for one minute?
After you answer the question.
Who was he, some doctor?
He was a cardiologist, and we were supposed to be married lastJuly.
- What happened?
- I caught him in the morgue... on the autopsy table- with a blonde pathologist.
And you wonder why I don't trust anybody.
Okay.
Now, will you just hold still a minute?
How's that thing work?
Shouldn't you have to stick a needle in my head or something?
Not that I want you to do that.
The cerebral chip and the monitor communicate at a very low RF.
- RF?
- Radio frequency.
Hey, wait a minute.
- That might explain what's going on.
- What?
The CCI actually broadcasts and receives signals... to and from the monitoring device.
- So?
- If the killer had a chip in his head... you might be receiving signals from it.
That would explain it.
How many other people have this chip?
Four have the old version, but-
There's something I don't understand.
Why would you only receive signals every now and then... and why not all the time?
I only seem to get it when there's a killing.
Maybe... it's when the killer gets pumped or scared or excited or something.
Adrenaline.
Adrenaline must be hyperstimulating the CCI.
Does that mean you can stop the visions?
- Only if the killer's heavily sedated.
- Let's find out who it is.
We tested the old chip on several volunteers about three years ago.
They all had terminal brain tumors.
Unfortunately, all but these four rejected the chip and died.
- I still monitor them on a weekly basis.
- I think we can rule them out.
It's a man.
It's not him.
I can see the killer's hands in the visions.
They're white.
Unfortunately, only those four are still alive.
Wait.
Go back.
I operate alone!
His name is Wayne Haas, but he died in a fire about a year ago.
He was an accountant, and his office burned down.
Where did he live?
Do you know?
It was an awful place.
I think it was condemned.
You gotta take me there.
Dear God!
Dear God!
Dear God!
Her head's cut open.
Oh, my God!
We gotta call the police.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.
- It's never been this bad!
What's wrong?
- I don't know.
Feels like my head's gonna explode!
Ben, what is it?
What are you seeing?
Tell me.
Outside a house.
Looks familiar.
- What?
- He's here!
This is great, Benny.
I saw you coming through your eyes.
Why are you fighting me, Doctor?
He's hurt.
Let me help him.
Poor Benny.
He's gonna be okay.
I called the cops.
They're on their way.
They're gonna take care of him.
Get up!
Get in the driver's seat, sweetheart.
I thought you were dead.
That's because that's what I wanted you to think.
But they found the body.
That poor man shouldn't have been in my office when it caught on fire.
Get us outta here!
Police!
Stay put!
Don't move.
You're under arrest.
Okay, I'm trying to understand.
You admit you were the one who called us the other day.
- Yes, but-
- And you know all the bloody details... of these murders because you saw them with some kind of ESP.
No, not ESP.
I have a computer chip in my brain.
A computer chip in the brain.
So you receive signals from aliens telling you to kill.
- Is that it?
- Will you just listen to what I'm saying!
He's gotJennifer, doing God knows what with her... and you're sittin' around asking me a bunch of stupid questions.
You listen to me.
I don't care if you killed those women... because you got a computer chip in your brain or because Satan told you to... or because aliens told you to- I don't care why.
I care where, when, who and how many.
- How many women did you kill?
- None.
It was a guy named Wayne Haas.
- Wayne Haas is dead.
We checked.
- No, he's not.
- How do you know?
- Because he has a chip in his brain too.
I can see things through his eyes.
Of course.
Why didn't I realize that?
Will you please just send someone out to find Haas and Dr. Jennifer Martinez?
Answer my question, and I'll look into what you're talking about.
Deal?
Go ahead.
Was the woman you killed around the beginning of December the first one?
- Is that when they started?
- You tell me.
When where the others?
The ones we know about were December 2...
December 10, December 22.
You think something's funny about that?
I was listed in critical condition from December 1 to December 3.
I spent about a month after that in the hospital
- St. Vincent's Hospital.
You can call and check it out.
My doctor was Dr. Martinez.
Look, check it out.
Hurry.
There you go.
There.
Gosh.
This is a very special moment in our relationship.
- Why are you doing this?
- Why?
My brain hurts an awful lot.
I need a new one.
I figured you must take awful good care of yours.
Mr. Haas.
You can't transplant a brain- mine or anyone else's.
It wouldn't survive outside the body.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Run a check on her, okay?
Hey, Benny.
- Benny, are you still with me?
- What?
Hey, Benny boy.
Do you think-
Do you think her brain will fit inside of my head?
Come on.
Come on, where are you?
You're never gonna know where I am, Benny.
I've been too careful.
You know, I've been lookin' all over for a good, clean brain.
I gotta tell ya.
They're very hard to come by.
Dr. M. Here is my last chance of gettin' a good one.
And once you're rotting' away in jail, I'm gonna have to stop lookin'.
Hey.
What do you think of this room?
Mirrors everywhere.
You can observe the transplant.
Huh?
You can watch me open up her head.
- Yeah.
In the mirror.
- You leave her alone!
Sure.
Okay, Ben.
Guess we owe you an apology.
Hospital confirmed your alibi.
Also confirmed... you got some kind of hardware in your head.
Hey.
You okay?
Hey.
Hey.
There it is.
That's the sign I saw.
Roberts, you head around the east side.
- I've got the west side of the building.
- Where?
Are you okay?
You took an awful lot of those tranquilizers.
It's the only way he can't see me.
No adrenaline, no transmission-
Hey, Benny.!
You trying something'here?
Are you seeing something?
What's wrong?
Thirty-two microamps.
What's that mean?
Huh?
- You have to let me go in there alone.
- No way.
I can't.
- You have to.
- It's too dangerous.
Listen, Lieutenant.
She saved my life.
You gotta give me a chance to repay that favor.
Besides, I'm the only person who can see what he sees.
I can sneak in in a way that he's not looking.
I'm sorry.
There's no way.
I'd lose my job.
I'm gonna call in a negotiator and a SWAT team.
You wait here.
Hey, guys.
Now listen.
We don't know what's goin' on down here.
We're gonna have to be careful.
We don't wanna panic this guy.
We don't want him to know we're out here.
I'm just doin' what you always told me to do, Doctor- take care of myself.
My brain hurts.
It hurts.
Ben, don't do it.
You'll both arrest.
Get the door!
Come on!
Cover the back!
- Untie me!
Untie me!
- Get the paramedics in here now!
Come on.
Somebody take care of this guy.
Come on, Ben!
200!
Clear!
- Again!
- Charging!
200!
300!
Clear!
Again!
400!

Oh God!

He's gone.
- Why isn't it working?
Again!
- I've got no signs.
Clear!
- Nothing, ma'am.
- Again!
Clear!
- There's nothing there, ma'am.
- Please, ma'am.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.
You did the best you could.
If you were offered the chance... to communicate with another person's mind... would you choose to do it, knowing that, in return... you would have to expose your own deepest... and most intimate thoughts?

Zordon:
KEEP LOOKING, ALPHA.
WE MUST FIND WHAT IT IS
THAT KEPT AISHA IMMUNE FROM HATE MASTER'S HATE DUST.
ALPHA, HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING YET?
NOT SO FAR, AISHA.
IF WE CAN DISCOVER WHAT IS SHIELDING AISHA
WE MAY BE ABLE TO USE IT
TO BREAK HATE MASTER'S SPELL ON THE RANGERS.
FINDING IT IS OUR ONLY HOPE FOR SAVING THEM.
ZORDON!
I'VE GOT SOMETHING!
IT'S COMING FROM AISHA'S NECKLACE.
IT'S EMITTING SOME KIND OF STRONG ENERGY WAVE.
MY GRANDMOTHER GAVE ME THIS NECKLACE.
ACCORDING TO MY READINGS, THIS STONE
HAS BEEN ABSORBING THE ENERGY WAVES
OF THOSE WHO HAVE HANDLED IT.
YES.
IT'S ENERGY APPEARS TO BE MADE OF UP LOVE
GENEROSITY AND CARING.
THOSE POWERFUL ENERGIES
MUST HAVE ACTED AS A SHIELD
AGAINST HATE MASTER'S DUST...
AY-YI-YI!
SOMEONE'S PULLED OUR PLUG!
WE'VE LOST ALL POWER!
ZORDON'S GONE.
Alpha:
WE'VE LOST THE BACKUP GENERATORS TOO!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF YOU, ZORDON.
AM I GOOD, OR WHAT?
HELLO, LITTLE NERD BOY.
IS THIS ANOTHER INVENTION?
GET A LIFE.
LISTEN, YOU SNIPPY LITTLE UPSTART.
EXCUSE ME?
YOU HEARD ME.
FOR YOUR INFORMATION
I JUST CUT THE POWER OFF TO THE COMMAND CENTER.
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND A MALL
TO INFLICT YOURSELF ON?
WITHOUT POWER, OLD MAN ZORDON
WON'T BE BUGGING ME.
HMM.
COOL.
FREE TO DO WHATEVER I WANT.
WHAT I WANT
IS TO STAY CLEAR
OF YOU CLOWNS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY'RE NASTY
THEY'RE ALMOST CUTE.
WELL, ZORDON
IT'S ADIOS TO YOU, AND HELLO TO THE NEW
HATE-FILLED RANGERS.
WHAT ABOUT AISHA?
SHE COULD STILL SPOIL MY ANNIVERSARY.
ZEDD, YOU'D BETTER
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT RENEGADE RANGER.
DON'T WORRY.
IF HATE MASTER DOESN'T GET HER
THE OTHER RANGERS WILL.
I CAN'T WAIT.
AY-YI-YI!
IT'S NO USE!
I CAN'T RESTORE POWER TO THE MAIN GENERATOR
OR TO ANY OF THE BACKUPS.
AND THAT MEANS NO ZORDON.
ALPHA, DO YOU KNOW WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS?
NOT WHAT, WHO.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO'S FAMILIAR
WITH OUR ENTIRE COMMAND SYSTEM-
- BILLY.
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE COMPUTERS, DOESN'T HE?
YES, AND THAT MAKES HIM DANGEROUS TO US.
ALL THE POWER RANGERS ARE POTENTIAL THREATS NOW.
UNLESS WE CAN FIND AN ALTERNATE POWER SOURCE
I'LL BE UNABLE TO TRANSPORT ANYONE IN OR OUT.
WE'LL BE TRAPPED HERE FOREVER.
THIS DISGUISE IS NOT BAD.
POSING AS WAITERS GIVES US THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO STAKE OUT FOR THE GRAFFITI BANDIT.
( with French accent ):
RIGHT.
WHOEVER'S BEEN SPRAY-PAINTING WALLS
IS GOING TO BE NAILED.
YOU SAID IT.
COME ON.
IF WE DON'T GET HER HER ORDER, THAT LADY
IS GOING TO BLOW A GASKET.
CAN I AT LEAST GET SOME COFFEE?
MADAME, EXCUSE... ( screaming )
OH!
UH...
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE WITH YOUR PASTA?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LADY?
WE ARE SERVING YOU.
AND THAT'S GOOD.
EXCELLENT.
THE RANGERS' HATE IS SO GREAT
THEY'LL SOON DESTROY EACH OTHER.
YES.
VICTORY IS YOURS.
AW!
UGH!
UGH!
NOW THAT THE POWER PESTS WILL SOON BE
OUT OF THE PICTURE
WE CAN GO ON OUR HONEYMOON, ZEDDY.
BUT LIVER-LIPS, I'VE ALREADY GONE FOR ONE.
YOU CALL THAT A HONEYMOON?
!
GOLDAR SHOWED UP, AND I COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT SMELLING HIS STINKY MONKEY BREATH.
( growling )
BUT THERE'S MORE
TO BE DONE, MY APPALLING ONE.
SPEED THINGS UP!
I WANT TO GO.
HUH!
THE RANGERS
ARE NOT THE PROBLEM, SHE IS.
LET'S POISON THE ENTIRE WORLD WITH HATE
STARTING WITH ANGEL GROVE!
( laughing )
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.
IT'S AS GOOD AS DONE, ZEDD.
THINGS WILL BE REALLY GREAT
WHEN ALL THE LOVE TURNS INTO HATE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT F-F-FIRED.
SKULL, WE DUMPED
ERNIE'S LUNCH PLATE SPECIAL
ALL OVER THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE DIDN'T GET ARRESTED.
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE?
NO.
I AM SAYING
YOU SHOULD WATCH WHERE WE ARE GOING.
BULK!
LOOKY HERE, BIG ONE AND TWO.
I MIGHT AS WELL
START OUT WITH YOU.
YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS.
WELL, I'LL FIX THAT.
HEY, LOVE'S NOT COOL.
HATE'S WHERE IT'S AT.
THAT CARING, LOYAL GENEROSITY KICK--
WHY, THAT STUFF'S AWFUL.
IT MAKES ME SICK.
I'M SPREADING HATE THROUGHOUT THE LAND.
I LIKE TO HELP WHENEVER I CAN.
( laughing )
( moaning )
- HUH?
- HUH?
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I FIGURE IT OUT.
OH, YEAH?
YEAH!
YOU RIPPING OFF MY MOUSTACHE?
YEAH!
LORD ZEDD'S REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME, HASN'T HE?
YEAH!
I HATE HIM!
WAIT.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE WANTS.
I REFUSE TO HATE HIM
BUT, OOH, HE REALLY CHARGES MY CIRCUITS.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S IT!
WHAT'S IT?
HOW MUCH POWER WOULD IT TAKE
TO TELEPORT ME OUT OF HERE?
A MINIMAL AMOUNT.
AND IF I GOT OUT, I COULD FIND
WHAT'S BLOCKING THE POWER AND I COULD SHUT IT DOWN.
BUT AISHA, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE AMOUNT OF POWER TO TELEPORT YOU OUT.
OH, YES, WE DO.
YOU.
OF COURSE.
I'LL CONNECT MY CIRCUITRY INTO THE MAIN COMPUTER
AND USE MY POWER TO GET IT OPERATING.
EXCELLENT.
HEY!
MOVE IT.
I'M GOING TO WORK OUT HERE.
SORRY, PAL, BUT THIS AREA IS ALREADY RESERVED, FOR ME.
WHY?
YOU AREN'T ANY GOOD.
I SAY WE FIND OUT WHO'S THE BEST RIGHT NOW.
( laughing )
YOU'RE ON.
ALL RIGHT, I'M READY.
HERE GOES.
( jabbering )
IT'S WORKING.
YES, AND I CAN PINPOINT THE SOURCE
OF THE POWER BLOCKAGE.
IT'S COMING FROM THE JUICE BAR.
GET ME THERE AND I'LL SHUT IT DOWN.
BUT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER
TO GET ALL THE WAY TO THE YOUTH CENTER.
WELL, TELEPORT ME TO THE PARK
AND I'LL MAKE IT FROM THERE.
HERE.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.
WITHOUT YOUR NECKLACE
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE PROTECTED
FROM THE HATE MASTER'S EVIL PARTICLES.
IF I CAN RESTORE POWER TO THE COMMAND CENTER
YOU'LL NEED MY NECKLACE TO BLOCK
THE HATE MASTER'S SPELL ON THE RANGERS.
YOU'RE A REAL POWER RANGER, AISHA.
TELEPORTING NOW.
YES!
SHE'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.
TENGAS!
COLLECT THE SOIL SHE TOUCHES
AND GIVE IT TO HATE MASTER.
TENGAS!
I NEED NINJA RANGER POWER NOW!

# WATCH THE TENGA, WATCH THE TENGA... #
I WISH I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HERE.
HEY, YELLOW RANGER, WE FINALLY MEET.
MY UNFRIENDLY TENGA GOT THE STUFF FROM YOUR FEET.
THE EARTH THAT YOU TOUCH, I NEED TO COLLECT IT
SO THE HATE THAT I MADE
COULD BE PERFECTED.
I ROLL IT IN MY HANDS TO GET THE RIGHT DOSE.
NOW EVERYTHING YOU LOVE, YOU SEE, WILL REALLY BE GROSS.
BREAKING YOU DOWN IS PART OF THE PRODUCTION.
JOIN YOUR RANGER FRIENDS ON PATH OF SELF-DESTRUCTION.
NO...
COME ON, YELLOW RANGER, YOU CAN'T RESIST YOUR FATE.
SURRENDER RIGHT NOW AND GIVE IN TO THE HATE.
GIVE IN TO THE HATE!
( laughing )
OH!
I WON'T LISTEN TO YOU.
THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE YOUR PERSISTENCE.
THE SOUNDS THAT YOU HEAR ARE THE CRACKS
IN YOUR RESISTANCE.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
YOU'LL LEARN TO HATE.
YOU'LL LEARN TO HATE.
THE YELLOW RANGER
WILL SOON BE UNDER THE HATE MASTER'S SPELL
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THEM ALL.
MY LITTLE KIWI, VICTORY IS WITHIN OUR GRASP.
YES, OH, WICKED HUSBAND.
WITH THE RANGERS OUT OF THE WAY
AND THE WORLD IN HATE-FILLED TURMOIL
WE WILL PROCLAIM OURSELVES RULERS
AND MAKE THE EARTHLINGS
OUR SLAVES.
( laughing )
FORGET GOOD THOUGHTS.
THINK ONLY BAD.
IT'S HARD TO BE HAPPY, BUT IT'S EASY
TO BE MAD.
NO, DON'T GIVE IN.
WOULD YOU GIVE IN ALREADY?
DOING THIS IS NO SNAP.
IT REALLY ISN'T EASY TALKING ALL THE TIME IN RAP.
THINK GOOD THOUGHTS.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE STRONG AND CONFIDENT INSIDE
AND RISE ABOVE IT ALL.
AND REMEMBER, LOVE CONQUERS ALL.
LOVE CONQUERS ALL.
HUH?
HOW CAN THIS BE?
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?
I WON'T LET HATE CONTROL ME.
MY GRANDMOTHER TAUGHT ME THAT.
WILL YOU STOP ALL YOUR HARPING?
I NEED TO GO REST.
I NEED TO RECHARGE.
SEE YOU LATER, POWER PEST.
HUH?
UGH!
AISHA SENT THE HATE MASTER PACKING.
NOW SHE'S GOING TO DESTROY ALL OUR WORK.
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO SIT THERE?
I SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM.
HUH!
YEAH.
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?
COME ON, MAN.
ADAM, TOMMY, NO!
VIOLENCE DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT ATHLETES WITH AWESOME SKILLS
BUT THOSE SKILLS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO HURT EACH OTHER
OR ANYONE ELSE.
IT'S A GIFT
AND SHOULD BE USED ONLY IN SPORT...
WITH HONOR AND DIGNITY.
YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS.
WE ALL ARE.
WHY SHOULD WE HATE EACH OTHER?
IT'S SUCH A WASTE.
AISHA?
YEE-HA!
AISHA MUST HAVE GOTTEN
THE JAMMING DEVICE BACK FROM BILLY.
ZORDON, YOU'RE BACK.
AISHA DID IT.
GOOD WORK, BOTH OF YOU.
I CAN USE AISHA'S NECKLACE
TO CREATE A POSITIVE ENERGY BEAM WHICH WILL COUNTERACT THE HATE.
THE LONGER THEY REMAIN UNDER THE SPELL
THE HARDER IT IS TO BREAK.
LOOK AT YOUR BUMBLING BEAST, ZEDD.
WE'RE LOSING.
HUH!
MINE?
IT WAS YOU WHO WANTED TO CREATE THE HATE MONSTER.
WHATEVER.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THOSE POWER PUNKS FROM WINNING.
QUIT WHINING AND HELP ME MAKE THE MONSTER GROW.
WHOA!
HEY, GO FIGURE, I'M 30 STORIES BIGGER.
MY SENSORS TELL ME AISHA IS TRYING BUT HASN'T
COMPLETELY BROKEN HATE MASTER'S SPELL ON THE OTHER RANGERS.
THE POSITIVE ENERGY BEAM IS READY.
COMMENCE BEAM SEQUENCE, ALPHA.
YES, ZORDON.
I HOPE THIS WORKS.
LET'S KEEP OUR CIRCUITS CROSSED.
PLEASE, YOU GUYS.
WE GOT TO TRY REALLY HARD TO GET RID OF HATE.
IT'S NOT EASY, I KNOW
BUT YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER?
HUH?
HEY, SHUT UP!

UGH!
THEY ASKED HER TO RESIGN.

SO ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?
WELL, ONLY IF MY BEST FRIEND WILL JOIN WITH ME.

But I'm not fat anymore.
Well, we're still going to beat you up.
No, Bruno, that is not our way.
We only beat up those with obvious flaws.
Say, do you chaps have any vicks vaporub?
I have a cold upon my chest.
(Boy) Stop!
You're soiling my dickey!
[Gasps]
[All sighing]
3 different girls asked me to Friday's dance.
I never knew all the pressures of being popular.
Believe me, I know what it's like to be popular.
Oh, my God!
There's a message on my answering machine.
Oh, who could it be?
No one ever calls me.
(Jean Paul) Hello, Jay.
This is Jean Paul lepope, and I'm going to kill you.
It's 11:30.
Time for Marty to drink his diet coke.
[All sighing]
[Gulping]
(Alice) I should call the police.
Jay's received 2 death threats from Jean Paul lepope, and a dead fish wrapped in a newspaper.
Hey, where's the fish?
[Slurps]
Mmm.
Now, don't you worry, honey.
I know how to handle situations like this.
I bought Jay some protection.
[All grunting]
This is my posse.
They're gonna be protecting my own bad self.
Yeah, we tight.
I pity the fool who messes with the "j" team.
I'm cool.
I'm cool.
Dukey-Duke don't dis a man when he's chillin' with his homies.
(Principal on p.A. System) Auditions for Peter Pan are being...
[Squeaky voice] Held in the auditorium.
[Normal voice] Stupid helium.
[As marlon brando] I will take the part of Peter Pan but only for $1 million.
Also the part of captain hook must be played by my good friend, Ben gazzara.
[Groans]
(Marty) Ow!
Marty, what are you doing here?
I'm hiding from those girls who won't leave me alone.
And I'm hiding from those ruffians who wish to manhandle my dickey.
They've already kicked my ascot.
Don't you recognize me, Marty?
I used to be Julie Bolen.
You were "swollen Bolen"?
Yes, but that's behind me.
I lost weight and changed my name to Julie pimplepuss.
Uh, that's a pretty name.
But I wanted to give you a warning:
Stay thin.
People only like someone based on how they look.
That's not true.
People have just discovered the real me, that's all.
Hello, handsome.
How'd you like to star in the play?
Me?
But I can't act.
[Laughs]
That's what the young Steve guttenberg told me and look at him now.
Uh, no, look at him 4 years ago.
We've found our Peter Pan!
Hey, wait a minute.
Where's the rest of my posse?
They left for their own sitcom on fox.
Ah, yes, sweet, nonjudgmental fox network.
Where coming in 3rd is a triumph!
[Gasps]
[Footsteps approaching]
Hello, Jay.
Lepope!
Prepare to meet your fate.
[Gun clicks]
Oh, my God.
My life is flashing before my eyes.
[Crunching]
Ah, prom night.
Please don't kill me.
Please, please, please, please.
Jay, you think I'm going to kill you?
Yes.
[Lisping] Then I must be one fantabulous actor!
Gotcha!
Wait... wait a minute.
You were just acting?
That's right.
Like most action film stars, I'm dainty as a doily.
Wow.
I guess I owe you an apology.
I'll tell you what.
I promise to give your next movie a good review.
Oh, good.
In my next film,
Joe piscopo and I play siamese twins, joined at the tongues.
It's called, [garbling]
Part ii.
[Groaning]
Oh, no.
Tinkerbell is dead.
Ow!
I made one-one in my tutu.
Oh, Martin, put down that cookie.
I chose you for your looks.
I'm no good.
Why don't you give my part to him?
I'd like to help you, but I'm auditioning for the part of the blarney stone in the St. Patrick's day pageant.
Whoa.
That guy's a rock.
(Marty) Dad, I can't take this.
I'm not a good actor and they won't let me eat.
Marty, don't worry.
You've got plenty of talent.
And remember, you don't have to listen to your stomach.
(Stomach) What was that hogwash you were feeding' the boy?
Nothing, master.
I...
I said nothing.
Very well.
Now dance for me.

(Marty) I'm so hungry.

Maybe a little knish you'd like to nosh?

Come up and sashimi sometime.
But don't eat me.
I'm only plastic.

[Barks]
Uh, I mean...

Must be strong.

We need somebody to eat 50 gallons of ice cream.
It's Jay sherman's kid.
We're saved!
Where could that Peter Pan be?
Perhaps Nana the dog could find him.
[Whistles]
Nana!
Bow wow.
This is so humiliating, playing a dog.
This biscuit is keeping my breath fresh, though.

It is I, the pixie, Peter Pan.
Oh, no, he's fat again!

I say, string him up by his grobjes!

(Jay) Oh, no!
[All murmuring]
I'm the freakin' building engineer.
Peter pancakes over here has damaged the roof unfixably.
The school must be closed for a month.
(Kids) Hooray!

THE HUNDRED AND ONE NIGHTS OF SIMON CINEMA
I can see, I can hear and I'm in my 100th year!
Are you sure this is good for the memory?
That's what they say, even doctors.
- What's going on?
- There's a movie shooting.
Movie, my ass!
I have a job, too.
Just a second!
We stopped shooting.
It's rolling, Mica!
Stop the traffic.
There is none.
- This is the chateau...
...Of the 100 and 1 Nights.
- Episode One:
- Monsieur Cinema.
First slate.
So you're the film expert.
But you're a student!
I'm doing an M.A., which means I already have my B.A.
Is this old Mr. Cinema a nice man?
What is this, a circus?
You will see for yourself.
He's my master.
A respectable man.
These movie mementos are impressive!
He's done it all:
Act, direct, produce...
He's a giant.
Know what I have to do, exactly?
You must speak to him an hour or two daily.
Or rather, nightly.
Movie lore relaxes him.
You will receive $ 100 a session.
Saturday is pay day,
Sunday is a day off.
Are you his secretary?
His polymorphous, polyvalent butler.
As long as you're polite.
Will you show me in?
The Master doesn't care for young ladies in trousers.
Is your hair long or short?
- Long.
- Very well.
Introducing Camille Miralis, your future film buff tutor.
Come in, young lady.
It was a joke.
The makeup was to frighten you.
You'll do fine.
We'll notify you by mail.
Mr. Cinema hereby hires you for 101 nights at $ 100 a session... 101 times $ 100!
An offer I can't refuse!
I'll get used to his mug.
The work we offer you is also a mission:
To keep alive the human symbol of cinema.
He thinks he's hot shit!
What about you, megaproducer!
That's different, I've got time.
You're in for it!
Look at Granny.
She's 92.
Always driveling and repeating herself.
I'm taking it.
$ 10,000 for three months!
It's all here:
The chateau is half a mile from the station...
That I know, I walked it.
What should I take?
Go the way you are.
Old-timers just like to ogle...
To babble on, and ogle.
Move it, if you want a lift!
I have a night shoot.
The suburban line will do just fine.
Movement is life, movement is cinema!
Some camera movements epitomize the cinema.
Like the opening of La Soif du Mal...
One single complex movement from when the bomb is set to its explosion.
Touch of Evil.
Original titles only,
- if you please!
- Sorry!
A sublime shot that lasts three minutes and contains the entire film.
Welles was a genius, a genius!
That's what they always say, because he started so young.
Your drops, Sir.
Still, Citizen Kane for a first movie...
That's tops, super, cool!
Is that how young people talk today?
I'm so old.
What did we use to say?
"Dazzling"? "Magnificent"?
And I forget what...
I was told you're only 100, or almost.
Your memory seems in great shape.
Wrong, my dear Camille.
May I call you Camille?
Wrong.
A) I have memories but I can't remember them.
As if I couldn't catch flies.
B) It's not a matter of age, but of memory.
I hired you to talk to me about film, my favorite passion.
C) I've lost the use of my legs.
I must keep my head busy, travel without moving.
And d)
I need your beauty to serve as my daily ray of sunshine, and I need your knowledge.
You shall be my evening amphetamine.
Mr. Cinema!
Mr. Firmin!
Nim, pillows!
Mr. Cinema, don't get carried away!
I hope I'll be helpful in your fly hunt.
Say, do you know the movie
Yoko Ono did with a close-up of a fly on a breast?
Marvelous!
Thanks for reminding me.
The change of scale is film magic.
The tiny woman in the hand of King Kong...
Fay Wray, that's right.
I loved that woman madly.
I laid my power at her feet...
My wealth, my madness!
I wanted to marry her.
That was when I managed the studios of MGM.
I'm the one who invented King Kong.
I thought it was David O. Selznick who produced it for RKO...
That's right.
I'm David O. Selznick.
Weren't you Hitchcock?
I'm Renoir, I'm Nosferatu, I'm Catherine Deneuve...
And now, I'm David O. Selznick.
I created three or four dream creatures who became tremendous stars.
My head's full of stars.
Faces, beauties...
Miss Ardant, they're waiting for you on the set.
Why didn't you knock?
Are you new here?
I'm an intern.
- I forgot my shawl.
- I'll get it!
Beauty shall be convulsive or nothing.
If only you'd worn very high pointed heels
I could have drunk champagne out of your shoes.
Say, Bob, don't you have to buy ball bearings in Billancourt?
Got the message, I'm off.
What an obstacle course!
It's even more of a dump than usual.
This isn't a movie studio, it's a flea market.
Leftovers from a shoot.
We kept everything.
It might come in handy.
You've prepared everything!
We'd have had time at my place.
Mylene comes home at 5.
A quickie, right?
I'm in no hurry.
- Seeing someone later?
- Of course not.
But quickies can be fun, too!
I always think you'd rather be elsewhere.
Don't be a jerk, Mica.
Let's go upstairs.
How about it, sugar?
Immediate boarding by the ramp!
Got the safes?
These are worth two weeks' pay and I don't even know the maker!
Get Camille to buy you a pair.
You're just jealous!
You think I earn too much for what I do.
Right on sight!
And me, not enough, hot stuff.
- Hi, gang!
- Hi, Sylvie!
Assistant-intern...
Why not gofer-lackey?
Never on the set and rotten pay...
I was an intern, too.
Serving coffee, holding cables.
Gotta go.
Nosferatu awaits me.
Is he a sicko or what?
It's okay now.
He's just real old and a bit batty.
But he has style!
The Lumiere brothers!
Ah, Mr. Marcello Mastroianni, what a pleasure!
I like calling on my friend.
That way everyone's happy.
How is the old man?
Long live Commedia dell'arte!
Meet the famous, enlightening Lumiere brothers.
My friends Auguste and Louis, this is Vittorio Gassman.
It's Marcello, ninny!
If you go gaga, I'm leaving.
Just teasing!
You didn't fall for it, you flew for it, like that belle who made you run, fly and crawl...
Which belle?
I've skipped from belle to belle.
Show-off!
You had some real dogs, too!
Like Simonetta with those boot-button eyes, and that slow-witted Irina, whom you kept like a spare tire.
For someone who's senile, you have a convenient memory.
Actually, I'm in treatment.
Ayoung beauty is having my memory do aerobics.
- What's all this?
- It works!
That was my great idea:
The old goat gets himself a nanny.
A student.
A student?
She's always at the Cinématheque or the Museum.
Speaking of Muses...
Good evening, dear Camille.
'Evening, Mr. Marcello Mastroianni.
I'm so glad to meet you.
Me, too.
He was just talking about you.
He knows I saw all his films?
Does he know I saw all his films?
That's enough!
Get me out of here!
Ah, the harem bath in 81/2!
A thief!
That Fellini was a thief!
That was me in the bath wearing a hat and even smoking a cigar.
I like you better without the hat and cigar.
It's to be like Dean Martin in Some Came Running.
Did you see Godard's Contempt?
Well, I'm Piccoli.
I was the one in the movie with Bardot.
I was imitating Dean Martin.
No, Godard was imitating Fellini.
I was the one the producer wanted in the role.
Piccoli copied me.
Look, you're the one who duped me.
Anyway, I was Jean-Luc.
I'm drowning here.
Who is who?
This reminds me of a Prévert poem:
Actors aren't people.
They're at once everyone and no one.
Thank you.
She's spunky.
I like that.
She's a film buff.
I like that.
As for the two scenes in question, you're right and wrong.
Both were shot in Rome in the summer of'63.
When Godard shot you in the bath, it was in July, in a flat in Rome.
When Fellini filmed you in the baths, it was in September, at Cinecitta.
Let's not lose the focus.
Focus on me, instead.
You deserve your degree, Miss.
Shall I call you Diplomata or Dottore?
Please call me Camille.
I'm doing a thesis.
You're a big part of it.
It's about the myth of the seducer.
I'm just a moth-eaten seducer, a tired hero, an over-the-limit Latin lover.
That's not true!
- I saw you in Verso Serra.
- In the evening...
That reminds me, Mr. Cinema...
It has to do with these 101 nights...
Can I come during the day...
From 5 to 7?
Of course.
The magic hour for lovers.
Don't worry.
You're safe with him.
But with me...
The Latin Lover may still strike.
Not him!
I'm the one she asked for the 5 to 7.
The answer is yes.
It's his come-on.
I'm an old Latin Lover.
That way they'll say:
Oh no, you're still magnificent!
Me, me, me!
I'm happy just to hear:
Bravo, thanks.
Grazie.
That's all.
You want sophisticated compliments.
Mr. Cinema deserves them.
He embodies all cinema.
He's a consummate man.
Oh, Mr. Cinema, you're terrific!
You'll drive me crazy!
What movie is this?
An entertaining one.
A divertimento.
The slate, boy!
Slate!
End of Episode One.
Episode Two.
A Million, the Wind, Love and Death...
- The format doesn't matter to me.
- But my having talent does!
Just another guy trying to impress his old lady.
Who's an old lady?
!
The problem is shooting a demo reel
- to find a million.
- Clair's Million!
- Attaboy, Gaston!
- A million!
A million!
Then find me a winning lottery ticket!
I'd film the gangland killing first.
- Got a cast?
- We're the cast.
Bob, you'll play a drag queen.
Not me!
I play me, or Groucho!
- Don't imitate.
Create!
- A new wind.
After the New Wave, the New Breeze.
You're creating a draft.
Who said that?
I know.
I'm an Arletty fan.
Garance...
I desire you, that's all.
But I have my pride.
Your head is too hot, Pierre-François, and your heart too cold.
I'm sensitive to drafts.
Ah, The Children of Paradise!
I dare you to repeat my heart's too cold.
I dare you to deny you desire me.
I won't deny or decry it.
Let's keep it vague.
Shall we go?
- You weren't at Mr. Cinema's?
- I work days now.
Now it's 1001 afternoons.
101...
If I keep him alive that long, I get a bonus.
A bonus, too!
What a great boss!
I have an idea:
I could film him.
In close-up.
Set it up for me.
Don't run like that, Miss.
You could hurt yourself.
I like to run and I'm late.
The station's a way off.
Want to borrow a bike?
- That'd be nice.
- I have two...
Mrs. Simone's old one, and Monsieur Vincent Jr.'s.
He's on the run too.
- Who is?
- The great-grandson.
He goes jogging?
Haven't seen him in a long, long while.
You the storyteller?
- In a hurry?
- I hate being late.
As long as you come, he's happy.
- But he has other visitors.
- Of course.
Colleagues.
But not his great-grandson?
Who told you about him?
Friends who know him...
Knew him...
People.
I never saw him.
He may come when I sleep.
The Master gets very little sleep.
He says he sees ghosts.
The Lumiere brothers!
He told me.
They drop by from time to time.
It's me.
Excuse me.
I'm eating.
I was afraid you wouldn't show.
I was down in the dumps.
I was afraid night would fall and melancholy with it.
Come now...
Who and what do we talk about today?
Renoir?
The Popular Front years?
No, I was thinking of the fellow with the big eyes.
Buster Keaton?
Keaton, not today.
Bunuel.
That eye slashed in two.
Bunuel is the standard.
He was my friend.
We were the same age.
We belonged to the same Surrealist group with a naked woman in the center.
And we closed our eyes.
You're too far.
Come sit here.
Show me some pictures.
Look at this one...
Louise Brooks.
She's beautiful.
She started when she was 15.
She wasn't much of a talker.
She used to read Schopenhauer.
I was Pabst.
I thought of playing the role, a whip in one hand, a revolver in the other!
I haven't introduced myself.
Always the first.
At your service.
I'm a magician!
I had such magnetism, that compass needles went wild and clock hands stopped dead.
I never wear a watch.
Time is on my side and I have no home.
I was always on the big side.
So was Falstaff.
Citizen Hearst was a big press baron.
When I made Citizen Kane in '34, I was 23, and Lulu was singing and dancing in a nightclub.
My dear sir, that was in '41 and Welles was 25.
And the woman in the nightclub was Susan Alexander.
You know what Cocteau said about you...
About Welles:
Orson Welles is a baby-faced giant, a tree full of shade and birds, a dog that has broken its chain to go sleep in a flowerbed.
I'd like to be a big dog in a woman's bed.
It's to make my extravagant mistress Lea Padovani happy that I sleep in satin sheets.
She writes me love notes on the mirrors.
She loves lace and rosy-pink satin.
And you're a rose bud, my dear Rosebud.
Perhaps you forgot or didn't know Rosebud was the pet name
Hearst used for the private parts of his mistress, Marion Davies.
So, please, don't call me Rosebud.
There are three vile, unbearable things in life:
Cold coffee, lukewarm champagne and hysterical women.
I'm very calm!
So don't call me Rosebud.
I don't want to die!
- This is not amusing.
- It sure isn't!
Can't we go in to say hello?
Not when the Master is receiving stars.
- Why not?
- They're drunk.
They might molest you.
Then I came for nothing!
Wait.
You'll still get paid.
It's visiting day.
He disappeared just like that?
He may not have been in the plane that crashed.
His parents were...
Who're you talking about?
Mr. Cinema's sole heir, Vincent.
He's missing.
He was on the reservation list but not the passenger list.
When was this?
- About 10 years ago.
- I'm not going to wait 10 years.
Nobody knows if this Vincent is alive?
If he was, he'd come milk his great-grandpap for some money.
He'll live until our next visit.
I'll go with you.
We'll talk on the way.
- I love disappearance stories.
- His estate's the talk of the town.
You don't look dead.
You're a solid old fart.
A solid fart.
Watch it.
Don't fart too hard!
Remember the way you died in The Grand Bouffe?
A grandiose backfire!
- Terrible death!
- Awful!
Took some doing.
It wasn't just sound effects!
A great way to go!
A poot's more original than a gat.
I've died by gunfire at least eight times.
In Barocco I had two roles:
The killer and the killee.
In another picture, I stuck a shotgun in my belly.
Let's roll!
Action!
Can't let you get stiff.
Make tracks, youngster!
You've rolled plenty!
Barroco and His Brothers...
The Satin Slipper...
It was your director who shut your eyes in the confessional.
That old devil Pialat!
Action!
My director had me slit my throat.
While I sang!
That old devil Demy!
And Danton's death...
Was the guillotine fun?
That gave me a scare.
My arms were tied behind my back,
I was laid out on a plank under a real 180-lb.
Blade that's held up by a little pin.
Imagine an extra going off his rocker...
I was really afraid of an accidental death.
Show my head to the people.
It's worth looking at.
You show yours to the people a lot.
I sure do!
If I stop, I die.
Stop playing senile.
Get up and walk!
In one picture I almost fell from a tower.
Another time, in Italy, I took a Leap into the Void.
You die plenty in movies!
Especially if you retake a scene 10, 20 times.
Death is bullshit!
I've been hung, electrocuted, burned...
I've died a thousand deaths.
I usually wind up getting shot.
I died laughing watching you croak in Uranus.
Berri wanted me to die to death!
I had a ball in front of the camera.
Everyone had a good laugh.
You could say we've looked death in the face.
Look death in the face?
Then look at me.
I am Death.
That's not civilized.
It's rude.
Not proper.
In Orpheus Casares didn't say anything.
I speak as I wish and brandish my scythe.
All is lies, all is truth.
I come, I go, in disguise.
Your days are numbered, I'm counting.
- Conservatory?
- Private classes?
She's good.
I've seen plenty of girls try to audition in my dressing room.
Sit down...
Miss?
I have no name.
She knows her part:
Nameless, shameless Death.
You're after famous names in your autograph book...
We can help you.
Strange notebook!
Dates... names... in columns...
Looks like a directory.
This notebook is mine alone, its meaning ineffable.
- What a fable!
- And if she was amiable...
Play!
Play!
Flirt!
Trifle with me!
She'll recite Death is nothing to trifle with.
That's right.
She knows the day and the hour.
What?
Who?
What's that?
Her?
You?
Who?
Come off it, kid, who you kidding?
Champagne?
Came from Paris by train?
Walk across the plain?
That's it, champagne.
No visitors today.
I'm all alone.
Camille didn't come.
Nobody except that actor...
Gérard...
What was his name?
Oh, yes.
Gérard Philipe, the star of Fanfan the Black Tulip.
No, it was Black Moonlight...
Gone with the Window.
Now I remember:
Gérard Phoenix... in My Own Private Idaho.
Take a deep breath.
Come on...
Open your eyes.
You okay?
Okay...
You gave me a fright, Baby Doll.
Where'd you get your sexy nightie?
- Rue de la Ga^ité.
- That's gay.
I was imitating Arletty in Hôtel du Nord, and River Phoenix.
Don't ever pull that again!
Get dressed.
You're not narcoleptic and River Phoenix is dead.
I know.
I was gathering info on Arletty for tomorrow.
You put yourself out for the old man.
- Know what I found out?
- I couldn't care less!
No, wait!
This is an awesome plan.
And it could be a juicy one.
The old man has a great-grandson who disappeared.
His sole heir.
Maybe we can help find him.
How could we?
By inventing one!
A stand-in.
To get to the jackpot.
Have a photo?
Will I have the honor and benefit of playing the hypothetical heir?
Especially the benefit!
You're 10 years too young.
I saw some of his letters.
You've been prying?
Sure!
I learn lots of stuff.
I showed him an envelope.
He said:
He wrote again.
My Vincent will be back.
What a convoluted story!
You weenie!
If we pull this off, everybody stands to gain.
Especially you.
For your movie.
And to spoil you, my queen.
Slippers!
Right away, my queen.
And tell that shrew Renée to do the room at 3.
Yes, my queen.
When I was young I played broad games, not board games!
Movie gossip is often just a lot of negative clichés.
What's he staring at me for?
Yes, why is he staring at us?
Kiwei!
- Tell that fellow to stop staring!
- We're not in a showcase.
To clean the outside windows, he can't turn his back.
Have him clean inside.
Come in.
I thank this wind that's allowed me to approach my idol.
I saw La Dolce Vita as a kid.
It changed my life.
I learned you can look like a tango dancer and still feel the confusion felt by the meek, the lowly, the subordinate.
- He talks like a book.
- Like a chatterbox.
Let him speak!
Go on...
For me, you're Number One, even in Leo the Last.
Your British cool worked wonders.
Allow me.
I admire your elegance in La Notte, your licentious airs in Flight to Varennes.
May I?
Show this gentleman to his ladder.
This meeting will illumine the second part of my life!
Did you fly away?
I'm here.
A fan.
Know where the word comes from?
Fanatic!
A nutcase!
If he were your fan, you wouldn't say that.
You're just jealous!
Me, jealous?
I've had it all.
Prizes, honors, presents!
Jealous...
I think he's a pleasant young fellow.
You take me for a buffoon.
I'm a sensitive man.
You won't give me your films and rights.
But he gave me his sponge.
How nice.
I'll give it to my mother.
You're a sensitive man.
I'm so fond of you.
The old man's old and stingy.
I'll buy you anything you want.
You'll be my queen.
Don't climb!
Mr. Vincent Jr.
Used to climb, too.
He'd shout:
Hey, Sylva the forest, Sylvestre the forester!
Come down!
Come down, child!
You're both here...
Hanna Schygulla and Jeanne Moreau.
Jeanne and I met at a dinner the other night.
The patriarch's two wives.
We had a good laugh.
We plotted this surprise.
Say, you're not both here for your alimony?
I haven't got a thing.
I'm just a poor, penniless old man.
Simon, you haven't changed.
Haven't changed a bit!
- What continuity!
- As stingy as ever!
We won't take the money and run.
Excuse me for receiving you in bed, my darlings.
Come sit by my side.
Come!
Here...
No, here.
You've always had a seductive gaze.
The German woman's gaze.
And you've always amazed me.
As empress or chambermaid...
She also played Queen Margot.
My very own queen...
And you as Effi Briest.
As the Holy Whore.
And you in The Immortal Story by Orson Welles.
Orson stole you from me, my Nanette.
I hate him!
You broke my heart by falling for that leather punk Fassbinder.
Be quiet, Simon.
She did lots of pictures with him.
When a director does several with an actress, they form a couple.
A creative couple.
Antonioni and Vitti...
Bergman and Liv Ullmann.
Demy and Deneuve.
- Godard and Karina.
- Sternberg and Marlene.
Cassavetes and Gena.
Panfilov and Churikova.
Truffaut and you.
I directed you, too.
But only once each!
I married each of you.
Big deal!
The Marriage of Maria Braun went sour... and sometimes The Bride Wore Black...
Who's your next victim?
Still jealous at your age!
What is there without love?
Hanna...
Did you ever truly love me, simply, gazing in my eyes, without doing your number?
Is anybody out there?
Tea and crumpets.
And chocolate.
All women love chocolate.
Lackey!
Clown!
Your Love is Colder than Death!
I'm going to direct my third film, you know.
- You?
- You dislike female expression?
- Mise en scene?
- Ms. En scene!
Are you here to hold a press conference?
Or to criticize?
- We wanted to surprise you.
- Surprise me?
To astonish you.
As surprises go, it's an unpleasant one.
Oh really?
You're not two Graces, you're two Fates!
The third is coming for you very soon.
She'll be less beautiful and much uglier than us.
Curtain!
End of Episode Two.
Episode Three:
The return of the Vincents.
Hey, Mica...
- Waiting for us?
- Sure I was.
This is my brother.
- Was he in hiding?
- No, abroad.
- Where?
- India.
Is he dumb?
You autistic or was your tongue cut out?
I'm so glad.
I found a two-day job on a shoot.
Nice!
Should I babysit him?
My name's Vincent.
Camille.
We call him Mica.
To tell me apart from my girlfriend Camille.
Mica.
Beautiful as a deity.
One of those 12-armed things?
I'm not into Hinduism.
Except Lang's Tiger of Bengal and The Thief of Bagdad by...
I forget.
Coming?
Like Scorsese?
Except that you end the shot on the body riddled with bullets... and then to the Ferrari.
Will you be home tonight?
I'm sleeping at Mica's.
Okay, but you won't have a crane.
Or a Steadicam.
- Can you take the trash out?
- Sure thing.
I hear he did 3 three-month stints in a Buddhist monastery.
He got fed up with silence and celibacy.
- Did Marco tell you that?
- He told Bob.
He'll be a hit!
Buddha and Co.
Are in style.
Sure.
The return to values...
And the red ribbon for AIDS, and Sarajevo...
And the homeless sell, too.
I'm hungry.
Feed me.
Princess, will you do me the honor of supping with me?
You seem elsewhere.
Do you hear other voices?
Mr. Cinema!
That's Sandrine Bonnaire.
I recognized her.
I just love her.
You feel she understands plain folk.
She's so beautiful.
Beautiful as a landscape.
Beautiful as can be.
- I was waiting.
- Why the wheelchair?
Get a load of this!
I bet your old man can't do this one.
Show-off!
- Pretty dress!
- I've been buying clothes lately.
I need air!
I've been slaving away.
I finished my shooting script.
Short subject, long title:
The Flower of Blood or Make 'Em See Red.
Any coffee left?
I describe a cut and blood spurts.
Say, you're all red, as lovely as an open wound.
Look at this!
A real storyboard.
Listen!
I missed Depardieu, I missed Sandrine Bonnaire but not Anouk Aimée!
Not interested in hearing about my film?
Depardieu...
You're caught up in the Star System!
He's my favorite.
You didn't tell me!
Why should I?
You never listen anyway.
I told you I missed Depardieu but I saw Marcello courting Anouk Aimée in the park.
He looked superb in a black cape like Mandrake.
Want to make la dolce vita with me?
Oh, no, Marcello.
I just came to intervista you as Mandrake.
Do a trick for me.
I'm so tired, Anouk.
My disciple performs for me now.
So long.
Did you talk to Anouk Aimée?
It didn't go so well.
She took me for a schemer.
You are!
Take me along.
You're paid like two people.
It'd be good for me, and I'd keep an eye on you.
I'm the one with the job!
I go alone, I collect alone.
If I scheme, it's to get the estate.
It might work.
He's gullible and hungry for love.
Why can't I come?
You've been a snotty, secretive flirt since you met that old man.
- Push me.
- What for?
We're going to do a Raoul Coutard traveling shot in a wheelchair.
We do a slightly low-angle close-up of the snotty star who also doubles as the grip.
He's really into "mise en obscene".
And you're a slut.
Cut it out!
You're jealous because I meet stars.
That's right.
You're a fine driver, Firmin.
The Rolls is rusting.
What a shame!
We'll go out driving one day.
I'll be Gloria Swanson, you'll be Max...
Von Stroheim, I mean.
You up front, me behind.
Madame will pardon me:
The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Thank you, Max.
You're great in Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Gloria Cinema!
I knew Gloria well.
She was glorious!
She never wore the same dress twice and had a 32-room mansion!
- Mr. Gillette's house.
- Like the razors?
That's right.
Every time I shave, I think of Gloria.
That was long ago.
I'm Monsieur's barber now.
- A barb in my side!
Leave us.
- Will you push the Master now?
Push me inside!
He always wants me to take the air.
I hate air!
I only like light, or great open air...
Adventure!
In a mood to travel?
Yes, far away, incognito...
Departure and homecoming.
Coming Home was my professor's favorite theme.
What?
Who?
Jean-Claude Romer.
First postulate:
He who returns should never have returned.
He's often a hell-raiser or a swindler...
Like Charles Boyer in Gaslight.
But homecomings can be happy!
The amnesiac...
Travis in Paris, Texas, searching for his wife and son.
We always await the return of our kin, our great-grandchildren.
Not so sure!
There's Joseph Cotten's return in Shadow of a Doubt... a criminal hiding out with relatives.
And that fake Martin Guerre...
Those who come home aren't all impostors!
When I said Those who come home aren't all impostors, my knees turned To jelly!
You and your plot!
Here come the brothers!
Joining the ranks of decadent youth, blessed Buddhist?
Look, Camille, I left the monastery.
I'm not in a trance, got that?
10 years must've left traces!
What's left may not be for you, my lovely lotus flower.
It's Sunday!
How about casting an heir?
That's top priority.
Here we have a guy who split for 10 years who's cut out for the part!
Want some pizza?
No pizza.
He's perfect.
Just the right profile, and his name's Vincent like the other one!
True, he's just right.
Are you up for being reincarnated as an heir, and splitting the dough with us?
- The geezer isn't dead yet.
- Soon enough.
Got any pictures from India?
A degree in meditation?
Monasteries don't give college credit.
We need proof you were there.
I've got your fake parents' family papers.
It was in a handbag at the old man's place.
- Say you retrieved it after the accident.
- What accident?
A plane crash, 10 years ago.
I'll explain...
Laurel and Hardy.
They're a riot!
It's not for a lark.
We need money to shoot.
- Take an oath!
- For what?
That what Mr. Cinema leaves you goes into a feature film.
That you'll sell the chateau if you inherit it.
The rest of you, swear to secrecy.
I swear, I swear...
We swear, too.
Shit!
Shit, if we had that much money, are you sure you'd have ideas worth spending it all on?
I don't know.
I feel so shabby!
No, more like a kid.
Think of Spielberg, Coppola, Polanski, Godard, when they started out.
Even bad directors...
Cut it out, Camille Thibault!
That's nothing new.
Like Herzog said:
Even Dwarfs Started Small.
Mr. Cinema...
Someday my prince will come.
Someday Vincent will come back.
Sylvester?
I'm so glad to see you.
Don't you recognize me?
Wait a sec...
Salve Silva.
It's Mr. Vincent!
What d'you know!
I'm just back from India.
We thought you were dead!
How's Madeleine?
- And the girls?
- Married.
- How long's it been?
- 10 years.
- Awful accident!
- I've been an orphan for 10 years.
Poor fella!
You've changed a bit.
Seen Grandpappy?
My Grandpapyrus?
I'm afraid it may be a shock.
Go in with me.
I rarely go in so I don't track in dirt.
But this time...
True, you used to call him Papyrus, so I thought he was a Russkie!
- Maxime still around?
- No, now he has Firmin.
- And a yellow servant you never met.
- Yellow?
Two girls:
One's from Nimes, the other's from China.
I can feel it!
Visitors!
The Lumiere brothers are here!
Visitors, at last!
Look!
The audience is a doubting Thomas, believing only what they see.
The audience loves excitement.
Sugar?
A bouquet, how nice!
You're just in time.
Guess who's here?
Vincent.
I've never mentioned him.
He's the last of the line.
- Still have family?
- A great-grandson.
- A Ghost from the Past.
- A Louis Jouvet movie!
That's when he said:
Stop playing the fool, you moron!
Say hello, Vincent!
I'm no movie maven but Papyrus doesn't care.
I know other things.
What do you do?
And why call him Papyrus?
He went on a retreat to India.
He's a wise man now.
Because he's old and precious.
Shall I leave you?
No, I'm leaving.
See you tomorrow.
Don't go.
- I'll leave you two.
- Don't leave.
- Mind if I walk around?
- You unlocked the gate!
I remember you, everything.
Remember Lost Horizon?
Frank Capra's paradisiacal valley:
Shangri-La!
Where you never grow old nor die.
Now that Vincent's back, I feel as if I had wings and I want to go to Shangri-la, beyond the Lost Horizon!
Am I dismissed then?
No, you stay on.
I want you near me.
We'll all go to Shangri-La.
Will you come back later?
Tomorrow?
Little rascal!
Those Hindus didn't change you any!
What?
Dance!
What could be better?
I hadn't seen you.
Hello.
He was napping.
Normal at his age!
He's the one who's senile.
He can't even remember we'd been chatting for the past hour.
Next chapter:
Musicals.
Ginger and Fred with Giulietta Masina and me.
He always has to steal the spotlight!
Here's a trivia question, gentlemen:
In which movie do the chorus girls form a swastika?
A great Mel Brooks picture where he sells more than 150% of a Broadway musical...
The title is...
We've seen some fly-by-night producers in our time!
More specifically, the title of their musical?
As musicals go, the absolute yardstick is...
During my MGM days, I danced with an umbrella.
So now you're Gene!
Gene's a genius!
There was that young fellow from Rochefort who hired me to tap-dance with some sailors.
You're quite charming, but your effect on my friend's memory aggravates his usual delirium.
She's all I have, besides Vincent.
You bastard!
What about me?
I come see you often!
Excuse me for excusing you.
Anyway, we have to finish our game of checkers.
I feel like an intruder today, and I have a headache.
Would you mind if I left?
Your piece is in danger.
It can move horizontally.
Hellzapoppin and Mary Poppins are in a boat...
You should consider my offer.
Give me your stock of prints and your rights.
I'll make them turn a profit.
For now, I'm winning.
I take your piece.
Trust me.
Give me your films.
We've been friends for ages.
Mary Poppins falls out...
Give me your films.
Who's left?
Hellzapoppin!
You're a good actor, you know!
Think so?
What a farce!
- He's the king of playback.
- Drop your things in my room.
- Isn't Camille back?
- Not yet.
So you're going to shoot your film?
- Happy?
- Yeah, a short.
Stéphane's doing the photography.
Isn't Camille here?
She's late.
Tell her I'll be home after the film.
It worked, guys!
Vincent was perfect.
He's now part of the old man's family.
We're in the money!
Now you won't have to kowtow to any producers.
Don't count your chickens...
Never learned that?
- Well, I don't care.
So long...
- Don't go, I'm starved!
I'm seeing a movie.
Anyone seen Marco?
Anyone seen Marco?
Incredible!
Like Grandpap, he still needs his kid brother!
- Cool it!
What'll we do?
- I'm outta here!
What's his problem?
Trouble in paradise...
I'm going with you!
Wait for me!
Wait for me.
I'm coming.
I'm not ready yet.
Firmin!
Kiwei!
Anyone might come in.
I'm in my stocking feet!
I thought I saw the girl in purple!
I thought I saw lovers.
I heard someone say How're the lovebirds?
I got scared:
Lovebirds are never okay.
One's always more in love than the other.
- How're the lovebirds?
- Just fine.
Put something on or we can't talk.
You want to talk?
Yes, I do.
Come here.
You know, sometimes...
Sometimes...
Sometimes I'm afraid.
I mean, I wonder...
You're afraid?
Camille...
Yes, Camille?
To think they call me Mica so people can tell us apart...
It's ridiculous.
We're so different.
You don't know, you don't feel it.
What don't I feel?
In film it's not easy to feel silence, time, and the movements of the soul.
Dreyer, Bergman, Bresson and Cavalier at times offered me a hand I wouldn't take.
I don't like what they call inner life, or death.
I understand.
Still go to movies?
No, I meditate by watching falling leaves or floating clouds.
The cinema of observation.
Is that all you do in life?
How old are you?
I'm going to try to adjust.
I need a bit more time.
I know I'm already 30 but... it's hard to adjust to the noise.
Down with cries, long live whispers.
I heard Mr. Cinema was ailing.
I came to pay my respects.
I couldn't call ahead.
I don't have his number.
We have no phone, sir, nor radio, nor television.
But we have you, as a guest!
Allow me to proclaim my boundless admiration!
You're my favorite!
Of all film stars, you are a constellation in your own right!
The cream of the crop!
May I see your master?
I've often thought of leaving Mr. Cinema's employ.
His health, not to say his moods, are so unstable.
But... may I make a confession?
I always told myself I'd remain with Mr. Cinema at least until the day
I'd meet Mr. Delon, my idol!
I'm very touched and honored, but would you mind announcing me?
Wait!
I've waited years for this moment!
Look at my book.
Please take a seat.
- Now what?
- Sit down.
My guest book.
Impressive.
The center page is reserved for you.
Please sign.
My name is Firmin Gauche.
Yes, sir, Gauche.
Just like the character you play in Red Sun.
Oh yes, that's right.
How kind of you.
I'm in raptures!
There, Firmin.
May I go in now?
I'm afraid Mr. Cinema is not at all well.
He instructed me to allow no one in.
No visitors.
I'm afraid I must show you back to your chopper.
But I wanted to...
Well, if he feels ill...
Give him my card.
Thank you, Firmin.
Alain Delon, within our walls!
Hello.
What an event!
- You a relative?
- I'm the prop of Mr. Cinema's old age.
I was hired to help him do memory aerobics.
He's not in shape today.
I couldn't see him.
Then I'm not staying.
I'm no nurse!
Is that yours?
- Ever flown in an insect like that?
- Never.
How about a maiden voyage?
Paris heliport in 5 minutes.
Great, I live nearby.
Greater still, if you take me away, if I dare say so.
Dare, dare!
- What's your name?
- Camille.
In truth, I say to you,
I'm more of a movie buff than I seem.
Renoir's The River, which he shot in India, is a highly bourgeois vision of a traditional society.
Whereas Satyajit Ray better captures basic values.
He refuses to confine things within boundaries.
But the most accurate vision in film is Godard's Sauve qui peut, la vie.
That Swiss has a way with words.
He talks like a book.
Sauve qui peut comma la vie.
It could have been Joy, or Heaven...
The film describes prostitution as a metaphor for the entire notion of business.
There's that, but not only that.
Something in the mind and body rises against repetition and nothingness.
I'd like something in my body to rise.
What was that?
War?
A helicopter?
The police looking for a fugitive.
I asked them to leave.
I'll have none of that here!
We know Mr. Cinema's tastes.
They are limited.
He systematically avoids thrillers and anything to do with drugs, pimps and gangsters.
Indeed!
What feigned ignorance!
There is such a thing as film noir, sir.
Le faucon maltais, En 4eme vitesse...
What about French thrillers?
The Samurai, Borsalino...
The Sicilian Clan.
Are you a Delon fan?
And proud of it!
If I had a real model plane...
If we had money and equipment...
We've seen the palace of Versailles and the chateau at Rambouillet.
We'll return to Paris and its Eiffel Tower.
But first a tour detour by way of a century-old cultural monument in human form:
Mr. Simon Cinema!
And here's his chateau where you'll see the Great Man in person.
Now for a lightning tour of the mini-museum.
Cameras and flashes are permitted, handshakes, too.
All right.
Onward...
No spitting or smoking.
Toilets are in the front hallway.
Japanese cinema has a long history, dating back to 1896, but Europeans only really discovered it in 1951 with Rashomon, the Golden Lion at Venice.
Slowly, film after film, the charm of sliding partitions took hold, as did the tea ceremony, court ladies in kimonos, the lives of ordinary folk, and Crucified Lovers.
I'll mention only certain milestone directors and a few landmark films.
You, here?
I bought a ticket like everyone else, to see the old man.
Then stand in line like everyone else!
- What do you want?
- A close look at you.
Close up, I'm a papyrus.
- He admires you as an illumination.
- Know him?
Sort of.
Just an eccentric.
What if I were your Death?
Not some young girl or femme fatale.
But what if I were Death, calling for you...
Camille!
Get rid of this lunatic!
That'll do!
Wait for me over there!
Careful of fragile objects!
Don't touch!
- Going back with them?
- I paid for a round trip.
We could walk back together.
You're on foot and my bike was stolen.
Italian neorealism strikes again!
I'll wait.
Scaring the old man relaxed me.
You beast!
You could've scared him to death!
Don't you want Vincent to get his estate for me?
We can't kill him!
Let him croak on his own!
Who needs that old relic?
Movies are as hardy as weeds, they grow everywhere!
- Are you hardy?
- You sure aren't!
You were to get him for my film but you're not even cut out to ask!
- After the scene you made?
- No need to say it's for me.
There you are!
- How were admissions?
- 38, and one non-Jap student.
The one who attacked me.
Punk!
Shall I dispatch to the next world a young man not part of yours?
Prévert!
What dialog he wrote!
That's for sure!
I must get back to my tourists and tell them about Prévert.
Glad to see you on form.
- Form of what?
- Why, you seem content.
Form and content, a debate even older than I am.
Sir, I have a request.
Friends - well, people I know - are planning to make a short film and want you in it.
Me, an acting comeback?
I want Mae West or Béatrice Dalle as my co-star.
Tits and ass!
What's the part?
An evergreen old man?
A Godfather, but a good guy.
An anti-Mafia mafioso who finances anti-drug dope.
I'll always be by your side.
Please say yes!
Then, would you play hostess for the garden party I'm throwing?
Actually, I'm renting my grounds to a charity organization that's covering the costs.
Sure!
So you'll say yes?
Yes, Camille dear.
- Your little caps are cute.
- And fitting!
Sabine Azéma!
A Sunday in the Country against AIDS!
Dear Irene, I'm Louis Ducreux and I say, Stay Young.
Sabine, let me introduce my tutor.
Look down there!
We're having a benefit for AIDS research.
Is that Liz Taylor?
In France?
My name's Marina and I'm Italian.
- Too bad!
- I knew it wasn't her.
Marvelous Liz Taylor!
Young ladies will be coming around.
Give generously.
Let Liz Taylor's image spur you on!
Look at me, think of her.
Reach into your hearts and pockets!
Marvelous Liz!
He may be rich, but stingy!
He's got lovely eyes, you know.
Yes, he's very attractive.
Who's attractive?
Careful now!
The Latin lover could strike again.
- Mandrake!
- Rabbit lover!
Anouk, you're mine!
You must be dreaming.
So am I.
We're playacting.
That's what we love to do.
Acting is feeling.
Dear Mr. Bunuel.
L 'Age d'Or.
I find all commemorations fallacious and dangerous.
What's the point?
Long live oblivion!
I disagree!
I'm tired of forgetting things!
I have no more memory, no more dreams, even!
So I use my imagination.
Have the waiter bring me a dry martini from the San José Purua bar.
I'll go myself.
C'mon, let's get out of here!
- May I come in?
- Liz!
I understand you're rich and generous.
Who told you that?
That's malicious gossip!
Liz, you're here.
Why does he call her Liz?
It's Marina Castelnuovo!
He's lost his marbles.
That Italian sure has great conversation pieces.
Money, solidarity...
Liz, you're the Madonna of diamond miners!
I reach out to you.
Be generous.
I'm asking you to.
Oh, Liz!
Money has powerful bonds with beauty.
Your beauty has always overwhelmed me.
Having goods is good, doing good is better.
All right, your cause will be the sole beneficiary:
My chateau, fortune, film rights, everything!
It's a pleasure to give it all away, it's like being in love.
Firmin!
Fetch me the lawyer sitting by the pond.
And some tea for Madam.
And wine for the miners!
The joy of your presence is well worth my will!
The legatee's name goes here.
You can't let him do this!
Yes, I can.
It's better this way, for him... and even for me.
He's happy.
I like the fellow.
Did you forget about our deal?
You're hopeless.
Our whole plan's ruined!
Sign here.
He signed his will.
What's done is done.
End of Episode Three.
Fourth and final Episode.
Cinema and its Myths, meaning:
Champagne, stars, festivals,
Hollywood, wealth, and the centennial of cinema.
- A little early to celebrate.
- I think so, too.
Ready on the set?
- Speed!
- Sound ready?
Action!
I dream of saying Action.
To friendship!
The soaps are the fuel of the film industry.
I agree!
It's elbow grease that grows the best dolly shots... like fertilizer grows the best plants.
How do you know that?
I was a dolly grip before I was a gardener.
I know what I'm talking about.
The setup for the famous dolly shot of "Weekend", that was me.
That Godard!
And that Truffaut, I did many dolly shots for him... and for the new wave guys!
Pan across the puddle until you come to the flower.
Let 'em drop!
Shit, it doesn't work!
It's a mechanical misconception.
You'll have to rise as the petals fall away.
What'd you say?
I hear M-G-M's made you an offer.
What'd you say?
The head of M-G-M...
He's looking for you.
I prefer the Columbia lady.
Anyone home?
A dormant memory is like a clawless lion, an extinguished fire.
A mind without memories is like a locked suitcase, a chandelier without light.
I'm the world specialist of withering memories.
Memoriabilist or memologist?
Quiet, patient!
Let science and occult forces do the talking.
Butler, you'll be my assistant.
It's a revolutionary method!
I'll hit a specific point in your recall zone...
For instance, a molecule will unleash a memory!
Ready?
Waste no time!
The treatment will be radical!
Our fairy, our Esmeralda, our Queen of Sheba:
Gina Lollobrigida.
- My better half, my medium.
- Really?
My better half!
As if I were his property!
Change your tune, because we're divorcing.
You'll remain my electric muse, my holy bread, my love, my jealousy.
He's possessive!
What about me?
Work your powers of possession on me.
Take me.
Back to work.
Butler, hook everything up.
Shoot another arrow into my patient's memory.
An impatient patient!
The divine Bardot, the Venus of St Tropez.
Women are desirable in general.
The lawyer confirms that our business contract is separate from our divorce.
Even when you're no longer my better half, we'll go 50/50 on profits from our sessions.
I break my marriage chains and my contract.
You break my chops!
You use me to seduce your patients.
They're so glad to see me they feel better.
Then it's you who gets the compliments, Mr. Professor.
I want 70%, not 50%!
A debate as old as the hills:
End vs. Means, Method vs. Results.
Your method has produced results for me.
And your wife's an angel, isn't she, Camille?
Sure, she is.
Excuse me, you'd make quite a decent assistant.
What do you say to 30%?
I'll think it over.
But I don't understand why you stopped acting.
I was on stage one night and my memory went blank.
So now I'm fascinated by other people's memories.
It takes a good actor to be a doctor.
Please go on with the treatment:
Two shots at once?
I'll pay double.
Two shots, two women.
Ay caramba!
Two more shots, two more women.
Your wife's got percentages on the brain but - dare I admit it?
-
I've long had you on my mind, before and after your reconversion.
Calm down, butler!
Sign my guest book.
The center page has always been reserved for you.
Some other time, mate.
What's going on?
Is the party over or just starting?
Where are you going?
You've been caught up in the Star System?
Going to the Cannes Film Festival?
With a divorcing couple?
No, you must go to Cannes with me!
With me, Simon Cinema!
And a few other stars.
And a gun, for Bob.
We'll do a few test shots with the paint ball.
Careful!
Oh, shit!
It's too pink!
You're right.
Lucky I prepared some normal blood bags.
Think it'll burst right?
You bet it will!
I'm an expert.
Don't overdo it!
Don't be stupid.
I'll find the dough!
You need a shirt.
We can see the blood bag.
Really?
Catherine!
I met them all through films, except you.
I held them all in my arms, except you.
I should've been your partner since the dawn of time.
Not Belmondo or Depardieu, not Perez or any of the others!
It's dark, the light is soft.
We got into the same boat.
Like others get into hot water.
Darling, did you turn off the gas?
Change the cat litter?
Put the mayonnaise in the fridge?
Recharge the batteries?
Did you set the alarm?
Jam the pantry window?
Bring your razor?
And I have the keys.
Great idea I had, this cruise!
It means so much to them to have you play in their short!
Are you angry?
I hate this chauffeur.
He's a lecher.
Beware.
I hate that creep but I still love Catherine Deneuve.
Sure you do.
Quick!
He's coming!
Your ersatz powder is wrecking our network!
We can still make a deal before the final shootout.
We'll beat you at your own dirty game!
My boys are eager because we kill drugs at the source!
Blood will flow if it must!
Back off!
Get lost!
The truce is up in one minute.
I don't collude with crime!
Hold it...
Cut!
That was fine, but your fast delivery took me by surprise.
Some voices never grow old.
You'll have to adapt.
Sure, but...
I know you!
- Not at all, it's just...
- What do you want?
We'll take it again.
If you could just enunciate a bit slower, please.
Enunciate?
I am!
Pretentious twerp!
It's all so corny.
What is this, a thriller spoof?
Even for the cause!
I'm practicing, doing my scales.
The music comes later.
Then I'll bowl you over.
Trust me.
For me, movies produce emotions that are new to me... sensations, substitutes for something else.
For instance, the dexterity of Bresson's Pickpocket thrills me like a sexual come-on.
Then I'll pick your pockets!
Speed!
Scene 24, Take 1.
Action!
Gimme 2.
We've got a surprise for you.
Hit it, Sylvie!
Poor fellow.
- He's dead!
- It's almost criminal.
It's all my fault.
Put him on the couch.
No, don't touch him.
- Quick, to the hospital!
- Not the hospital!
My Rolls, a suitcase, the Concorde, and off to Shangri-La!
Camille,
Vincent, I want to go to Hollywood!
I think it's flying too fast.
Think she's there yet?
Here at Trocaca...
- Trodero...
- Trocadero!
In Pa-Pa-Paris...
- To inaugugu-rate...
- A mo-monument.
According to our researcher here present, Ms. Miralis, the Lumiere brothers invented the cinematograph, but we must mention the many scientists who also invented the cinema:
Another pair of brothers:
The Skladanowskys.
We salute them all.
Let us pay tribute to them.
Yes, they deserve it.
It's time to cut my speech...
And this piece of film.
I'm so glad not to be among them.
I'm like Bunuel.
Down with commemorations.
Long live anarchy.
Down with speeches.
Long live desire.
You're vile!
Since you got back, I've been all over town looking for you.
I've been all over town, too.
I had appointments yesterday.
Here, presents for you.
A T-shirt.
Try it on.
A coffee!
Hollywood was something else!
Wild!
- Had fun?
- Yes.
He knows everyone there.
I'm completely out of it.
I've got...
What?
Jet lag.
I'm always sleepy.
Let's go take a nap.
Can't.
I have to take something to Mom.
Shocking pink.
Tonight, then.
When can I come over?
I need my sleep.
I'll call you tomorrow if you want.
I look like an idiot with this T-shirt and cap.
You're bullshitting me!
- Don't you like Micalifornia?
- You're bullshitting me.
I'd like my coffee.
I'd like my Camille.
Hear me?
And during the end credits his Italian friend pays a visit the chateau.
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.
I go through the same thing.
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
I've put on weight?
Did you want to...?
No, not weight.
More like insulation.
I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
Please?
Come on, let her do it!
All right.
If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Come here.
Come here!
Can't make hands meet!
The One Where Ross Finds Out
Let's do it!
What?
Nothing.
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.
It's cute!
And we're changing.
Come on, give me five more!
Five more!
Five more and I'll flash you.
One two two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
She's insane!
The woman is insane.
It's before work, after work, and during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Just tell her you want to stop.
I can't.
While she's out of work, I'm all she's got.
So that's why I was thinking maybe we could all pitch in and buy her her own restaurant.
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?
It was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.
Nice.
He still won't put out?
Nope.
Zilch.
Nothing.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No.
What do you mean?
He's not British.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't think that's the problem.
We went dancing the other night and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes...
I just definitely felt something.
But how much can you tell from a look?
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal.
Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh, Rachel!
Don't look.
What?
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.
You have a date?
Monica's setting me up.
What about Ross and...
What?
My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, you know, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.
You're okay about all this?
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
If you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right.
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Both of you?
Together?
It'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time.
Well, isn't that just lovely?
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Look at that.
I gotta go!
I got a date!
With a man.
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you, but this my first date since my divorce.
If I seem a little nervous I am.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Cats.
How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Maybe 15, 16 years.
Well, that's just great.
Cheers!
Right.
Clink.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's just...
It's this thing.
It's not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound...
He just started going out with her.
Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
Michael, let's talk about you.
So...
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
- So I figured it out.
- What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, you know what I said?
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really?
That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.
If you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
You're right.
You're right.
You are so "yum"!
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?
Fruit flies?
Thank you.
Would you like dessert?
No dessert.
Just the check.
Please.
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
But only because I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie.
Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?
Too late for that, man.
I've screwed this all up.
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
Closure!
That's what it is!
That's what I need!
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Hel...
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
- I'm talking.
- I see that.
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.
You're being a little weird about your phone.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
So good with people.
Machine.
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.
Ross!
Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you and your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
You see there, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Stop.
No, come on!
We can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board!
And how was the date?
I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I...
I feel like I dreamed about you last night but I don't remember.
There they are.
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
Who's Michael?
Oh, my God!
Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the...
You're over me?
Oh, God!
- You're...
- Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my...
You know I had...
You know?
Chandler told me.
When did he?
When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's...
Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've...
You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat!
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Thank you.
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
All right!
Way to go!
Yea, me!
So how did it happen?
I took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" and "Where is this going?"
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please."
Sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
This man is my god!
This one is cute.
Don't you think?
Yeah.
This one's cute and that one's cute and that one's cute.
They're all cute, they're kittens.
Let's just wrap one up and get the hell out of here.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, me, sure.
I know that this is a big step for us but I've got a feeling we're gonna be okay.
I know, I know.
Do you have any cats that are really old or incredibly sick?
Ross, I don't want one that's about to die.
Oh, see?
We should have worked that out before we came down here.
Okay, sweetie.
I'm gonna narrow it down to this one over here and this one with the stripes, okay?
You pick.
I have to pick?
Whichever one you want.
I don't know.
I mean, it's not that easy to choose.
I mean, both cats are beautiful and funny.
You know, I'm sure I'd be happy with either cat.
- Do you want to take both?
- Both?
I can't have two cats.
Joey's the kind of guy who could have two cats.
I didn't get a cat.
That's interesting.
No, it's not "interesting." It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
I was doing great before I knew about you!
You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before!
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés or Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.
I don't need your ship!
- Good.
- Good!
And you know what?
Now I got closure!
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out.
It's over.
No way!
With one pound to go?
Come on!
We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
What you gonna do, fat boy?
What?
Nothing.
Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well, no.
But I...
If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you...
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
For a little while.
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Stop.
No, come on!
We can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board!
And how was the date?
I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I...
I feel like I dreamed about you last night but I don't remember.
There they are.
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
Who's Michael?
Oh, my God!
Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the
You're over me?
Oh, God!
- You're
- Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my You know I had
You know?
Chandler told me.
When did he?
When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat!
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Thank you.
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
All right!
Way to go!
Yea, me!
So how did it happen?
I took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?"
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please."
Sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
This man is my god!
This one is cute.
Don't you think.
Yeah.
This one is cute, that one is cute.
They are all cute, they're kittens!
Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.
- Are you OK!
- Yeah, me, sure!
You know this is the big step for us, but I'm got feeling that will be OK.
I know, I know!
Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.
Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.
Oh, see?
We should have worked that out before we came down here.
OK, sweetie.
I'm gonna narrow it down with this one over here and this one with the stripes, OK?
- I have to pick?
- Whickever one you want.
I don't know.
I mean it's not easy to choose.
You know both cat are beautiful, funny.
You will be happy with either cat.
Do you want to take both?
I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.
I didn't get a cat.
That's interesting.
No, it's not "interesting." It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
I was doing great before I knew about you!
You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before!
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.
I don't need your ship!
- Good.
- Good!
And you know what?
Now I got closure!
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out.
It's over.
No way!
With one pound to go?
Come on!
We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
What you gonna do, fat boy?
What?
Nothing.
Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well, no.
But I...
If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you...
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.
I go through the same thing.
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
I've put on weight?
Did you want to...?
No, not weight.
More like insulation.
I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
Please?
Come on, let her do it!
All right.
If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Come here.
Come here!
Can't make hands meet!
The One Where Ross Finds Out
Let's do it!
What?
Nothing.
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.
And we're changing.
Come on, give me five more!
Five more!
Five more and I'll flash you.
One two two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
She's insane!
The woman is insane.
It's before work, after work, and during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?
It was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.
Nice.
He still won't put out?
Nope.
Zilch.
Nothing.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No.
What do you mean?
He's not British.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't think that's the problem.
We went dancing the other night and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes...
I just definitely felt something.
But how much can you tell from a look?
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal.
Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh, Rachel!
Don't look.
What?
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.
You have a date?
Monica's setting me up.
What about Ross and...
What?
My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, you know, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.
You're okay about all this?
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
If you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right.
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Both of you?
Together?
It'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time.
Well, isn't that just lovely?
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Look at that.
I gotta go!
I got a date!
With a man.
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you, but this my first date since my divorce.
If I seem a little nervous I am.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Cats.
How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Maybe 15, 16 years.
Well, that's just great.
Cheers!
Right.
Clink.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's just...
It's this thing.
It's not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound...
He just started going out with her.
Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
Michael, let's talk about you.
So...
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
- So I figured it out.
- What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, you know what I said?
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really?
That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.
If you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
You're right.
You're right.
You are so "yum"!
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?
Fruit flies?
Thank you.
Would you like dessert?
No dessert.
Just the check.
Please.
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
But only because I've been playing the movie "Diner" in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie.
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
Closure!
That's what it is!
That's what I need!
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Hel...
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
- I'm talking.
- I see that.
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.
You're being a little weird about your phone.
All right.
Fine.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
Machine.
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.
Ross!
Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you and your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
You see there, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.

If you say stop, then we stop.
Ha, ha, okay.
- Stop.
- No, come on!
We can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board!
[MIMICKING TRAIN WHISTLE]
Whoo.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Hey, Rach.
- Mm.
- Oh.
And how was the date?
- Ugh.
Um, I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Wow.
Well, uh...
Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say?
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Heh.
Ahem, I'm sorry.
I don't know, I...
I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I don't remember.
Okay.
Heh.
Oh, oh, oh.
- There they are.
- Ahem.
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
- Huh.
- Oh, I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
- Who's Michael?
- Oh, my God.
God, Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!
Give me the...
You're over me?
Oh, God.
- Wha...?
You're, uh...
- Oh, God.
- You're over me?
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh...
When...?
When were you under me?
[GROANING]
ROSS:
Rach.
Rachel, do you?
I mean, were you, uh...?
RACHEL:
Ugh.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
- What?
Well, basically ahem, lately, I've, uh...
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, so?
You had feelings for me first.
Whoa, huh.
You know about my...?
You know I had...?
You know?
- Chandler told me.
- When did he...?
When did he...?
When did he?
- When you were in China.
- China.
- Meeting Julie.
- Julie.
Julie.
That's...
Oh, God.
Julie?
Julie, right.
Okay, I need to lie down.
- No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand...
- Okay.
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Okay, so you, uh?
And now, what?
Now...?
Now.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
[INTERCOM BUZZING]
That's...
That's Julie.
That's Julie.
Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
JULIE:
Honey, I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I, uh...
I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've, uh...
Heh.
You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Okay.
Okay.
Cat!
[SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Ugh, thank you.
Heh.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
- All right, Pheebs!
Way to go!
- Yay, me.
Ha, ha.
So how did it happen?
I took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He said he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all, you know:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?" and:
[BABBLING]
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please." You know?
I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking, heh I convinced him.
Heh!
[CHUCKLES]
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
Uh-huh.
This man is my god.
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's, um, interesting.
No.
No, it's not interesting.
Okay?
It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually a hundred percent the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
I was doing great before I found out about you!
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before I met her.
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything to me?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not...
Not...
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés, or...
Or...
Or...
Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away feelings or whatever it was you felt for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I've gotten good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that, Ross.
I don't need your stupid ship!
- Good.
- Good!
And you know what?
Now I got closure!
[YELLS]
[SIGHS]
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out.
It's over.
No way!
With one pound to go?
Come on!
[SINGS] We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh?
Ha, ha.
What?
Heh.
Nothing.
Except tell you, uh, it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know.
Heh.
You know, I mean you can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
Uh-huh.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
- Well, no.
But I...
- I mean if it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you?
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
Okay.
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.
[English

I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
D
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.
I go through the same thing.
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
I've put on weight?
Did you want to...?
No, not weight.
More like insulation.
I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
Please?
Come on, let her do it!
All right.
If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Come here.
Come here!
Can't make hands meet!
The One Where Ross Finds Out
English Subtitles by GELULA CO., INC.
Let's do it!
What?
Nothing.
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.
And we're changing.
Come on, give me five more!
Five more!
Five more and I'll flash you.
One two two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
She's insane!
The woman is insane.
It's before work, after work, and during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?
It was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.
Nice.
He still won't put out?
Nope.
Zilch.
Nothing.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No.
What do you mean?
He's not British.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't think that's the problem.
We went dancing the other night and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes...
I just definitely felt something.
But how much can you tell from a look?
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal.
Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh, Rachel!
Don't look.
What?
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.
You have a date?
Monica's setting me up.
What about Ross and...
What?
My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, you know, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.
You're okay about all this?
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
If you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right.
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Both of you?
Together?
It'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time.
Well, isn't that just lovely?
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Look at that.
I gotta go!
I got a date!
With a man.
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you, but this my first date since my divorce.
If I seem a little nervous I am.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Cats.
How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Maybe 15, 16 years.
Well, that's just great.
Cheers!
Right.
Clink.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's just...
It's this thing.
It's not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound...
He just started going out with her.
Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
Michael, let's talk about you.
So...
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
- So I figured it out.
- What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, you know what I said?
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really?
That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.
If you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
You're right.
You're right.
You are so "yum"!
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?
Fruit flies?
Thank you.
Would you like dessert?
No dessert.
Just the check.
Please.
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
But only because I've been playing the movie "Diner" in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie.
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
Closure!
That's what it is!
That's what I need!
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Hel...
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
- I'm talking.
- I see that.
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.
You're being a little weird about your phone.
All right.
Fine.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
Machine.
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.
Ross!
Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you and your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
You see there, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure".
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Stop.
No, come on!
We can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board!

Ross, no!

Give me the phone!
Give me the...
You're over me?
Oh, God!
- You're...
- Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my...
You know I had...
You know?

When did he?
When did he?

Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
Who's Michael?
Oh, my God!
Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the...
You're over me?
Oh, God!
- You're...
- Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my...
You know I had...
You know?
Chandler told me.
When did he?
When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's...
Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've...
You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat!
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Thank you.
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
All right!
Way to go!
Yea, me!
So how did it happen?
I took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" and "Where is this going?"
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please."
Sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
This man is my god!
I didn't get a cat.
That's interesting.
No, it's not "interesting".
It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
I was doing great before I knew about you!
You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before!
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés or Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.
I don't need your ship!
- Good.
- Good!
And you know what?
Now I got closure!
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out.
It's over.
No way!
With one pound to go?
Come on!
We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
What you gonna do, fat boy?
What?
Nothing.
Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well, no.
But I...
If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you...
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
For a little while.
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.
I go through the same thing.
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
I've put on weight?
Did you want to...?
No, not weight.
More like insulation.
I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
Please?
Come on, let her do it!
All right.
If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Come here.
Come here!
Can't make hands meet!
The One Where Ross Finds Out
Let's do it!
What?
Nothing.
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.
And we're changing.
Come on, give me five more!
Five more!
Five more and I'll flash you.
One two two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
She's insane!
The woman is insane.
It's before work, after work, and during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?
It was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.
Nice.
He still won't put out?
Nope.
Zilch.
Nothing.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No.
What do you mean?
He's not British.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't think that's the problem.
We went dancing the other night and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes....
I just definitely felt something.
But how much can you tell from a look?
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal.
Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh, Rachel!
Don't look.
What?
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.
You have a date?
Monica's setting me up.
What about Ross and....
What?
My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, you know, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.
You're okay about all this?
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
If you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right.
-You're getting a cat?
-Actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Both of you?
Together?
It'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time.
Well, isn't that just lovely?
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Look at that.
I gotta go!
I got a date!
With a man.
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you, but this my first date since my divorce.
If I seem a little nervous I am.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Cats.
How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.
Well, that's just great.
Cheers!
Right.
Clink.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's just....
It's this thing.
It's not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound....
He just started going out with her.
Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
Michael, let's talk about you.
So....
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
-So I figured it out.
-What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, you know what I said?
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really?
That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.
If you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
You're right.
You're right.
You are so "yum"!
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?
Fruit flies?
Thank you.
Would you like dessert?
No dessert.
Just the check.
Please.
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
But only because I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie.
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure
Closure!
That's what it is!
That's what I need!
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just....
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Hel
-Hang on.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-Hi.
I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
-I'm talking.
-I see that.
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.
You're being a little weird about your phone.
All right.
Fine.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
Machine.
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.
Ross!
Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you and your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
You see there, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Stop.
No, come on!
We can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board!
And how was the date?
I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I....
I feel like I dreamed about you last night but I don't remember.
There they are.
Did we speak on the phone?

You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my...
You know I had...
You know?
Chandler told me.
When did he?
When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's...
Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've...
You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat!
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Thank you.
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
All right!
Way to go!
Yea, me!

He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
This man is my god!
I didn't get a cat.
That's interesting.
No, it's not "interesting".
It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
I was doing great before I knew about you!
You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before!
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés or Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.
I don't need your ship!
- Good.
- Good!
And you know what?
Now I got closure!
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out.
It's over.
No way!
With one pound to go?
Come on!
We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
What you gonna do, fat boy?
What?
Nothing.
Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well, no.
But I...
If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you...
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
For a little while.
Okay, what is it about me?
Do I not look fun?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.
Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.
I do the same thing.
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
I've put on weight?
Did you want to...?
No, not weight.
More like insulation.
I'm unemployed, in need of a project.
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
That might get in the way of my lying-around time.
-Please?
-Come on, let her do it!
All right.
But if my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
I never should have said anything.
Come here.
Can't make hands meet!
The One Where Ross Finds Out
Let's do it!
What?
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.
It's cute.
And we're changing.
Come on, give me five more!
Five more!
Five more and I'll flash you.
One two two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
She's insane.
The woman's insane.
Before work, after work, during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
Now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Tell her to stop.
No, while she's unemployed I'm all she's got.
Why don't we all pitch in and buy her a restaurant?
How'd it go with Scott?
It was nice.
Went to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.
Nice.
-He still won't put out?
-Nope.
Zilch.
Nothing.
Sorry, Pheebs.
I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.
He's interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he drives on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No.
What do you mean?
He's not British.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't think that's it.
We went dancing the other night and the way he held me and looked into my eyes I definitely felt something.
How much can you tell from a look?
No, I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal.
Lift my hand and smack her with it.
-Oh, Rachel!
Don't look.
-What?
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.
-You have a date?
-Monica's setting me up.
What about Ross and....
My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.
You're okay about this?
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window all he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.
Monica, I'll come by and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys.
Only if you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right.
-You're getting a cat?
-Actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Both of you?
Together?
It'll live with each of us half the time.
Well, isn't that just lovely?
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Look at that.
I gotta go!
I got a date!
With a man.
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Monica might've mentioned that this is my first date since my divorce.
If I seem a little nervous, I am.
How long do cats live?
-I'm sorry?
-Cats.
How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus, or something.
-Maybe 15, 16 years.
-Well, that's just great.
Cheers!
Right.
Clink.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's this thing.
It's not as bad as it sounds but my friend is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound....
He just started going out with her.
Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
-Michael, let's talk about you.
-All right.
Okay.
So....
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
-So I figured it out.
-What?
Why Scott won't sleep with me.
I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, know what I said?
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really?
That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.
If you wanna know what the deal is, you have to ask him.
You're right.
You're right.
You are so yum!
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.
Why can't they get a bug?
Those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?
-Fruit flies?
-Yes!
Thank you.
-Would you like dessert?
-No!
No dessert.
Just the check.
Please.
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
But only because I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross, and his cat and his Julie.
Look, do you want a piece of pie?
No!
Too late for that, man.
I've screwed this all up.
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?
I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you'll be fine.
You just haven't had any closure.
Closure!
That's it!
That's what I need!
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way, really.
Whatever it takes so that you can say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Hel--
-Hang on.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-Hi.
I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for one minute.
I'm talking.
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.
You're being a little weird about your phone.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
I'm so good with people.
Machine.
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.
Ross!
Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine, and I'm really happy for you.
And your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
See, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
No, no, no no, no, no!
It's Sunday.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Stop.
Come on, we can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are onboard!
Hey, Rach.
And how was the date?
I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Well, actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I....
I think I had a dream about you but I don't remember.
Okay.
There they are.
Did you call me last night?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
I haven't been home yet.
Can I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
-Who's Michael?
-Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the--
You're over me?
Oh, God!
-You're--
-Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rach.
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
-What?
-Okay, okay.
Basically, lately, I've....
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my-- You know I had--
You know?
-Chandler told me.
-When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's-- Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and standing.
So you-- And now, now....
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
-Hi, Julie.
-I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat!
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Thank you.
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
And we did.
-All right!
Way to go!
-Yay, me!
So how did it happen?
I finally asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He understands how sex can be very emotional for a woman.
He was afraid that I was going to get all:
"Will he call me the next day?
Where is this going?"
He said he wanted to hold off until he was ready to be serious.
-Wow.
-Yeah.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please."
Sex can be just about two people in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, fine.
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
This man is my God!
Oh, this one's cute.
Yeah, and this one, and that one.
They're all cute.
They're kittens.
Just wrap one up.
-You okay?
-Yeah, me?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah?
Ross, honey.
Hey.
I know this is a big step, but I think we'll be okay.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
So do you have any cats that are really old or incredibly sick?
I don't want one that's about to die.
We should've worked that out before we came down here.
Okay, sweetie.
I'll narrow it down to this one here and this one with the stripes.
You pick.
Whoa, hey, I have to pick?
Yeah, whichever one you want.
Well, I don't know.
It's not that easy to choose.
Both cats are beautiful and funny.
I'm sure I'd be happy with either cat.
-Well, do you want to take both?
-Both?
Both!
?
I can't have two cats!
Joey's the kind of guys who could have two cats.
Goodnight, Gunther.
-Hi.
-I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's interesting.
No, it's not interesting.
It's very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.
I was doing great before I knew!
I was doing great too!
It's hard to see you with Julie.
You should've said so before!
I didn't know!
How come you never said anything?
There wasn't a good time.
You had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.

Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
Uh, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.

All right.
But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
Look, I never should have said anything.
Come here.

Ooh, can't make hands meet!

So if I seem a little nervous I am.
How long do cats live?

Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Well, that's just great.

Right.

Heh.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's just...
It's this thing.
It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound...
- Huh.
- He just started going out with her.
Ahem.
Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.

Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
Aah!
Closure!
That's what it is.
That's what I need.
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you. "
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.

And that, my friend, is what they call "closure. "
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
Monica, it's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
Ha, hey.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Ha, ha, okay.

Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
- Who's Michael?

God, Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!
Give me the...
You're over me?
Oh, God.
- Wha...?
You're, uh...
- Oh, God.

- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh...
When...?
When were you under me?
Rach.
Rachel, do you?
I mean, were you, uh...?
- Ugh.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
- What?
Well, basically ahem, lately, I've, uh...
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, so?
You had feelings for me first.
Whoa, huh.
You know about my...?
You know I had...?
You know?
- Chandler told me.
- When did he...?
When did he...?
When did he?
- When you were in China.
- China.
- Meeting Julie.
- Julie.
Julie.
That's...
Oh, God.
Julie?
Julie, right.
Okay, I need to lie down.
- No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand...
- Okay.
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Okay, so you, uh?
And now, what?
Now...?
Now.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's...
That's Julie.
That's Julie.
Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
- Honey, I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I, uh...
I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've, uh...
Heh.
You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Okay.
Okay.
Cat!
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Ugh, thank you.
Heh.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
- All right, Pheebs!
Way to go!
- Yay, me.
Ha, ha.
So how did it happen?
I took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He said he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all, you know:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?" and:
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please. " You know?
I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking, heh I convinced him.
Heh!
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
Uh-huh.
This man is my god.
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's, um, interesting.
No.
No, it's not interesting.
Okay?
It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually a hundred percent the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
I was doing great before I found out about you!
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before I met her.
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything to me?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not...
Not...
Not every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés, or...
Or...
Or...
Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away feelings or whatever it was you felt for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I've gotten good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that, Ross.
I don't need your stupid ship!
- Good.
- Good!
And you know what?
Now I got closure!
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out.
It's over.
No way!
With one pound to go?
Come on!
We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh?
Ha, ha.
What?
Heh.
Nothing.
Except tell you, uh, it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know.
Heh.
You know, I mean you can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
Uh-huh.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
- Well, no.
But I...
- I mean if it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you?
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
Okay.
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.

What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.
I go through the same thing.
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
I've put on weight?
Did you want to...?
No, not weight.
More like insulation.
I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.
I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
Please?
Come on, let her do it!
All right.
If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Come here.
Come here!
Can't make hands meet!
The One Where Ross Finds Out
Let's do it!
What?
Nothing.
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.
It's cute!
And we're changing.
Come on, give me five more!
Five more!
Five more and I'll flash you.
One two two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
She's insane!
The woman is insane.
It's before work, after work, and during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Just tell her you want to stop.
I can't.
All she get to work is all she can got.
So that's why I was thinking, maybe we could all pitch in and buy her own restraunt.
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?
It was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.
Nice.
He still won't put out?
Nope.
Zilch.
Nothing.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
I like him a lot.
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No.
What do you mean?
He's not British.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't think that's the problem.
We went dancing the other night and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes...
I just definitely felt something.
But how much can you tell from a look?
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal.
Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh, Rachel!
Don't look.
What?
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.
You have a date?
Monica's setting me up.
What about Ross and...
What?
My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, you know, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.
You're okay about all this?
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
If you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right.
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Both of you?
Together?
Lt'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time.
Well, isn't that just lovely?
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Look at that.
I gotta go!
I got a date!
With a man.
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you, but this my first date since my divorce.
If I seem a little nervous I am.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Cats.
How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Maybe 15, 16 years.
Well, that's just great.
Cheers!
Right.
Clink.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry.
It's just...
It's this thing.
It's not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound...
He just started going out with her.
Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
Michael, let's talk about you.
So...
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
- So I figured it out.
- What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, you know what I said?
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really?
That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.
If you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
You're right.
You're right.
You are so "yum"!
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day.
What are they called?
Fruit flies?
Thank you.
Would you like dessert?
No dessert.
Just the check.
Please.
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
But only because I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie.
Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?
Do like that man, I just screwed this all over.
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure
Closure!
That's what it is!
That's what I need!
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
Hel
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
- I'm talking.
- I see that.
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.
You're being a little weird about your phone.
All right.
Fine.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
So good people!
Machine.
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.
Ross!
Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you and your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
You see there, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
If you say stop, then we stop.
Stop.
No, come on!
We can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board!
And how was the date?
I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I...
I feel like I dreamed about you last night but I don't remember.
There they are.
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
Who's Michael?
Oh, my God!
Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the
You're over me?
Oh, God!
- You're
- Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my You know I had
You know?
Chandler told me.
When did he?
When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat!
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Thank you.
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
- And?
- And we did.
All right!
Way to go!
Yea, me!
So how did it happen?
I took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?
He understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?"
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
So I said, "Okay.
Relax, please."
Sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call.
If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
This man is my god!
This one is cute.
Don't you think.
Yeah.
This one is cute, that one is cute.
They are all cute, they're kittens!
Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.
- Are you OK!
- Yeah, me, sure!
You know this is the big step for us, but I'm got feeling that will be OK.
I know, I know!
Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.
Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.
Oh, see?
We should have worked that out before we came down here.
OK, sweetie.
I'm gonna narrow it down with this one over here and this one with the stripes, OK?
- I have to pick?
- Whickever one you want.
I don't know.
I mean it's not easy to choose.
You know both cat are beautiful, funny.
You will be happy with either cat.
Do you want to take both?
I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.
I didn't get a cat.
That's interesting.
No, it's not "interesting." It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
I was doing great before I knew about you!
You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before!
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?
There was never a good time.

And we only hung out every night!

All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.
I don't need your ship!

And you know what?
Now I got closure!

What you gonna do, fat boy?
What?
Nothing.

You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well, no.
But I...
If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you...
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
You boys have any luck?
I'm afraid a needle in a haystack ring a bell?
Try down there by Buck Creek They might have got that far 10-4

Three escaped
They headed straight into the Oxbow
I don't do that kind of work anymore

I don't know
What do you mean you don't know Goddamit, don't play games
I don't know
I was moving in
Everything was fine.
Then I heard gunshots
When I got to where they should have been
All I found was that shirt
And enough blood on the ground to paint this office
No bodies, nothing
You expect me to believe this cock and bull story?
I don't give a damn what you believe
All I know is I wasted 4 days and I'm out 12 grand
Where you going?

Excuse me
Where the hell is Professor Sloan?
Please don't ask me to go over there
I have already been over there, and over there, and over there
Who wants to know?
Give me a break lady
It took me 3 and a half hours to drive up here to meet this guy
I'm about ready to sick my dog on somebody
You call that a dog?
Will somebody just point out the old fart
L.D. Lillian Diane
You're not the first person to make that mistake Mr...?
Gates, Lewis Gates
Gates...
All right, take this to Sandy and have her clean it up by tonight, ok.
Good work
So Mister Gates, what can this ol fart do for you?
You don't really look like a professor
- So where did you find this
- In the Oxbow
The Oxbow.
Wasn't that just in the news?
Something about convicts.
Yeah, I was the guy they hired to find them
Bounty hunter?
Please, Civil Service.
It's sounds a little less...
Barbaric?
I tracked them for 4 days.
The trail ended in a meadow 20 miles in
Somebody got to those men before I did.
There was blood everywhere, and that
Quite a story
Do you know what this is?
I call it a wild guess...
An arrow?
Cheyenne arrow.
Dog soldier to be exact
Dog soldier?
Within the Cheyenne tribes, there used to be a military society made up of the strongest and bravest men
They were fierce fighters, unyielding
They called themselves, Hotametaneo'o...
Dogmen
The cavalry called them Dog Soldiers, they were suicide soldiers
They often acted as rear guards A sort of sacrificial decoy
So the rest of the tribe could escape
You see?
What does it mean?
Nothing
Except maybe another one of your Civil Servant speech to those men
So what about this?
An authentic reproduction.
About $15 in any tourist shop
I saw something in that meadow
What, exactly?
I do not know.
It was just later I found horse tracks.
And what's unusual about that?
They weren't shod
I checked with the Forest Service and nobodies running stock up in that country
And nobody rides unshod horses except
Indians.
That's what you're implying isn't it?
You don't seriously believe Cheyenne Dog Soldiers are running around loose in the Oxbow?
Do you?
No of course not.
Just...
I'm not a nut case, ok
I'm sorry I can't help you, but
Drop that bone
Get back here
Is that your dog?
Give it back to him Zip
The group from the Institute are here Doctor
I'll be right there
Mr. Gates...
It's been...
entertaining
Drive carefully
Somebody killed those men Doctor
Wasn't me, and it wasn't another bounty hunter
Zip!
Sorry.
Are you always this persistent?
I got half way home before turning back
Call it gut instinct
And what is this gut instinct of yours telling you?
You're not telling me everything
You want something to drink?
Thought you'd never ask!
Well, I'm not hiding anything
You wouldn't eventually uncover
Give me that.
Let go!
So I'm willing to satisfy your curiosity
If you promise not to bother me again
Yep
Mineral water.
It's good for you
Here we are
By late1864, Many tribes were raiding settlements, stealing horses.
Making a general nuisance of themselves
But one of the few Cheyenne chiefs
Really trying to make peace Was Black Kettle
He and his people were instructed to make camp at Sand Creek, near Ft.
Lyon
They'd been promised protection.
So that night they had a feast with dancing and games
To celebrate peace
The following dawn, November 29th was freezing
A group of Colorado volunteers known as the Bloodless Third surrounded the camp
They were instructed to take off their coats
Strange, huh?
Black Kettle immediately raised the American flag and the white flag of peace
People rushing around in great panic and fear and he kept calling out
Not to be frightened, they'd been promised protection, there was no danger
Suddenly, the troops attacked!
Now, two thirds of these Indians were women and children
It was total chaos.
It was a massacre
Blood froze instantly on the bodies
Then looting began
Scalps were taken.
Fingers, ears, noses cut off
Babies were cut out of the wombs.
Women had their uteruses cut off and the soldiers were them on their hats
As a matter of fact, when they put their clean coats back on, they paraded through Denver with body parts decorating their uniforms and horses
Among the few that escaped Sand Creek were 20 men, women and children led by
Lone Wolf, leader of the Dog Men
The soldiers chased them northward, through 2 states
Right up into the mountains of northwestern Montana
The blizzard force them to turn back and they left the Indians for dead
Here, Lone Wolf
There
Now you know every thing there is to know
It's late.
I'm tired.
Good night
Wait a minute.
Don't you see?
It all adds up
What?
Just suppose...
What if by a fluke, or a miracle
What if Lone Wolf and those Cheyenne did survive?
Isn't it possible their descendents could of remained hidden in the Oxbow?
They didn't survive
How do you know?
They were starving in a hostile environment, winter, only the clothes on their back.
They didn't survive.
You sure of that?
If there were Indians in the Oxbow don't you think someone would have seen them by now?
Not necessarily
You are a nut case
Look at the wolf
Now we know wolves exist in the Oxbow, ok?
I've found their tracks.
I've heard their howls.
I've even found the spot where one watched my camp for half a day
- But I've never seen one
- It's not the same
It is the same
It's not the same
Look, Elvis is dead
The government is hiding UFO's and there are no Cheyenne Dog Soldiers living in the Oxbow
Why are you being so goddamed pigheaded?
Because I'm goddamed good at it
I know you saw something out there you can't explain.
I do believe that
But I can't invest all this time and energy into your fantasy, I rely on facts
Now, we're both tired.
I'm going to bed.
You're welcome to the couch
I should warn you, I tend to walk around naked in the morning

How you doing today Mr. Hollis?
When will they put some goddam fish in this river?
I talked to the game warden and he assures me this river is full of fish
Well he's a liar.
Why when I was a kid we'd come down here...
Mr. Hollis, this is Mr. Gates
He's going to visit with you for a while
Full of fish, my ass
Who the hell are you?
Wonder that myself sometimes
Hand me one of them night crawlers, will ya?
So I understand you used to work for the railroad
Not just any railroad son
The Great Northern Pacific.
53 years
Mr. Hollis, tell me about Jacko
Well I'll be damned!
- You remember that?
- Remember
I caught the little runt!
What happened?
Been a hell of a lot of years since I thought of that
35 I think it was
Me and old Ed Vallee, we was heading up to Kootenay
Spur line needed some work
Sometime past noon, We spotted something run across the track
First I thought it was a deer
Then I seen it was a boy
Well Ed stopped the train We lit out after him
There he is!
We chased him a ways and finally cornered him down along the river
Soon as we got close, we seen he was an Indian.
He didn't speak English
- Just sort of grunted
- What did you do with him?
Well, me and Ed didn't know what to do with him
He was cold and tired and so I wrapped him in my shirt
We brung him down to Sheriff Case, He stuck him in a cell cause he didn't have no other place to put him
We nicknamed him Jacko
Cause his face kinda looked wide eyed and scared
Like a jack-o-lantern
Next morning, he was gone
We figured he squeezed out through the bars during the night
Well, that was the end of it.
Nobody ever seen him again
Course the Sheriff contacted some of the local Reservations, but nothing ever come of it
Seems like nobody knew who the boy was ner where he come from
Where do you think he came from?
Hell, I don't know
But you tell me, what's a Indian boy who don't speak a word of English doing way out in the middle of nowhere?
60 miles from the nearest town?
This photo was taken just after these Cheyenne girls arrived
At the Indian School in Carlisle Pennsylvania
The same a girls, 14 months later
Their hair was cut, they were give Christian names and forbidden to speak in their native tongue
So began the Government's policy in dealing with the plains tribe
The policy of...
The policy of assimilation
Religious and cultural
We need to talk
Look at this
17 people disappeared
In the Oxbow since 1898. 17 people, doesn't that seem a little odd?
Do you always where that hat?
There's more
In 1935
A young Indian boy was found on the edge of the Oxbow
Didn't speak a word of English
I talked to the man who caught him
An Indian boy who doesn't speak English and vanishes without a trace
Explain that one
You rely in facts, isn't that what you told me?
Well these are the facts
What do you want from me?
I'm going back in
If my hunch is right I don't want to end up on that list
I need someone along who speaks Cheyenne.
One of your students?
No... oh no
All I'm asking for is a few days.
We ride, we take a look around.
We ride back out.
Three days
If they're out there I have to know and goddamit, so do you
Morning
Folks, I'm in a bit of a rush so, come on... come on!
I got a bad feeling about this
Oh relax, he seems capable enough
I don't trust him
Let's mount up, we got a long ride ahead of us
Good luck Doctor
Excuse me!
What the hell are you doing?
I checking the stirrup
Oh no,no way!
Hey kid get back down here
Don't listen to him John.
I'll see you in three days
You go on now
Like you said, if they're in there, I have to know
This ain't going to be a picnic lady
I've seen this country reduce grown men to tears
Ain't no place for a woman
You really are a cowboy, aren't you?
What is it you fellas say?
"We're burning day light"
POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS
Maybe we should rest
If you're tired
Smells, ah...
Interesting.
What is it?
Lewis Gates wilderness stew
Ah ha, and what's in Lewis Gates wilderness stew
Anything that ain't nailed down
You know when I was a kid
I hated the idea of camping out
I mean, anything that's crawls or bugs scared me to death
So what do I do?
I choose a career that keeps me outdoors 80% of the time
You know, funny how things turn out
Now I find being in the wilderness so invigorating, life affirming, really
Jesus...
Wonder Woman
I've got some aspirin
I don't need any aspirin, thank you
Boy aren't we in a great mood
Hey look, just because I let you ride along doesn't mean I have to like it
Now stop treating me like a child
I didn't realize I was
Thank you
"A.G.?"
Abraham Gates, My grand-father
You really hang on to things
Some things
- Well?
- Not bad
If you don't mind the taste
Alright, I heard that
Now on you cook your own supper.
How's that?
Is he always like this?
Good night Gates
Good night Doc
You're ain't going to walk around naked in the morning are you?
I'll try to restrain myself
Oh, this was ah, where I found the arrow and the tracks
I guided elk hunters in this far but never went beyond that ridge and that's the direction where the tracks were headed
Wonder how long this weather will keep up?
80% chance of rain though tonight.
Clearing by tomorrow
Really?
An old Indian trick?
KQRP all news radio?
Careful of this damn shale
Watch your footing, and I mean it.
If your horse goes down you don't go with him
Thanks for the tip
Don't even move
I told you to watch your step!
You're not in a classroom
Out here one little mistake will get you killed
Feel free to take charge Mr. Gates
Can you see that rope?
Yeah
Well let go and grab it with both hands
What about you?
Don't worry about me Just do it!
- Ready?
- Yeah!
On three!
One...
Two...
Three!
Zip...
Zipp!
Lead the horse!
Good boy!
That's it, good boy!
Now pull her up
Keep her up
You ok?
Yeah!
It's just a little disconcerting to realize the smartest member of our expedition is the dog
Saddle up.
We still got 2 hours of day light yet
Zip, you want a taste?
here let me get ya
Is that good?
You want more?
You are really in your element out here, aren't you?
I like the solitude
Lately it seems like the only time I'm at ease is when I when I got a 100 miles between me and the rest of humanity
Sounds like you were born a century too late
That's what my wife used to say
Used to?
She died a couple years ago
I'm sorry
Was she ill?
We were riding in the back country... making a river crossing
Horse spooked and bucked her.
I went in after her
Current was too strong
One second she was there and...
Her dad still blames me to this day
What more could you have done?
Drown
What about you.
Ever been married?
Only to my work
Don't get me wrong, they've been plenty of men
Some worked out, some didn't
Just always had to be on my terms
Lady, if I was born a century to late,
You were definitely born a century too early
Russell and his wife came across it berry picking
Mrs. Burtney said Lewis was at the Chronicle the other day
He spent three hours going through old copies of the newspaper
What the hell are you up to, Gates?
Oh ah, want a drink?
Love one
Whiskey.
It's good for you
I'm curious about one thing
Why Indians?
Oh, because I admire them and because we owe them a tremendous debt
How's that?
They gave us romance, myths, legends
They gave us a history
The Indians shaped the character of our entire nation
We picked a hell of a way to say thank you didn't we?
Well what happened was inevitable
The way it happened
It was unconscionable
There be any whiskey left?
My head feels like a punching bag thanks to you
I got some aspirin
Oh great, something chewed a hole in my sleeping bag
Tracks?
What?
On the ground.
How many toes?
Four
Ah, it's probably some little chipmunk
Chipmunks, muskrats, squirrels
They all 4 toes in front, 5 in the back, all the others got 5 and 5
Now weasels tho, now they're a different story
They tend to walk on the balls of their feet
The balls of their feet
Look, we've been riding for a week
I agreed to 3 days, I think we should head back
It was romantic idea, Indians in the Oxbow
I admit, I got caught up myself
But...
We have better things to do then go traipsing around these mountains looking for ghosts
If anyone in my department knew what I was doing out here they'd have me committed
I don't know why I let you talk me into this
I have classes to teach
I have a life
As soon as we're packed up we're heading back
Understand?
Gates, have you heard a word I've said?
You want to go back?
Yes!
I'm a anthropologist, not Daniel Boone
Have you seen my canteen?
Where is the canteen?
I hate camping
Gates?
What is the matter with you?
Here's you damn canteen
Speaking Cheyenne
My God!
Very slowly
Toss down your pistol
Do it!
- Don't move!
- Does breathing count?
Look at them
Indian speaking in native tongue
- What are they saying?
- I'm... not sure
Speaking Cheyenne
What are you telling him?
I told him we come in a good way.
In peace
I also told him you were a great warrior
Who wasn't afraid to fight them all single handedly
You got to be kidding
The Cheyenne admire bravery
Let's just hope they don't put you to the test
If they do, I'm coming after you first
- Zip
- Just don't move
No, no,no they'll kill you!
You were right.
They're Cheyenne Dog soldiers
In my life
I never would have believed
And yet here we are
A step back into history
My God, I feel privileged
Sorry, guess I'm not so tough after all
Like hell you're not!
She can't walk any further
She needs a horse
A horse!
She's weak, she has to ride!
Lewis I'll be fine
Listen asshole, either she rides or you're gonna kill both of us right now
You may not understand my words but you get my meaning, don't ya?
What's it gonna be?
Let me take him
Please, you're exhausted, come on
Speaks Cheyenne
Whatever you said I hope it was friendly
Unbelievable!
Yeah, unbelievable
It's no use
The Indian predate the boy scout.
The knots are solid
What are they going to do with us?
I don't know
You the expert, remember?
Well they could kill us
But traditionally many Cheyenne prisoners were just absorbed into the tribe
Absorbed?
Yeah, they treated their prisoners so well they often refused to go home even if they had the chance
Their hospitality overwhelms me
Well you can't blame them really, they're afraid of us
He name is Zip
Lillian how do you say thank you?
Nia'ish
Nia'ish
- He says to follow him
- I'm not leaving my dog
You don't have a choice
What?
This is Spotted Elk
The last surviving son of Lone Wolf
He wants to know if we've come to return him to the house of iron bars
Seems when he was a small boy he was captured by some white men and put in a cage
Jacko
Did you get a line on Mr. personality here?
His name is Yellow Wolf
He's leader of the dog soldiers, next in line to be Chief
I guess it take a real man to shoot a dog
You should be happy they didn't eat him
Oh didn't I tell you, it's the other reason they're called dog soldiers
This is where we stay
They tell of many of Cheyenne killed
From his father's flight from the white soldiers
There was a great storm
The Indians were lost and starving
A wolf appeared and lead them to this valley
The wolf spoke
Telling them to remain here
Hidden from the white man for ever
They survived
This was during the moon when the deer shed their horns
128 winters ago
What's going on over there?
I don't know
They were hunting when his son got separated
They were shot by 3 white men
Yellow Wolf and the dogmen killed them
He's burning up
The infection must be spreading
Lillian, tell me what he needs?
Why don't you try and convince them and I'll ride
He says the decisions not his
It's good you offer, but his people survived all this time without the white man's help
To ask for it now might make something bad happen
Penicillin As much as you can get
Isn't that hard to come by without a prescription?
Use your imagination
Right
Tell him I need my pistol
Now my knife
The knife
Oh, one more thing
- What the hell are you doing?
- That's for Zip
That was stupid
I'm sorry Lillian
But before I do somebody a favor, the score has to be even
That's just the way I am
He'll ride with you part of the way
Be careful
If you don't come back, I'll be killed
It's just the way he is
Easy girl, easy
You did good girl
With you in a minute
I said I'd be...
That's the problem with this country.
Nobody works anymore
Silent Alarm to Canmore Drugs
Don't do it buddy
I've got grandchildren
Relax will ya.
Penicillin, you got that?
Bag it up.
Go on!
Briggs.
Don't try anything.
I already called for backup
Why'd you go and do that?
Now you just stay right where you are
Put that away before you hurt somebody
No more games Lewis
I taking you in
Stop that man, he just robbed me
Rule number one Briggs, never take your eyes off the suspect
Pull over
You pull over
Get out of the way
What the hell are you doing Lewis?
Sheriff, look at this
Convicts elude capture in Oxbow
The Oxbow Quadrangle
You think he's going to make it?
It's too soon to know
Lewis Gates wilderness stew... good!
And it's good for you too.
Here, try that.
Here, you try it then
You don't know what you're missing
It's very nice, but really I couldn't
This is their way of showing thanks.
To refuse their gifts would be insulting
Nia'ish... very beautiful
Lillian, what I'm I going to do with all this stuff?
Well, what all rich eligible bachelors do
Find a wife and settle down
Very funny
Are you shocked?
You known about this?
For a while
Spotted Elk brought me here
He was curious about some of the things
When game is scarce they're forced to hunt outside the valley
That's when they run into white men
They hide from most, but those that venture to close
End up here
Wouldn't you kill to protect your family and way of life?
Oh he wants to know about the silver bird with the long white tail
I just told him man walked on the moon
He just called me a wonderful liar
He wants to know about other Cheyenne.
How they're living
What are you going to tell him?
The truth
You hear that?
I have waited all my life to hear that
You know something Lillian
We can't let anything happen to these people
No one must ever find out
No one
Who?
My father-in-law
I covered my back trail How did they find it?
How much time do we have?
They're 3 mile from the waterfall.
Half a day maybe less
Spotted Elk wants to leave the valley and travel deeper into the mountains
Yellow Wolf says there is no time, they should stay and fight
Jesus, they'll get slaughtered
The Cheyennes or the troopers?
What if we created a diversion?
Maybe it would buy them some more time
From this time on do not mistreat the Cheyenne
Think of us in a good way
All of us are your relations
You exchange gifts at a ceremony
Lillian, they've already got everything I own
From this time on we are one of the like hearted people
You are Cheyenne.
Go in a good way
I was just thinking how much I was going to miss your... wilderness stew
Knock it off Lillian.
Saddle up
I'm afraid this is another journey you're going to have to make on your own
I asked Spotted Elk if I can stay with them
Get on your horse Lillian
No, my works just begun
I want a living record set down
A memorial to the last of their kind
Have you lost your mind?
I spent half my life teaching others
Now out here with these people, I'm the student.
I'm...
living it
I belong with them
I'm staying
Why don't you admit the real reason you're upset
You'll miss me
Let's go Zip
Looks like it's just the two of us
Not you too
I don't believe this
I guess I always knew a woman would come between us
You're better off here anyways
I gotta feeling I'm headed for trouble
Take care of her
He likes to sleep with it
Nia'ish
Nia'ish yourself
This oughta help
That looks ancient.
Is it still good?
Dynamite?
It's like wine
It only get better with age
Easy... easy!
See this
Over time it sweats
Nitro, big boom!
This is goodbye
Will you promise me something
No matter how bad it gets, no matter what happens
Don't let them eat my dog
I promise
You really walk around naked in the morning?
Do weasels really walk around on the balls of their feet?
What would you say to a goodbye kiss?
I'd say it's about time
What the hell was that?
You call that a kiss?
Better
I'm a good student
That too tight?
Sorry about the cheap shot back in town.
Nothing personal
There's a cave half way up
It goes all the way through the waterfall
All right men mount up
You're making a mistake
You do this you're going to get these men killed
All right men, let's move out
Drop it!
I'll kill you where you stand
Drop that damn gun
Do it now!
Put it down Gates
He's hurt bad
What do we do now Deputy?
We're going back.
Come here give me a hand.
I need some help here
They tell me you saved my life
You did for me what you couldn't do for my daughter
I wish to God it was the other way
I'm tired of hating you Lewis
When you're ready I think maybe it's time we had that talk
Nobody around here, including me
Wants to see you put away for stealing some penicillin for Christ's sake
So we're dropping the charges
But there is something I have to know
In that tunnel, just before the explosion
I thought that I saw...
What's out there?
- What do you think is out there?
- OK.
Fine.
Whatever you're protecting?
I hope it's worth is.
THE LAST CHEYENNE
Bredouilles?

Towards the end of 1864, Many tribes
Looting, stealing, went Guilty of all kinds of atrocities
One of the few heads cheyennes
Who really wanted peace Was Black Cauldron
He set up his camp at Sand Creek, Near Fort Lyon
In the evening, there was a feast With dances and games
To celebrate peace
The following day, November 29, Was frigid dawn
A group of volunteers Colorado encercla camp
They were ordered Remove their tunics
Bizarre, no?
Black Cauldron fit hoist the flag American and the white flag
The lndiens paniquèrent But they cried
They had nothing to fear, They had been promised protection
Suddenly, the troops attaquèrent
The 2 / 3 of lndiens Were women and children
The chaos was total.
It was a massacre
The blood of dead bodies frozen immediately
Then looting began
They taillèrent of scalps, Fingers, ears, nose
They arrachèrent foetuses To the matrix
The soldiers accrochèrent To their hats
When they were handed Their own tunic
They défilèrent to Denver with Uniforms decorated with human debris
Twenty men, women And children managed to escape
With Loup Solitaire, Head men-dogs
The military continued Keep to two states
To the mountains of Montana
The blizzard interrupted hunting, On the left for dead lndiens
Hold.
Loup Solitaire
Voilà
You know everything
It is late.
I am tired.
Good night
Wait.
See?
Ça colle
Imagine ...
If by chance, A miracle ...
If Loup Solitaire and Cheyennes Had survived?
-
- If it was their descendants?
-
- They did not survive
How do you know?
Famine, in the winter.
They did not survive
You are more sûre?
If there were lndiens In the Oxbow, we would have seen
Not necessarily
You are crazy
Take the wolf
We now know that there Wolves in the Oxbow, right?
I saw their footsteps, I heard their screams
-
- I never saw -
- It's different
It's the same
It's different
Elvis Presley is dead
The UFOs do not exist, there No Cheyennes in the Oxbow
Why are more if you têtue?
Because I like it
You saw something The inexplicable.
I believe
But I have no time to lose.

Now, I lie down

It's going, Mr. Hollis?
When will they Fish in the river?
The guard tells me that fishing The river is full of fish
It is a liar.
When I was a kid ...
Say hello to Mr. Gates
He came to see you
Full of fish, my ass
You are who you are?
Sometimes I ask myself
Pass me a asticot
You are working on rail
And not any

How did it go?
There are long More than I thought
At 35, I believe it was

A little after noon, We saw something on the road
I thought it was a deer
I saw that it was a boy
Ed arrêté train And he ran after
The voilà!
He was chased
Finally a wedge Close to the river
From nearby, we saw that it was India.
He spoke no English

- It grognait -
- What have you done?

It was cold, I covered With my shirt
He was taken to the sheriff Case, Which put him in cell
Not because he knew where to put
He was nicknamed Hallo

He looked Lanterns for Halloween
On the morning
He disappeared
He had slipped dû Through the bars at night
Nobody has ever reviewed
The Sheriff contacted Reserves corner
But it has not been effective
Nobody knew who was Or where he came from
And after you?
I know nothing
But I ask you
What is a small lndien "In the middle of nowhere
To one hundred terminals From the nearest town?
This photo was taken To the arrival of young Cheyennes
At the Carlisle Indian School, Pennsylvania
The same ones, 14 months later
They had been cut hair, Given names Christians
And forbidden to speak their language
Thus began Official policy
To be against tribes submitted
The policy of ...
I assimilation policy
Religious and cultural
Should we talk
Look at it
17 persons disappeared
In the Oxbow since 1898.
Bizarre, while the same
The cap is screwed?
It is not everything
In 1935
We found a young lndien, Near the Oxbow
He spoke not a word of English
I saw the man who was found
A kid who ignores the English And vanishes into thin air
Explain to me it
You will not believe the facts, Right?
In voilà, facts
What do you want from me?
I returned
If I am right, I want to not finish On the list
I need someone to speak Cheyenne.
One of your students?
Only a few days.
A round trip.
Three days
If they are, I know
And you too, boy
I am a little pressed dépêchons
It does me no good
Calm down.
He seems fairly competent
I am suspicious of him
In saddle.
It was a long way to making
Good luck
Say it!
What are you doing?
I checked the caliper
No question.
Come back!
Do not listen.
It will be seen in three days
Go ahead
You said: if they are, I know
This is not a picnic, My little lady
I saw tears Men hardened here
It is not the place of a woman
You are really A cowboy, huh?
What is it with you?
"Y has no time to lose"?
Defense cross the line
It should perhaps be resting
If you are tired
The smell is ...
Interesting.
What is it?
The ragoût survival Lewis Gates
What Lewis Gates met inside?
What he finds
When I was little
I hated camping
All bêtes me terrifiaient
And I chose a career
That makes me live outdoors Most of the time
It's funny, life
Today, life in the wild Wild, I find it invigorating
I fell on Wonder Woman
I have aspirin
No need for aspirin, please
What mood
I agreed to go, But it does not m'enchante
Not treat me like a kid
I do not pay
"A.G.?"
Abraham Gates, My grand-father
You are very conservative
It depends
-
- So?
-
- Not bad
Outside the goût
It's going, I heard
You make your food
It is always like that?
You will not Walk naked tomorrow morning?
I will try to get empêcher
It was here that I found The cursor and the tracks
I guided hunters here
But never Cross this crête
The tracks are a step in that direction
Does the good weather will hold?
Really?
Old Indian know?
The weather, to the radio
Attention to The filth shale
Make your steps.
If your horse falls
Not with luck
Thanks for the hose
Move especially not
I told you To be careful
This is not college, here
The slightest mistake can kill
I will gladly pass Command
You can see the rope?
Catch it at two hands
And you?
Do what I say!
Prête?
Three!
Emmène the horse!
It's good!
That's right.
Good dog!
Tire-la!
Ski the
You Doing?
I am only A little baffled
That the most intelligent Of the expedition is a dog
In saddle.
We still have 2 hours of day
Want goûter?
Wait, I give thee
C'est bon?
T'en want?
You are really In your element here, right?
I like solitude
These days, it seems That I do feel good
Qu'à 200 terminals The rest of humanity
You are born a century too late
My wife said
The saying?
She died two years ago
Sorry
She was sick?
On passing through a river to horse
His has désarçonnée.
I dived
The current was too strong
In a second, it disappeared ...
His father wants me Still
What would you have done?
Me drown
And you?
You were married?
Only to my work
Make no mistake.
I have known men
With some, it worked
That's me that sets the rules
If me, I have an overdue century
You have one in advance
Russell and his wife have found
Lewis was at the Chronicle The other day
He spent three hours To look back issues
What do you factories, Gates?
You want?
With joy
From whiskey.
It's good for your health
Simple curiosity
Lndiens Why?
Because I admire
We are their debtors
How are you?
They gave us myths, Legends
They gave us a story
They must character Of our nation
They were strangely grateful, ?
What happened was inevitable
The way it happened
Beyond comprehension
If that remains a drop ...
I like a pumpkin head, Thanks to you
I have aspirin
Bravo.
A bête made a hole In my duvet
Traces?
By earth.
How many fingers?
Four
No doubt a small rodent
The chipmunks, muskrats, Squirrels
Have all 4 fingers before, 5 behind.
The others were 5 and 5
The weasels, That's another story
They walk On the soles of the feet
The soles of the feet
There is one week left since
I said 3 days.
Let's turn
It was romantic, Lndiens of the Oxbow
The idea hooked me
But ...
We have to do better That the hunt for ghosts
In college, if we learned, I would interner
Why did I Convinced?
I have to give courses
I have a life
It closed the camp and we go
Understood?
You heard me?
You want to go?
I am an anthropologist, I am not Daniel Boone
You saw my gourd?
Where is my gourd?
I hate camping
What did you take?
The voilà, your gourd
Very slowly
Iâchez your gun
Do it
-
- Over a gesture -
- I can breathe?
Look at them
-
- What do they say?
-
- I am not sûre
What?
I said:
"We came in peace '
And that you are a great warrior
Who would not be afraid To face
It's a joke
The Cheyennes admire the bravery
Let's hope they do not check
Otherwise, I take you first
-
- Hang up -
- Not Move
They will kill you!
You were right.
These are Warriors-dogs cheyennes
In my life
I would not have believed
And yet
We reboard In time
This is an extraordinary opportunity
Pardon.
I am not As hard as I thought
Yeah, right!
It can no longer walk
It needs a horse
A horse!
It is weak!
A horse!
Ça ira
Look, Ducon, You give to him a horse
Or we kill you right away
You are talking not my language, But you understand, right?
Then choose
Give me the
You are exhausted
J'espère it was friendly
Incredible
Useless
The lndien ahead of the boy scout.
The nodes are solid
What will they do with us?
I do not know
You the expert, right?
They could kill us
But often, captives Were absorbed into the tribe
Absorbed?
They treated so well
That the captives often refused To return home
That's their hospitality m'ébahit
You can not blame them, They are afraid of us
He called Zip
How do you say thank you?
-
- We must follow -
- Not without my dog
You have no choice
What?
It Elan Tacheté
Ie last surviving son De Loup Solitaire
He asked whether we want to Back behind iron bars
When he was a child, White had put in a cage
Hallo
What did you learn about this frimeur?
That Yellow Wolf
Ie first-warriors dogs, It will succeed Chief
It's really manly, To shoot a dog
Enjoy They have not eaten
It's also why They are called dog-warriors
We will stay here
They speak Many of Cheyennes killed
From the flight of his father Before the white soldiers
There was a tempête
The lndiens Were lost and hungry
A wolf appeared to them That took them in the valley
The wolf parla
Theirenvironment saying to stay here
Hidden to the white man for ever
They survived
It was during the moon Where the deer lose their wood
There are 128 winters
What will happen là below?
I do not know
They hunted, His son moved away
Three whites have shot
Yellow Wolf and his family killed
It is brûlant
The infection has become widespread
What does it take him?
Try to convince them, j'irai
It is not he who decides
The siens survived All this time without the help of whites
The request today Attract misfortune
Any penicillin You will find
It's hard Without a prescription, right?
A little imagination
That's
I need my gun
And my stabbing
The stabbing
One last thing
-
- What do you do?
-
- For Zip
That idiot
I regret
I do not pay service Unless the accounts are settled
I like that, that's all
It accompanies you
Be careful
If you do not come back, They kill me
It is like that, that's all
While sweet, but sweet
Well done, my beautiful
I am to you
But I told you ...
This is not In our country
Nobody more bump
Signal Alarm To the pharmacy Canmore
Be not like it
I am grand-father
Calm down.

I called in reinforcements
Why?
Stay where you are
Range it

Rule number one: never Suspect leave the eye
Arrête!
Arrête yourself even
Remove
What are you doing?
Look at it
Fugitive in Oxbow
Quadrilatère of Oxbow

It's too early to say
The survival ragoût Lewis Gates, good
And good for your health.
Goûtez
Hold, goûtez
You know not what you miss
It's nice, but I ...
It is their way of saying thanks.
The refusal is an insult
Very nice
What this fourbi?
Like all rich singles.
Find a Wife
Very funny
Hard to swallow?
You knew?
Over time
Elan Tacheté brought me here
Some items the intriguaient
They sometimes hunt Out of the valley
They meet White
They hide, But those who are approaching too ...
Finissent here
You do not protect tueriez Your family and traditions?
He wondered about the bird money To the long tail
I said we walked on the moon
He said that although I Lie
He asked how living Other Cheyennes
What you say?
The truth
You hear?
I waited all my life To hear it
I will tell you
It owes nothing happen to them
Nobody should discover
Person
Who?
My step-father
How have they found?
It leaves us how much?
They are to 5 km from the fall.
A half-day
Elan Tacheté wants to leave the valley
Yellow Wolf him, Wants to stay to fight
They are being massacred
The Cheyennes or others?
If we did diversion?
It would give them more time
Now, no more mistreats The Cheyennes
Think to us well
We are all parents
We must present exchange
They have already taken everything
Now, You are the same heart that we
You are a Cheyenne.
Go in peace
I would think that your ragoût I would miss
Forget it.
In saddle
Another trip That you must do it alone
I asked to Elan Tacheté To remain with them
A horse
My work began to penalty
I would note, Any record
Develop the memorial Recent Cheyennes
You are crazy?
I spent my life to teach
Here, today, with them, C'est moi l'élève
My place is with them
I remain
Recognize therefore What you embête
I will miss
Allons-y
Nothing that we both, apparently
Not you too
I think not
I always knew A woman separates us
T'es better here goes
Là where I go, it's going to PR
Sleep on it
He sleeps with
Toi same -
It should help
If old, it still works?
The dynamite?
It's like wine
It improves with age
Slowly
Watch
In the long run, it seeps
The Nitro, boum
So, goodbye
Make me a promise
Whatever happens, As badly as it turns
Empêchez them Eating my dog
It promised
You walk really naked, In the morning?
The weasels walk really On the soles of the feet?
A farewell kiss?
It is time
You call that a kiss?
It's better
I am good élève
Too tight?
Pardon for another day.
I have nothing against you
Y has a cave at mid-slope
It crosses the waterfall
A horse, guys
T'as wrong
You are going to kill them
Forward
Easy!
I kill you on the spot
Leave your weapon
Immediately
Easy does it
He is wounded
It does what?
Half turn!
I need a helping hand
You have saved his life
T'as done for me what T'as not have done for my daughter
I would have preferred as the opposite
When you want, I think It is time to talk
Nobody here, including me
No one wants to see you in taule For a flight of penicillin
It abandons prosecution
But it is necessary that I know
In this gallery, Before the explosion
I believed see ...
What is out there?
- What you think is out there?
- OK.
Fine.
What ever you are proteing?
I hope it worth is.
( narrator ) I'D SAY MOST OF WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS TRUE.
THE REST...
WELL, THE REST IS "THE WEST".
NOW OF COURSE, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER,
WHEN LEWIS FIRST TOLD ME-- NOT RIGHT OFF,
I'M NO DAMN FOOL, AND LEWIS GATES,
HE KNOWS NOT TO TAKE ME FOR ONE.
LEWIS...
HE'S THE KIND OF FELLA,
TELLS YOU A STORY...
WELL YOU WANT TO KEEP ONE EYE ON HIM,
AND THE OTHER LOOKING OUT FOR ANYONE COMING TO SETTLE WITH HIM.
AND YOU'D BETTER KEEP YOUR HAND ON YOUR DRINK TOO.
'CAUSE LEWIS HAS CARRIED A CONSIDERABLE THIRST AROUND THE LAST FEW YEARS.
NOW I'VE TOLD MY OWN SHERIFF STORIES,
AND I'VE HEARD LOT TOO,
BUT THIS ONE...
LEWIS TOLD ME, I'VE NEVER HEARD THE LIKE.
WHEREVER THEY GET TO,
ALL GOOD STORIES BEGIN AND END IN THE SAME PLACE--
AND THAT'S THE HEART OF A MAN OR A WOMAN.
WE'LL GET THERE IN A LITTLE TIME,
BUT THIS IS A WESTERN STORY.
AT LEAST IT STARTS AND ENDS IN THE WEST.
SO IT BEGINS THE WAY ALL WESTERN STORIES OUGHT TO...
WITH OUTLAWS.
YOU BOYS HAVE ANY LUCK ?
( helicopter ) Does the phrase "needle in a haystack" ring a bell ?
TRY DOWN THERE BY BUCK CREEK.
THEY MIGHTA GOT THAT FAR. 10-4.
I WANT THOSE BASTARDS FOUND !
( sheriff ) YOU GOT THE RIGHT HEAD COUNT ?
SHERIFF,
THEY KILLED ONE OF THE GUARDS.
THEY CUT HIS THROAT.
JESUS !
WHAT DO YOU FIGURE THEY'LL DO?
KEEP RUNNING, MAKE FOR THE BORDER.
BUY A LITTLE CONDO ON A LAKE SOMEWHERE
AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STANDING IN THEIR WAY-- 4,000 SQUARE MILES OF THE ROUGHEST COUNTRY GOD EVER PUT ON A MAP.
THERE'S NOT A ROAD, NOT A TOWN.
THERE'S PLACES OUT THERE THAT HAVEN'T SEEN A FOOTPRINT.
SHERIFF ?
WHO ARE THOSE GUYS ?
FIND GATES.
LEWIS GATES ?
BUT I THOUGHT YOU--
JUST FIND HIM.
YES, SIR !
RISE AND SHINE, LEWIS.
( plop )
UGHHH...
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ?
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STOP ME AFTER 3, REMEMBER ?
LEWIS !
I DON'T THINK LEWIS EVER TOOK THAT DAMN HAT OFF FOR NOTHIN'...
EVER.
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER WHERE WE PARKED, 'CAUSE I SURE DON'T.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT TO HIM,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS,
I NEVER SAW HIM WEAR THAT HAT BEFORE HE GOT MARRIED,
AND AFTER SHE DIED, WELL, I NEVER SAW HIM WITHOUT IT.
HE WORE IT PROUD.
KIND OF THE WAY A WOMAN WOULD WEAR A WEDDING RING.
LEWIS !
I DIDN'T DO IT AND WHOEVER SAID I DID IS A LIAR.
A BUSLOAD OF PRISONERS WENT OFF THE HIGHWAY LAST NIGHT.
THREE ESCAPED.
THEY'RE HEADED STRAIGHT INTO THE OXBOW.
I DON'T DO THAT KIND OF WORK ANYMORE.
LEWIS, WAIT !
THE FBI SHOWED UP.
THEY NEED ONE BROUGHT OUT ALIVE.
DEEGAN HIMSELF SENT ME TO FIND YOU !
( bottles rattling )
TELL DEEGAN HE CAN KISS MY ASS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT YOURSELF.
BRIGGS...
JUST TALK TO HIM, OTHERWISE HE'LL CHEW MY BUTT.
LEWIS, PLEASE !
DEEGAN, I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I TOLD YOUR DEPUTY,
NOT INTERESTED.
NOW YOU LISTEN GOOD,
I NEED YOU ON THIS ONE.
DRUNK OR SOBER, YOU'RE STILL THE BEST TRACKER IN THE STATE.
YOU ALWAYS WERE A CHARMER.
BRIGGS, IS THAT MANGY DOG OF HIS THERE ?
( Briggs ) Could use a bath, sir.
( Deegan ) I just got a complaint that he's been chasing deer again.
I want you to take Mr. Gates down to the lockup.
FIFTEEN DAYS FOR WILDLIFE HARASSMENT...
AND FAILURE TO OBEY THE LEASH LAW.
"LEASH LAW" ?
YOU SHOULDN'T PROVOKE HIM, LEWIS.
HELL, I SHOULDN'T DO A LOT OF THINGS I END UP DOING.
YOU GOING IN AFTER THEM CONVICT FELLAS ?
YEAH, IT APPEARS I AM.
MY COUSIN WALKED INTO THEM MOUNTAINS 20 YEARS AGO.
NEVER COME OUT.
ANY MESSAGE IN CASE I COME ACROSS 'EM ?
YEAH, TELL HIM I RUN OFF WITH HIS WIFE.
COME ON, ZIP !
( dog barking )
WHERE'D THEY GO IN ?
BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE.
THE DOGS LOST THE TRAIL AT THE NORTH FORK.
ARMED ?
MORE THAN LIKELY.
A 12 GAUGE PUMP AND .357
STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.
THAT'LL BE 4,000 CASH PER MAN PLUS EXPENSES.
YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU'RE ALWAYS PAID,
NOT A DIME MORE.
COME ON, ZIP.
I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO JAIL.
SHERIFF ?
GATES !
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE OTHER TWO,
BUT SEARS COMES OUT ALIVE.
IF THERE'S ONE SCRATCH ON HIM
YOU DON'T EVEN GET HORSE FEED.
I'LL TREAT HIM WITH "KID GLOVES".
THERE WAS REAL TROUBLE BETWEEN LEWIS AND THE SHERIFF,
FAMILY STUFF.
THE KIND THAT RUNS DEEPER THAN ANY WOUND.
EVERY TIME THE SHERIFF SAW LEWIS,
HE REMEMBERED THE LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER.
HE LOVED HER, AND HE BLAMED LEWIS FOR THAT LOSS.
BUT NO MORE THAN LEWIS MOURNED THE SAME LOSS
OR BLAMED HIMSELF, HE HATED HIMSELF FOR IT.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?
GO ON.
GET TO WORK.
( barking )
GOOD BOY, ZIP.
( woodpecker pecking )
( thunder crashes )
( panting )
( coughing )
LOOKS LIKE WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO GOT THIRSTY.
( elk calling )
( whispering ) Four legs or two ?
Go on.
Check it out !
( twig snapping )
DAMN IT, ZIP !
I ALMOST LET THE AIR OUT OF YOU !
MAKE SOME NOISE NEXT TIME, WILL YOU !
HEY, IT'S MY HAT, YOU KNOW ?
HOWDY, BOYS.
( whining )
AW, RELAX.
THEY AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.
WE'LL GO UP GRAB THEM AT "FIRST LIGHT".
BESIDES, I'M BEAT.
TOMORROW WE CASH IN, ZIPPY.
MAYBE WE'LL FINALLY GET THAT LOG CABIN BUILT.
YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE A REAL ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD ?
OF COURSE THIS AIN'T SUCH A BAD ROOF EITHER.
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT, LEWIS TOLD ME WAS LIKE A DREAM.
COMING AT YOU ALL AT ONCE,
EVERYTHING HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME.
AND DAMNED IF HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A DREAM,
AT FIRST ANYWAY...
HUH !
SHHHHH...
WHAT IS IT ?
SOMEBODY'S OUT THERE.
AND THE KID.
LEAVE HIM.
HE WON'T BE BACK.
HELL NO,
NOT WITH A GUT FULL OF BUCKSHOT.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ?
HEY !
I'M GETTIN' OUT OF HERE.
ARHH !
GODDAMN IT !
C'MON !
SHIT !
WHO ARE YOU ?
( thwack )
WHO ARE YOU ?
( thwack ) UGHH !
( Zip yipping )
( whinnying )
HOLDING THAT ARROW IN HIS HAND, HE KNEW HE WASN'T DREAMING.
IT WAS MORE LIKE HE HAD FINALLY WOKE UP
AND THERE WAS FINALLY SOMETHING STRAIGHT AND SIMPLE
POINTING THE WAY.
( Zip barking )
( Sheriff ) I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER ABOUT YOU.
SEARS GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE ?
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
WE SHOULD'VE.
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
MY DAUGHTER'S DEAD.
NOW...
WHERE'S MY MAN ?
YOU WANT THE REST OF 'EM ?
YOU RIDE IN AND FIND THEM YOURSELF.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ?
IT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT OF YOUR RUNNERS.
WHAT ?
THEY'RE DEAD.
ALL OF THEM ?
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "YOU DON'T KNOW" ?
GODDAMN IT, DON'T PLAY GAMES !
I DON'T KNOW !
I WAS MOVING IN, EVERYTHING WAS FINE,
THEN I HEARD GUNSHOTS.
WHEN I GOT TO WHERE THEY SHOULDA BEEN,
ALL I FOUND WAS THAT SHIRT,
AND ENOUGH BLOOD ON THE GROUND TO PAINT THIS OFFICE.
NO BODIES, NOTHING.
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THIS COCK AND BULL STORY ?
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
ALL I KNOW IS I'VE WASTED 4 DAYS, AND I'M OUT 12 GRAND.
WHERE YOU GOING ?
SHERIFF, GATES IS--
JUST LEAVING.
( sheriff ) I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU.
I WANT SOME ANSWERS !
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.
( hooves galloping )
I'M LOOKING FOR PROFESSOR SLOAN.
OVER THERE.
WHERE'S PROFESSOR SLOAN ?
UH, OVER THAT WAY.
EXCUSE ME, I'M LOOKING FOR PROFESSOR SLOAN.
EXCUSE ME.
WHERE THE HELL IS PROFESSOR SLOAN,
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK ME TO GO OVER THERE.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE, AND OVER THERE...
WHO WANTS TO KNOW ?
GIVE ME A BREAK, LADY.
IT TOOK ME 3½ HOURS TO DRIVE UP HERE TO MEET THIS GUY.
I'M ABOUT READY TO SIC MY DOG ON SOMEBODY.
YOU CALL THAT A DOG ?
COULD SOMEBODY JUST POINT OUT THE OLD FART ?
L.D. -
- LILLIAN DIANE
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE MR.... ?
GATES, LEWIS GATES.
GATES...
ALL RIGHT, TAKE THIS TO SANDY AND HAVE HER CLEAN IT UP BY TONIGHT.
GOOD WORK.
SO MR. GATES, WHAT CAN THIS OLD FART DO FOR YOU ?
YOU DON'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A PROFESSOR...
SO WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS ?
IN THE OXBOW.
THE OXBOW ?
WASN'T THAT JUST IN THE NEWS ?
SOMETHING ABOUT CONVICTS ?
YEAH, I'M THE GUY THEY HIRED TO FIND 'EM.
A BOUNTY HUNTER ?
PLEASE, UH, CIVIL SERVANT, IT SOUNDS A LITTLE LESS...
BARBARIC ?
I TRACKED THEM FOR FOUR DAYS,
AND THE TRAIL ENDED IN A MEADOW 20 MILES IN.
SOMEBODY GOT TO THOSE MEN BEFORE I DID.
THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE AND THAT.
THAT'S QUITE A STORY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ?
CALL IT A WILD GUESS, UH...
AN ARROW ?
CHEYENNE ARROW,
"DOG SOLDIER" TO BE EXACT.
"DOG SOLDIER" ?
WITHIN THE CHEYENNE TRIBE,
THERE USED TO BE A MILITARY SOCIETY
MADE UP OF THE STRONGEST AND BRAVEST MEN.
THEY WERE FIERCE FIGHTERS, UNYIELDING.
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES CHOTOMETNEA, "DOGMEN".
THE CAVALRY CALLED THEM "DOG SOLDIERS"
OR "SUICIDE SOLDIERS".
THEY OFTEN ACTED AS REAR GUARD, SORT OF...
SACRIFICIAL DECOYS,
SO THE REST OF THE TRIBE COULD ESCAPE.
YOU SEE ?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?
NOTHING,
EXCEPT MAYBE ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR "CIVIL SERVANTS"
BEAT YOU TO THOSE MEN.
SO WHAT ABOUT THIS ?
AN AUTHENTIC REPRODUCTION.
ABOUT $15.00 IN ANY TOURIST SHOP.
I SAW SOMETHING IN THAT MEADOW.
WHAT...
EXACTLY ?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT LATER I FOUND HORSE TRACKS.
AND WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT ?
THEY WEREN'T SHOD.
I CHECKED WITH THE FOREST SERVICE
AND NOBODY'S RUNNING STOCK UP IN THAT COUNTRY.
AND NOBODY RIDES UNSHOD HORSES EXCEPT--
INDIANS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING, ISN'T IT ?
WELL...
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY BELIEVE CHEYENNE DOG SOLDIERS
ARE RUNNING AROUND LOOSE IN THE OXBOW, DO YOU ?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I'M JUST...
I'M NOT A NUTCASE, O.K. ?
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU, BUT...
( man ) COME BACK HERE !
DROP THAT BONE !
DROP IT !
GET BACK HERE.
IS THAT YOUR DOG ?
GIVE IT BACK TO HIM, ZIP.
THE GROUP AND THE INSTITUTE'S HERE, DOCTOR.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
Mr. GATES, IT'S BEEN...
ENTERTAINING.
DRIVE CAREFULLY.
SOMEBODY KILLED THOSE MEN, DOCTOR.
IT WASN'T ME AND IT WASN'T ANOTHER BOUNTY HUNTER.
( knock on door )
( knocking )
ZIP !
SORRY.
ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS PERSISTENT ?
I GOT HALFWAY HOME BEFORE TURNING BACK.
CALL IT GUT INSTINCT.
AND WHAT'S THIS GUT INSTINCT TELLING YOU ?
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME EVERYTHING.
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK ?
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK !
WELL, I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING
YOU WOULDN'T EVENTUALLY UNCOVER.
Gimme that !
Let go !
Let go !
ZIP !
( snaps )
SO I'M WILLING TO SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY
IF YOU...
PROMISE NOT TO BOTHER ME AGAIN.
DEAL.
MINERAL WATER.
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU !
HERE WE ARE.
BY LATE 1864,
MANY TRIBES WERE RAIDING SETTLEMENTS, STEALING HORSES,
MAKING A GENERAL NUISANCE OF THEMSELVES.
BUT ONE OF THE FEW CHEYENNE CHIEFS
REALLY TRYING TO MAKE PEACE WAS BLACK KETTLE.
HE AND HIS PEOPLE WERE INSTRUCTED TO MAKE CAMP AT SAND CREEK.
THEY'D BEEN PROMISED PROTECTION SO THAT NIGHT THEY HAD A FEAST
WITH DANCING AND GAMES TO CELEBRATE PEACE.
THE FOLLOWING DAWN, NOVEMBER 29TH, WAS FREEZING.
A GROUP OF COLORADO VOLUNTEERS KNOWN AS "THE BLOODLESS THIRD"
SURROUNDED THE CAMP.
THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO TAKE OFF THEIR COATS.
STRANGE, HUH ?
BLACK KETTLE IMMEDIATELY RAISED AN AMERICAN FLAG
AND THE WHITE FLAG OF PEACE.
PEOPLE WERE RUSHING AROUND IN GREAT PANIC,
AND HE KEPT CALLING OUT NOT TO BE FRIGHTENED,
THERE WAS NO DANGER...
SUDDENLY THE TROOPS ATTACKED.
TWO-THIRDS OF THESE INDIANS WERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS.
IT WAS A MASSACRE.
BLOOD FROZE INSTANTLY ON THE BODIES.
THEN THE LOOTING BEGAN, SCALPS WERE TAKEN,
FINGERS, EARS, NOSES CUT OFF,
BABIES WERE CUT OUT OF THE WOMBS.
WOMEN HAD THEIR UTERUSES CUT OFF,
AND THE SOLDIERS WORE THEM ON THEIR HATS.
WHEN THEY PUT THEIR CLEAN COATS BACK ON,
THEY PARADED THROUGH DENVER WITH BODY PARTS
DECORATING THEIR UNIFORMS AND HORSES.
JESUS !
AMONG THE FEW THAT ESCAPED WERE 20 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN
LED BY "LONE WOLF", LEADER OF THE DOGMEN.
THE SOLDIERS CHASED THEM NORTHWARD THROUGH TWO STATES,
RIGHT UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHWESTERN MONTANA.
A BLIZZARD FORCED THEM TO TURN BACK AND THEY
LEFT THE INDIANS FOR DEAD.
HERE...
LONE WOLF.
THERE...
NOW YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW.
IT'S LATE.
I'M TIRED.
GOOD NIGHT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T YOU SEE ?
IT ALL ADDS UP.
WHAT ?
JUST SUPPOSE.
WHAT IF BY A FLUKE OR A MIRACLE--
WHAT IF "LONE WOLF" AND THOSE CHEYENNE DID SURVIVE ?
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THEIR DESCENDANTS COULD REMAIN HIDDEN IN THE OXBOW ?
THEY DIDN'T.
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?
THEY WERE STARVING IN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT,
ONLY THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACKS-
- THEY DIDN'T SURVIVE.
YOU'RE SURE OF THAT ?
IF THERE WERE INDIANS IN THE OXBOW,
DON'T YOU THINK SOMEONE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM BY NOW ?
NOT NECESSARILY !
YOU ARE A NUTCASE !
LOOK AT THE WOLF.
WE KNOW WOLVES EXIST IN THE OXBOW, OKAY ?
I'VE FOUND THEIR TRACKS.
I'VE HEARD THEIR HOWLS.
I EVEN FOUND WHERE ONE WATCHED MY CAMP FOR HALF A DAY.
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE !
THAT'S NOT THE SAME.
IT IS THE SAME !
IT'S NOT THE SAME !
LOOK.
ELVIS IS DEAD, THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T HIDING UFO's,
AND THERE ARE NO CHEYENNE DOG SOLDIERS LIVING IN THE OXBOW.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO GODDAMN PIGHEADED ?
'CAUSE I'M GODDAMN GOOD AT IT !
LOOK...
I KNOW YOU SAW SOMETHING OUT THERE YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN.
I DO BELIEVE THAT.
BUT I CAN'T INVEST ALL THIS TIME AND ENERGY IN PURE FANTASY.
I RELY ON FACTS.
NOW, WE'RE BOTH TIRED.
I'M GOING TO BED.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO THE COUCH.
BUT, I SHOULD WARN YOU, I...
TEND TO WALK AROUND NAKED IN THE MORNING.
( door slams )
( car leaving )
( woman ) THESE FILES CONTAIN COPIES OF EVERY ISSUE WE EVER PUBLISHED.
NINETY-THREE YEARS WORTH.
THERE YOU ARE, SON.
HAPPY HUNTIN'.
THANK YOU.
"...
HALF-STARVED..."
"...
NICKNAMED JACKO..."
"DOESN'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH" ?
( nurse ) GOOD MORNING.
HI !
HOW YOU DOING TODAY, MR. HOLLIS ?
WHEN THEY GONNA PUT SOME GODDAMN FISH IN THIS RIVER ?
I TALKED TO THE GAME WARDEN, AND HE ASSURES ME
THAT THIS RIVER IS FULL OF FISH.
WELL, HE'S A LIAR.
WHEN I WAS A KID--
MR. HOLLIS, THIS IS MR. GATES.
HE'S GONNA VISIT WITH YOU FOR A WHILE.
"FULL OF FISH", MY ASS !
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU ?
I WONDER THAT MYSELF SOMETIMES.
HAND ME ONE OF THEM NIGHTCRAWLERS, WILL YOU ?
YES, SIR.
I UNDERSTAND YOU USED TO WORK FOR THE RAILROAD.
NOT JUST ANY RAILROAD, SON.
THE GREAT NORTHERN PACIFIC.
FIFTY-THREE YEARS !
MR. HOLLIS...
TELL ME ABOUT "JACKO".
"JACKO" ?
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
YOU REMEMBER, THEN ?
REMEMBER ?
I CAUGHT THE LITTLE RUNT !
WHAT HAPPENED ?
BEEN A HELLUVA LOT OF YEARS SINCE I THOUGHT OF THAT.
'35, I THINK IT WAS.
ME AND OLD ED,
WE WAS HEADED UP TO COOPNEY.
THE SPUR LINE NEEDED SOME WORK.
SOMETIME PAST NOON,
WE SPOTTED SOMETHING RUNNING ACROSS THE TRACKS.
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A DEER.
THEN I SEEN IT WAS A BOY !
( brakes screeching )
ED STOPPED THE TRAIN.
WE LIT OUT AFTER HIM.
WAIT!
THERE HE IS !
WE CHASED HIM A WAYS
AND FINALLY CORNERED HIM DOWN ALONG THE RIVER.
SOON AS WE GOT CLOSE, WE SEEN HE WAS AN INDIAN !
DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH, JUST SORT OF GRUNTED.
( Lewis ) WHAT DID YOU DO WITH HIM ?
ME AND ED DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM !
HE WAS COLD AND TIRED, SO I WRAPPED HIM IN MY SHIRT.
WE BRUNG HIM DOWN TO SHERIFF CASE.
HE STUCK HIM IN A CELL,
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO PUT HIM.
WE NICKNAMED HIM "JACKO"
'CAUSE HIS FACE KINDA LOOKED WIDE-EYED AND SCARED,
LIKE A JACK-O-LANTERN.
THE NEXT MORNING, HE WAS GONE.
WE FIGURED HE SQUEEZED OUT THROUGH THE BARS DURING THE NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE END OF IT.
NOBODY EVER SEEN HIM AGAIN.
OF COURSE, THE SHERIFF CONTACTED SOME OF THE LOCAL RESERVATIONS,
BUT NOTHING EVER COME OF IT.
SEEMED LIKE NOBODY KNEW WHO THE BOY WAS
NOR WHERE HE COME FROM.
WHERE DO YOU THINK HE CAME FROM ?
HELL...
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT YOU TELL ME...
WHAT'S AN INDIAN BOY WHO DON'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH
DOING WAY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,
SIXTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN ?
THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN JUST AFTER THESE CHEYENNE GIRLS ARRIVED
AT THE INDIAN SCHOOL IN CARLISLE, PENNSYLVANIA.
THE SAME GIRLS, FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER.
THEIR HAIR WAS CUT.
THEY WERE GIVEN CHRISTIAN NAMES
AND FORBIDDEN TO SPEAK IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUE.
SO BEGAN THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY
IN DEALING WITH THE CONQUERED PLAINS TRIBES.
THE POLICY OF ASSIMILATION--
BOTH RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL...
WE NEED TO TALK.
LOOK AT THIS.
SEVENTEEN PEOPLE DISAPPEARED
IN THE OXBOW SINCE 1898.
DOESN'T THAT SEEM A LITTLE ODD ?
DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR THAT HAT ?
THERE'S MORE.
1935, A YOUNG INDIAN BOY WAS FOUND ON THE EDGE OF THE OXBOW.
DIDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH.
I TALKED TO THE MAN WHO CAUGHT HIM.
AN INDIAN BOY WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH
AND VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE--
EXPLAIN THAT ONE.
YOU RELY ON FACTS, ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME ?
WELL, THESE ARE THE FACTS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ?
I'M GOING BACK IN.
IF MY HUNCH IS RIGHT, I DON'T WANNA END UP ON THAT LIST.
I NEED SOMEONE ALONG WHO SPEAKS CHEYENNE.
ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS ?
NO.
OH, NO.
ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS A FEW DAYS.
WE RIDE IN,
WE TAKE A LOOK AROUND, WE RIDE BACK OUT-
- THREE DAYS !
IF THEY'RE OUT THERE, I HAVE TO KNOW.
AND GODDAMN IT, SO DO YOU.
MORNING.
FOLKS, I'M IN A BIT OF A RUSH, SO--
COME ON.
( man ) I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.
( Sloan ) OH, RELAX.
HE SEEMS CAPABLE ENOUGH.
( man ) I DON'T TRUST HIM.
LET'S MOUNT UP.
WE GOT A LONG RIDE AHEAD OF US.
( man ) GOOD LUCK, DOCTOR.
EXCUSE ME ?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ?
I'M CHECKING THE STIRRUP.
OH, NO.
NO WAY !
HEY, KID, GET BACK DOWN HERE !
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, JOHN.
I'LL SEE YOU IN 3 DAYS.
YOU GO ON NOW.
LIKE YOU SAID, IF THEY'RE IN THERE, I HAVE TO KNOW.
THIS AIN'T GOING TO BE A PICNIC, LADY.
I'VE SEEN THIS COUNTRY REDUCE GROWN MEN TO TEARS.
AIN'T NO PLACE FOR A WOMAN !
YOU REALLY ARE A COWBOY, AREN'T YOU ?
WHAT IS IT YOU FELLAS SAY ?
"WE'RE BURNIN' DAYLIGHT."
TALKING ABOUT HER--
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HER A LOT--
HE ALWAYS CALLED HER LILLIAN.
KINDA FORMAL, LIKE HE WANTED TO KEEP HIS DISTANCE.
OH, HE KNEW HER.
BY INSTINCT, HE KNEW HER.
AND SHE KNEW HIM THE SAME WAY.
WANDERERS, BOTH OF 'EM, OR SEARCHERS,
NOW THEY HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO LOOK FOR.
AND THERE WAS A CHANCE THEY'D, EACH OF THEM,
FIND WHAT THEY'D ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR.
MAYBE WE SHOULD REST.
IF YOU'RE TIRED.
IT SMELLS INTERESTING.
WHAT IS IT ?
"LEWIS GATES" WILDERNESS STEW.
UH-HUH, AND WHAT'S IN "LEWIS GATES" WILDERNESS STEW ?
ANYTHING THAT AIN'T NAILED DOWN.
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A KID,
I HATED THE IDEA OF CAMPING OUT.
I MEAN ANYTHING THAT CRAWLED OR BUZZED,
SCARED ME TO DEATH.
SO WHAT DO I DO ?
I CHOOSE A CAREER THAT KEEPS ME OUTDOORS 80% OF THE TIME.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY HOW THINGS TURN OUT.
NOW I FIND BEING IN THE WILDERNESS SO...
INVIGORATING, LIFE-AFFIRMING.
JESUS, WONDER WOMAN.
I'VE GOT SOME ASPIRIN.
I DON'T NEED ANY ASPIRIN, THANK YOU.
AREN'T WE IN GREAT MOOD.
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE I LET YOU RIDE ALONG
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO LIKE IT !
NOW STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD.
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS.
THANK YOU.
A.G.?
ABRAHAM GATES, MY GRANDFATHER.
YOU REALLY HANG ON TO THINGS.
SOME THINGS.
WELL ?
NOT BAD.
IF YOU DON'T MIND THE TASTE.
ALRIGHT, I HEARD THAT !
FROM NOW ON YOU COOK YOUR OWN SUPPER, HOW'S THAT ?
IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THIS ?
GOOD NIGHT, GATES.
GOOD NIGHT, DOC.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK AROUND NAKED IN THE MORNING, ARE YOU ?
I'LL TRY TO RESTRAIN MYSELF.
THIS IS WHERE I FOUND THE ARROW AND THE TRACKS.
I GUIDED ELK HUNTERS IN THIS FAR,
BUT NEVER WENT BEYOND THAT RIDGE
AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION THE TRACKS ARE HEADED.
I WONDER HOW LONG THIS WEATHER'LL KEEP UP. 80% CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH TONIGHT,
CLEARING BY TOMORROW.
REALLY ?
AN OLD INDIAN TRICK ?
KQRP ALL NEWS RADIO.
BE CAREFUL OF THIS DAMN SHALE.
WATCH YOUR FOOTING, AND I MEAN IT.
IF YOUR HORSE GOES DOWN,
YOU DON'T GO WITH HIM.
THANKS FOR THE TIP.
WHOA, WHOA !
DON'T EVEN MOVE !
I TOLD YOU TO WATCH YOUR STEP !
YOU'RE NOT IN A CLASSROOM !
OUT HERE ONE LITTLE MISTAKE WILL GET YOU KILLED !
FEEL FREE
TO TAKE CHARGE, MR. GATES.
YOU SEE THAT ROPE ?
YEAH.
WELL, LET GO AND GRAB IT WITH BOTH HANDS.
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
JUST DO IT.
READY ?
YEAH.
ON THREE.
ONE...
TWO...
THREE !
ZIP !
ZIP !
LEAD THE HORSE.
GOOD BOY !
THAT'S IT.
GOOD BOY.
NOW PULL HER UP.
TAKE HER UP.
YOU OKAY ?
YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE...
DISCONCERTING TO REALIZE,
THE SMARTEST MEMBER OF OUR EXPEDITION IS A DOG.
SADDLE UP.
WE STILL GOT TWO HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT.
ZIP,
DO YOU WANNA TASTE ?
WANNA TASTE, HMM ?
LET ME GET YOU...
IS THAT GOOD ?
IS THAT GOOD ?
YOU WANT MORE ?
JESUS.
YOU'RE REALLY IN YOUR ELEMENT OUT HERE, AREN'T YOU ?
I LIKE THE SOLITUDE.
LATELY,
IT SEEMS THE ONLY TIME I'M AT EASE IS WHEN I GOT...
A HUNDRED DOLLAR MILES BETWEEN ME AND THE REST OF HUMANITY.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE BORN A CENTURY TOO LATE.
YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT MY WIFE USED TO SAY.
USED TO ?
SHE DIED A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
I'M SORRY.
WAS SHE ILL ?
UH-UH.
WE WERE RIDING IN THE BACK COUNTRY,
MAKING A RIVER CROSSING,
AND THE HORSE "SPOOKED" AND BUCKED HER.
I WENT IN AFTER HER.
THE CURRENT WAS TOO STRONG.
ONE SECOND SHE WAS THERE AND...
HER DAD STILL BLAMES ME TO THIS DAY.
WHAT MORE COULD YOU HAVE DONE ?
DROWNED.
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
EVER BEEN MARRIED ?
ONLY TO MY WORK.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF MEN.
SOME WORKED OUT AND SOME DIDN'T.
IT JUST ALWAYS HAD TO BE ON MY TERMS.
LADY,
IF I WAS BORN A CENTURY TOO LATE,
YOU WERE DEFINITELY BORN A CENTURY TOO EARLY.
( Briggs ) RUSSELL AND HIS WIFE CAME ACROSS IT BERRY PICKING.
MRS. BURTON SAID LEWIS WAS AT THE CHRONICLE THE OTHER DAY.
HE SPENT THREE HOURS GOING THROUGH OLD COPIES OF THE NEWSPAPER.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU UP TO, GATES ?
OH, YOU WANNA DRINK ?
LOVE ONE.
WHISKEY.
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT ONE THING.
WHY INDIANS ?
BECAUSE I ADMIRE THEM.
AND BECAUSE WE OWE THEM A TREMENDOUS DEBT.
HOW'S THAT ?
THEY GAVE US ROMANCE, MYTHS, LEGENDS.
THEY GAVE US A HISTORY.
THE INDIANS SHAPED THE CHARACTER OF OUR ENTIRE NATION.
WE PICKED A HELLUVA WAY TO SAY THANK YOU, DIDN'T WE ?
WHAT HAPPENED WAS INEVITABLE.
THE WAY IT HAPPENED WAS UNCONSCIONABLE.
WOULD THERE BE ANY WHISKEY LEFT ?
MY HEAD FEELS LIKE A PUNCHING BAG THANKS TO YOU.
I GOT SOME ASPIRIN.
OH, GREAT !
SOMETHING'S CHEWED A HOLE IN MY SLEEPING BAG.
TRACKS ?
WHAT ?
ON THE GROUND, HOW MANY TOES ?
FOUR.
IT'S PROBABLY SOME LITTLE CHIPMUNK.
CHIPMUNKS, MUSKRATS, SQUIRRELS--
THEY ALL HAVE FOUR TOES IN FRONT, FIVE IN THE BACK.
ALL THE OTHERS GOT FIVE AND FIVE.
WEASELS, THOUGH, THEY'RE A DIFFERENT STORY.
THEY TEND TO WALK ON THE BALLS OF THEIR FEET.
BALLS OF THEIR FEET.
LOOK.
WE'VE BEEN RIDING FOR A WEEK.
I AGREED TO THREE DAYS.
I THINK WE SHOULD HEAD BACK.
IT WAS A ROMANTIC IDEA--
INDIANS AND THE OXBOW.
I ADMIT I GOT CAUGHT UP MYSELF,
BUT,
WE HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN GO TRAIPSING AROUND
THESE MOUNTAINS LOOKING FOR GHOSTS.
IF ANYONE IN MY DEPARTMENT KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING OUT HERE
THEY'D HAVE ME COMMITTED !
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.
I HAVE CLASSES TO TEACH...
I HAVE A LIFE !
AS SOON AS WE'RE PACKED UP WE'RE HEADING BACK.
UNDERSTAND ?
GATES, HAVE YOU HEARD A WORD I'VE SAID ?
YOU WANNA GO BACK ?
YES !
I'M AN ANTHROPOLOGIST, NOT DANIEL BOONE !
HAVE YOU SEEN MY CANTEEN ?
WHERE'S THE CANTEEN ?
I HATE CAMPING !
GATES ?
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ?
HERE'S YOUR DAMN CANTEEN.
( dog barking )
GET DOWN !
DON'T !
NO-HU !
NO-HU !
( in Indian )
NO-HU !
MY GOD !
VERY SLOWLY...
TOSS DOWN YOUR PISTOL.
UH-UH.
DO IT.
DON'T MOVE.
DOES BREATHING COUNT ?
LOOK AT THEM.
( speaking in Indian )
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ?
I'M NOT SURE...
( in Indian )
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING HIM ?
I TOLD HIM WE COME IN A GOOD WAY, IN PEACE.
I ALSO TOLD HIM YOU WERE A GREAT WARRIOR
WHO WASN'T AFRAID TO FIGHT THEM ALL SINGLE-HANDEDLY.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
THE CHEYENNE ADMIRE BRAVERY.
LET'S JUST HOPE THEY DON'T PUT YOU TO THE TEST.
IF THEY DO, I'M COMIN' AFTER YOU FIRST !
( Zip barking )
DON'T MOVE !
NO !
HANG ON, BOY !
ZIP ?
NO, NO.
THEY'LL KILL YOU.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
THEY'RE CHEYENNE DOG SOLDIERS.
IN MY LIFE,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED...
AND YET HERE WE ARE.
A STEP BACK INTO HISTORY.
MY GOD, I FEEL PRIVILEGED.
I'M SORRY.
I GUESS I'M NOT SO TOUGH AFTER ALL.
LIKE HELL YOU'RE NOT.
SHE CAN'T WALK ANY FURTHER.
SHE NEEDS A HORSE.
A HORSE !
SHE'S WEAK.
SHE HAS TO RIDE !
LEWIS, I'LL BE FINE...
LISTEN, ASSHOLE !
EITHER SHE RIDES, OR YOU'RE GONNA KILL US RIGHT NOW !
YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND MY WORDS,
BUT YOU GET MY MEANING, DON'T YOU ?
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE ?
20 YEARS SHE SPENT WANDERIN' THE COUNTRY,
LOOKIN' AROUND THE WORLD, TEACHIN' AND WORKIN'
AND DOIN' GOOD IN PLACES JUST OFF THE FAR EDGE OF THE MAP.
TRYIN' TO FIND SOMETHIN' THAT WAS A WHOLE LOT CLOSER
THAN SHE THOUGHT.
LEWIS, HE NEVER WENT AS FAR AS LILLIAN.
BUT THESE LAST FEW YEARS,
EVEN WHEN HE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO YA,
HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKIN' FAR OFF.
NOW THE FARAWAY WAS COMIN' AWFUL CLOSE TO THEM BOTH,
AND BOTH HAD THE HOPE
IT'D BE AS GOOD AND AS SAFE AS THEIR DREAMS.
WHAT EVERY ONE OF US LOOKS FOR,
WHAT DAMN FEW OF US GETS TO SEE--
THAT'S WHAT'S JUST OVER THE FAR HORIZON.
( whistling )
THE TRICK IS TO KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT.
EVEN BIGGER TRICK,
KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.
LET ME TAKE HIM.
PLEASE, YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.
COME ON.
( yelling in Indian )
( in Indian )
WHATEVER YOU SAID, I HOPE IT'S FRIENDLY.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YEAH.
UNBELIEVABLE.
( Lillian ) IT'S NO USE.
THE INDIAN PREDATES THE BOY SCOUT !
THE KNOTS ARE SOLID.
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO WITH US ?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE THE EXPERT, REMEMBER ?
WELL, THEY COULD KILL US.
BUT TRADITIONALLY,
MANY CHEYENNE PRISONERS WERE JUST ABSORBED INTO THE TRIBE.
ABSORBED ?
YEAH, THEY TREATED THEIR PRISONERS SO WELL,
THEY OFTEN REFUSED TO GO HOME EVEN IF THEY HAD THE CHANCE.
YEAH, WELL,
THE HOSPITALITY OVERWHELMS ME !
WELL, YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM, REALLY.
THEY'RE AFRAID OF US.
HIS NAME IS ZIP.
LILLIAN, HOW DO YOU SAY THANK YOU ?
NYOW-ISH.
NYOW-ISH !
( moaning )
( in Indian )
THE WAY LEWIS FIGURED IT OUT,
"YELLOW WOLF" WAS NEAR BEIN' CHIEF
AND SURE TO BE CHIEF WHEN OLD "SPOTTED ELK" DIED.
THEY WERE CUT LOOSE ON THE OLD MAN'S SAY-SO.
OTHERWISE "YELLOW WOLF" WOULDA DONE A HELLUVA LOT MORE
THAN TIE 'EM UP.
OH...
( Lillian ) HE WANTS US TO FOLLOW HIM.
I'M NOT LEAVING MY DOG...
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
WHAT ?
THIS IS "SPOTTED ELK".
THE LAST SURVIVING SON OF "LONE WOLF".
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF WE'VE COME TO RETURN HIM
TO THE HOUSE OF "IRON BARS".
SEEMS WHEN HE WAS A SMALL BOY
HE WAS CAPTURED BY SOME WHITE MEN AND PUT IN A CAGE.
JACKO.
GET A LINE ON "MR. PERSONALITY" HERE ?
HIS NAME'S "YELLOW WOLF".
HE'S LEADER OF THE DOG SOLDIERS,
NEXT IN LINE TO BE CHIEF.
I GUESS IT TAKES A REAL MAN TO SHOOT A DOG.
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY THEY DIDN'T EAT HIM !
OH, DIDN'T I TELL YOU ?
THAT'S THE OTHER REASON THEY'RE CALLED "DOG SOLDIERS" !
THIS IS WHERE WE STAY.
( thunder booming )
( Spotted Elk talking )
( Lillian ) HE TELLS OF MANY CHEYENNE KILLED
OF HIS FATHER'S FLIGHT
FROM THE WHITE SOLDIERS.
THERE WAS A GREAT STORM...
THE INDIANS WERE LOST AND STARVING.
A WOLF APPEARED AND LED THEM TO THIS VALLEY.
THE WOLF SPOKE,
TELLING THEM TO REMAIN HERE,
HIDDEN FROM THE WHITE MAN
FOREVER.
THEY SURVIVED.
THIS WAS DURING THE MOON, WHEN THE DEER SHED THEIR HORNS.
128 WINTERS AGO.
( arguing )
WHAT'S GOIN' ON OVER THERE ?
I DON'T KNOW.
MY GOD.
THEY WERE HUNTING WHEN HIS SON GOT SEPARATED.
HE WAS SHOT BY THREE WHITE MEN.
"YELLOW WOLF" AND THE DOGMEN KILLED THEM.
HE'S BURNING UP.
THE INFECTION MUST BE SPREADING.
LILLIAN ?
TELL ME WHAT HE NEEDS.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND CONVINCE THEM,
AND I'LL RIDE.
HE SAYS THE DECISION IS NOT HIS.
IT'S GOOD YOU OFFER,
BUT HIS PEOPLE SURVIVED ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT THE WHITE MAN'S HELP.
TO ASK FOR IT NOW MIGHT MAKE SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN.
PENICILLIN, AS MUCH AS YOU CAN GET.
ISN'T THAT HARD TO COME BY WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION ?
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
RIGHT.
TELL HIM I NEED MY PISTOL.
NOW MY KNIFE.
LEWIS...
THE KNIFE.
OH, ONE MORE THING.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ?
!
THAT'S FOR ZIP.
THAT WAS STUPID.
WELL, I'M SORRY, LILLIAN.
BEFORE I DO SOMEBODY A FAVOR,
THE SCORE HAS TO BE EVEN.
THAT'S JUST THE WAY I AM.
( Lillian ) HE'LL RIDE WITH YOU PART OF THE WAY.
BE CAREFUL.
IF YOU DON'T COME BACK, I'LL BE KILLED.
IT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS.
AND "YELLOW WOLF",
HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING--
BEIN' CHIEF OR ANYTHING ELSE-- JUST TO SAVE HIS BOY.
LEWIS, HE FIGURED HE WAS GONNA HELP LILLIAN.
BUT HE HAD TO KNOW HE WAS RISKIN' MORE HIMSELF
THAN JUST GETTIN' CAUGHT.
HE WAS RISKIN' A DREAM.
AND I'LL TELL YA SOMETHIN' ABOUT LEWIS GATES.
LEWIS GATES IS JUST NO GOOD AT GIVIN' UP.
DAMN IT !
OKAY, GIRL ?
HE HAD TO "WHIP UP".
HE HAD TO MAKE TIME FOR THAT BOY.
NOW HE KNEW NOBODY CARED A DAMN ABOUT HIM,
AND NOBODY WOULD BE LOOKIN' FOR HIM.
BUT HE KNEW THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE LOOKIN' FOR LILLIAN.
HE DIDN'T WANNA BE AROUND WHEN THEY DID.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS HE COULD REMEMBER
THAT HE WANTED SOMETHIN'.
SOMETHIN' THAT SHOULDA BEEN EASY.
HE JUST WANTED TO GET THERE,
GET AWAY GET BACK.
WHOA, WHOA.
EASY.
EASY, GIRL.
( growling )
( horse whinnying )
WHOA !
WHOA, GIRL !
OH !
( honking )
YOU DID GOOD, GIRL.
WITH YA IN A MINUTE.
I SAID I'D BE...
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS COUNTRY.
NOBODY WORKS ANYMORE.
( police radio warble )
( radio ) ... silent alarm at Canmore drugs.
DON'T DO IT, BUDDY.
I'VE GOT GRANDCHILDREN.
RELAX, WILL YA ?
PENICILLIN, YOU GOT THAT ?
BAG IT UP.
GO ON.
HALT !
BRIGGS.
DON'T TRY ANYTHING.
I ALREADY CALLED FOR BACKUP.
WHY'D YOU GO AND DO THAT ?
NOW YOU JUST STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
PUT THAT AWAY BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEBODY.
NO MORE GAMES, LEWIS.
I'M TAKIN' YOU IN.
STOP THAT MAN !
HE JUST ROBBED ME !
RULE #1, BRIGGS,
NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE SUSPECT !
LEWIS, PULL OVER !
YOU PULL OVER !
( sirens blaring )
GET OUT OF THE WAY !
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN' ?
THEY THOUGHT PUTTIN' THAT HAT OUT WOULD BRING LEWIS UP SHORT.
BUT THAT WAS JUST ABOUT AS DUMB
AS SHOWIN' YOUR RED FLANNEL COVERED RUMP
TO A MEXICAN FIGHTIN' BULL.
LIKE I SAID,
LEWIS GATES IS JUST NO EARTHLY GOOD AT GIVIN' UP.
SHERIFF, LOOK AT THIS.
YOU THINK HE'S GONNA MAKE IT ?
IT'S TOO SOON TO KNOW.
OW !
OKAY.
"LEWIS GATES" WILDERNESS STEW.
GOOD !
AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, TOO.
HERE, TRY THAT.
AW, COME ON !
YOU TRY THEN.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING !
THAT'S VERY NICE, BUT I COULDN'T.
( Lillian ) THIS THEIR WAY OF SHOWING THANKS.
TO REFUSE A GIFT IS TO INSULT THEM.
NYOW-ISH.
VERY BEAUTIFUL.
LILLIAN, WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH ALL THIS STUFF ?
WHAT ALL RICH, ELIGIBLE BACHELORS DO.
FIND A WIFE AND SETTLE DOWN.
FUNNY, VERY FUNNY.
THE SHERIFF JUST COULDN'T GET OVER THE IDEA
THAT LEWIS HAD COST THE LIFE OF HIS DAUGHTER.
HE WAS MAD,
AND HE COULDN'T GET OVER THAT EITHER.
HE REFUSED TO ALLOW LEWIS TO HAVE ANY PEACE.
AND IF HE THOUGHT HE'D FOUND SOME,
WELL, THAT SHERIFF WOULD DO WHATEVER WAS NECESSARY
TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM.
JESUS.
ARE YOU SHOCKED ?
YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS ?
FOR A WHILE.
"SPOTTED ELK" BROUGHT ME HERE.
HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS.
WHEN GAME IS SCARCE, THEY'RE FORCED TO HUNT OUTSIDE THE VALLEY.
THAT'S WHEN THEY RUN INTO WHITE MEN.
THEY HIDE FROM MOST, BUT
THOSE THAT VENTURE TOO CLOSE...
END UP HERE.
WOULDN'T YOU KILL TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY
AND YOUR WAY OF LIFE ?
HE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE SILVER BIRD WITH THE LONG WHITE TAIL.
( in Indian )
I JUST TOLD THEM MAN WALKED ON THE MOON.
HE JUST CALLED ME A WONDERFUL LIAR !
WHAT IS IT ?
HE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT OTHER CHEYENNE, HOW THEY'RE LIVING.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM ?
THE TRUTH.
( helicopter approaching )
( horses whinnying )
( in Indian )
NO !
( screaming )
( wolf howling )
( Lillian ) DO YOU HEAR THAT ?
I'VE WAITED ALL MY LIFE TO HEAR THAT.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, LILLIAN ?
WE CAN'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THESE PEOPLE.
NO ONE MUST EVER FIND OUT.
NO ONE.
( yelling )
DEEGAN.
WHO ?
MY FATHER-IN-LAW.
I COVERED MY BACK TRAIL.
HOW DID THEY FIND IT ?
( Lillian ) HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE ?
THEY'RE THREE MILES FROM THE WATERFALL.
HALF A DAY, MAYBE LESS.
DAMN HIM !
( Lillian ) "SPOTTED ELK" WANTS TO LEAVE THE VALLEY
AND TRAVEL DEEPER INTO THE MOUNTAINS.
BUT "YELLOW WOLF" SAYS THERE IS NO TIME,
THEY SHOULD STAY AND FIGHT.
JESUS, THEY'LL GET SLAUGHTERED.
THE CHEYENNE, OR THE TROOPERS ?
WHAT IF WE CREATED A DIVERSION ?
MAYBE IT'D BUY 'EM SOME MORE TIME.
FROM THIS TIME ON,
DO NOT MISTREAT THE CHEYENNE.
THINK OF US IN A GOOD WAY.
ALL OF US ARE YOUR RELATIONS.
YOU EXCHANGE GIFTS IN THE CEREMONY.
LILLIAN,
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT EVERYTHING I OWN.
AHHH...
FROM THIS TIME ON, YOU ARE ONE OF THE "LIKE-HEARTED" PEOPLE.
YOU ARE CHEYENNE.
GO IN A GOOD WAY.
WHAT ?
I'M JUST THINKING HOW MUCH I'M GONNA MISS YOUR...
WILDERNESS STEW.
KNOCK IT OFF, LILLIAN.
SADDLE UP.
THIS IS ANOTHER JOURNEY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE ON YOUR OWN.
I'VE ASKED "SPOTTED ELK" IF I CAN STAY WITH THEM.
GET ON YOUR HORSE, LILLIAN.
NO.
MY WORK'S JUST BEGUN.
I WANT A LIVING RECORD SET DOWN,
A MEMORIAL,
TO THE LAST OF THEIR KIND.
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND ?
!
I'VE SPENT HALF MY LIFE TEACHING OTHERS.
NOW, OUT HERE, WITH THESE PEOPLE,
I'M THE STUDENT, I'M...
LIVING IT.
I BELONG WITH THEM.
I'M STAYING.
DAMN IT, LILLIAN.
WHY DON'T YOU ADMIT THE REAL REASON YOU'RE UPSET.
YOU'LL MISS ME.
LET'S GO, ZIP.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US.
ZIP.
OH, NOT YOU TOO.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS !
WELL,
I GUESS I ALWAYS KNEW A WOMAN'D COME BETWEEN US.
YOU'RE BETTER OFF HERE ANYWAY.
I GOT A FEELIN' I'M HEADED FOR TROUBLE.
TAKE CARE OF HER.
HE LIKES TO SLEEP WITH IT.
NYOW-ISH.
NYOW-ISH YOURSELF.
THIS OUGHTA HELP.
THAT LOOKS ANCIENT.
IS IT STILL GOOD ?
DYNAMITE...
IS LIKE WINE.
IT ONLY GETS BETTER WITH AGE.
JESUS !
EASY, EASY...
YOU SEE THIS ?
OVER TIME IT SWEATS.
NITRO.
BIG BOOM !
GOD !
WELL,
THIS IS GOOD-BYE.
LIL...
CAN YOU PROMISE ME SOMETHIN' ?
NO MATTER HOW BAD IT GETS,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
DON'T LET THEM EAT MY DOG !
I PROMISE.
SAY,
DO YOU REALLY WALK AROUND NAKED IN THE MORNIN' ?
DO WEASELS REALLY WALK AROUND ON THE BALLS OF THEIR FEET ?
!
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A GOOD-BYE KISS ?
I'D SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ?
YOU CALL THAT A KISS ?
!
WELL...
BETTER ?
I'M A GOOD STUDENT.
FINALLY HE KNEW WHAT HE HAD
AND EVERYTHING HE HAD TO GIVE UP TO KEEP IT.
AND THEY SAY YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU GOT 'TIL IT'S GONE,
BUT LEWIS KNEW.
HE COULD TAKE THE FULL MEASURE OF IT.
JUST ONE LAST TIME.
TO HOLD IT IN HIS HEART FOREVER.
AND IT WASN'T ONLY THE MEMORY HE MEANT TO KEEP ALIVE.
HE MEANT TO BE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER
COULD TOUCH WHAT HE'D COME TO LOVE.
MAKE DEAD SURE OF IT, IF HE HAD TO.
( gunshot )
( horses whinnying )
( cocking gun )
HOWDY, BILL.
LEWIS.
THAT TOO TIGHT ?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE CHEAP SHOT BACK IN TOWN.
NOTHIN' PERSONAL.
THERE WAS A CAVE HALFWAY UP.
IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WATERFALL.
ALL RIGHT, MEN !
MOUNT UP.
DEEGAN !
YOU'RE MAKIN' A MISTAKE.
YOU DO THIS, YOU'RE GONNA GET THESE MEN KILLED.
ALL RIGHT, MEN, LET'S MOVE OUT.
HYAH !
DROP IT !
I'LL KILL YOU WHERE YOU STAND !
DROP THE DAMN GUN !
DO IT NOW !
PUT IT DOWN GATES !
HE'S HURT BAD !
WHAT DO WE DO NOW, DEPUTY ?
WE'RE GOIN' BACK !
COME HERE !
GIMME A HAND !
I NEED SOME HELP HERE !
THEY DID SEND OUT AFTER LILLIAN, OF COURSE,
SEARCH PARTIES ALL OVER THE OXBOW.
AT LEAST 'TIL THE SNOWS SHUT 'EM DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN
WHAT LILLIAN FOUND WITH THOSE CHEYENNE,
AND I CAN'T SAY SHE FOUND ANYTHING.
BUT I FIGURE ONCE SHE GOT AMONG 'EM,
AT LEAST SHE CAME UPON A BETTER IDEA
ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS LOOKIN' FOR.
MAYBE SOME PIECE OF AN OLD WORLD IN THE NEW,
A BETTER WORLD.
A BETTER ONE FOR HER, ANYWAY.
THEY TELL ME THAT YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
YOU DID FOR ME WHAT YOU COULDN'T DO FOR MY DAUGHTER.
I WISH TO GOD IT WAS THE OTHER WAY.
I'M TIRED OF HATIN' YOU, LEWIS.
WHEN YOU'RE READY, I THINK MAYBE
IT'S TIME WE HAVE THAT TALK.
WELL,
NOBODY AROUND HERE, INCLUDING ME,
WANTS TO SEE YOU PUT AWAY FOR STEALIN' SOME PENICILLIN.
SO WE'RE DROPPIN' THE CHARGES.
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO KNOW.
IN THAT TUNNEL,
JUST BEFORE THE EXPLOSION,
I THOUGHT THAT I SAW...
WHAT'S OUT THERE ?
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS OUT THERE ?
OKAY.
FINE.
WHATEVER YOU'RE PROTECTING,
I HOPE IT'S WORTH IT.
AND FOR HIM, MAYBE TOO.
HE BOUGHT ME A DRINK,
TOLD ME WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART AS NEAR AS HE KNEW IT,
AND THEN HE RODE OFF TO RECKON WITH WHATEVER HE MIGHT FIND.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S EVER LUCKY ENOUGH
TO COME ON THE SAME DREAM TWICE.
BUT SOMETIMES IN THE TWILIGHT,
I LOOK UP TOWARDS THE OXBOW,
TRY TO SEE PAST THE MOUNTAINS--
STRAIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE WEST,
WHERE MAYBE LEWIS GATES HAS GOT TO.
OF COURSE, I CAN'T,
BUT THAT DON'T MEAN HE HASN'T FOUND IT.
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA PUT YOUR FAITH IN WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE.
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU WISH.
PUT YOUR HOPE SOMEWHERE SAFE.
LIKE SOMEWHERE I HOPE LOUIS GATES IS.
( Zip barking )
I'd say most of what I'm tellin' ya is true.
And the rest--
Well, the rest is the West.
Now, of course, I didn't believe it either... when Lewis told me-- not right off.
I'm no damn fool, and Lewis Gates... he knows not to take me for one.
Lewis, hell, he's the kind of fella tells you a story--
Well, you wanna keep one eye on him and the other over his shoulder... lookin' out for anyone comin' to settle with him.
And you'd better keep your hand on your drink too... 'cause Lewis has carried a considerable thirst around the last few years.
Now I told my own share of stories, and I heard a lot too... but this one--
This one Lewis told me, I never heard the like.
Wherever they get to, all good stories begin and end in the same place... and that's the heart of a man, or a woman.
Now, we'll get there in a little time, but this is a Western story.
At least, it starts and ends in the West.
So it begins the way all Western stories ought to-- with outlaws.
- You boys have any luck?
- "Needle in a haystack" ring a bell?
Try down there by Buck Creek.
They might have gotten that far.
Ten-four.
I want those bastards found.
They're in the truck.
Help me get this off, will you?
Sheriff, they killed one of the guards.
They cut his throat.
Jesus.
Keep his head up.
What do you figure they'll do?
Keep runnin', make for the border... buy a little condo on a lake somewhere... and live happily ever after.
There's only one thing standing in their way.
Four thousand square miles of the roughest country...
God ever put on a map.
There's not a road, not a town.
Hell, there's places out there haven't even seen a footprint.
- Sheriff?
- Down there!
- Who are those guys?
- Write this down.
Find Gates.
Lewis Gates?
But I thought that you--
Just find him.
Yes, sir.
Rise and shine, Lewis.
What are you lookin' at?
You were supposed to stop me after three, remember?
I don't think Lewis ever took that damn hat off for nothin', ever.
I hope you remember where we parked 'cause I sure don't.
Now I don't know what it was that it really meant to him... but let me tell you this--
I never saw him wear that hat before he got married... and after she died, well-- well, I never saw him without it.
He wore it proud-- kind of the way a woman would wear a wedding ring.
I didn't do it, and whoever said I did is a liar.
A busload of state prisoners went off the highway near Logan Pass last night.
Three escaped.
They headed straight into the Oxbow.
I don't do that kind of work anymore.
Lewis, wait!
The FBI showed up.
Lewis, they need one brought out alive.
Deegan himself sent me to find you.
Tell Deegan he can kiss my ass.
- You're gonna have to do that yourself.
- Briggs.
Just talk to him.
Otherwise, he'll chew my butt.
Lewis, please.
Deegan, I'm tellin' you what I told your deputy.
Not interested.
Now you listen good.
I need you on this one.
Drunk or sober... you're the best tracker in the state.
You always were a charmer.
-Briggs, is that mangy dog of his there?
- He could use a bath, sir.
Well, I just got a complaint that he's been chasin' deer again.
Now I want you to take Mr. Gates down to the county lockup.
Fifteen days for wildlife harassment... and failure to obey the leash law.
- Leash law?
- You shouldn't provoke him, Lewis.
Hell, I shouldn't do a lot of things I end up doin'.
Are you goin' in after them convict fellas?
Yeah, it appears I am.
My cousin walked into them mountains 20 years ago.
Never come out.
Any message in case I come across him?
Yeah!
Tell him I've run off with his wife.
Come on, Zip.
Where'd they go in?
The bottom of the ravine.
Dogs lost the trail at the north fork.
Armed?
More than likely.
Twelve-gauge pump and .357 still unaccounted for.
That'll be 4,000 cash per man, plus expenses.
You'll get what you're always paid.
Not a dime more.
Come on, Zip.
I guess we're goin' to jail.
Sheriff.
I don't give a shit about the other two.
Sears comes out alive.
If there's one scratch on him, you don't even get horse feed.
I'll treat him with kid gloves.
There was real trouble between Lewis and the sheriff.
Family stuff-- the kind that runs deeper than any wound.
For every time the sheriff saw Lewis... he remembered the loss of his daughter.
He loved her, and he blamed Lewis for that loss.
But no more than Lewis mourned the same loss or blamed himself.
He hated himself for it.
What are you waiting' for?
Go on.
Get to work.
Good boy, Zip.
Looks like we weren't the only ones who got thirsty.
Four legs or two?
Go on.
Check it out!
Damn it, Zip!
I almost let the air out of ya.
Make some noise next time, will ya?
Hey, it's my hat, you know.
Howdy, boys.
Oh, relax.
They ain't goin' anywhere.
We'll go up and grab them at first light.
Besides, I'm beat.
Tomorrow we cash in, Zippy.
Maybe we'll finally get that log cabin built.
Think you could handle a real roof over your head?
'Course, this ain't such a bad roof either.
What happened next, Lewis told me, was like a dream... coming at ya all at once, everything happening at the same time.
And damned if he didn't think it was a dream.
At first, anyway.
What is it?
Somebody's out there.
And the kid?
Leave him.
He won't be back.
Hell, no.
Not with a gut full of buckshot.
What the hell was that?
- Hey!
- I'm gettin' out of here!
Goddamn it!
Come on!
Shit!
Who are you?
Who are you?
Holding that arrow in his hand, he knew he wasn't dreaming.
It was more like he had finally woke up... and there was finally something straight and simple... pointing the way.
I was beginnin' to wonder about you.
- Sears give you any trouble?
- No trouble at all.
You know, we never talked about what happened.
We should have.
There's nothin' to talk about.
My daughter's dead.
Now, where's my man?
You want the rest of him... you go out there and find him yourself.
What the hell is this?
That's all that's left of your runners.
- What?
- They're dead.
All of 'em?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
- Goddamn it, don't play games!
- I don't know!
I was movin' in.
Everything was fine.
Then I heard gunshots.
When I got to where they should have been... all I found was that shirt... and enough blood on the ground to paint this office.
No bodies.
Nothin'.
You expect me to believe this cock-and-bull story?
I don't give a damn what you believe.
All I know is that I've wasted four days, and I'm out 12 grand.
- Where you goin'?
- Sheriff?
- I need a drink.
- Sheriff, Gates is--
- Just leavin'.
- I'm not finished with you!
I want some answers!
That makes two of us.
Shit.
I'm lookin' for Professor Sloan.
Over there.
Where's Professor Sloan?
Uh, over that way.
Excuse me, I'm lookin' for Professor Sloan.
Excuse me.
Where the hell is Professor Sloan?
And please don't ask me to go over there.
I've already been over there.
And over there and over there.
Who wants to know?
Give me a break, lady.
Took me three and a half hours to drive up here to meet this guy.
I'm about ready to sic my dog on somebody.
You call that a dog?
Will somebody just point out the old fart?
L.D. Lillian Diane.
You're not the first person to make that mistake, Mr.--
Gates.
Lewis Gates.
All right.
Take this to Sandy, and have her clean it up by tonight.
Okay?
Good work.
So, Mr. Gates, what can this old fart do for you?
You don't really look like a professor.
- So where'd you find this?
- In the Oxbow.
The Oxbow.
Wasn't that just in the news?
Something about convicts?
Yeah.
I'm the guy they hired to find 'em.
Bounty hunter?
Please, civil servant.
It sounds a little less--
Barbaric?
I tracked 'em for four days.
Their trail ended in a meadow 20 miles in.
Somebody got to those men before I did.
There was blood everywhere and that.
That's quite a story.
You know what this is?
Well, call it a wild guess.
An arrow?
A Cheyenne arrow.
Dog soldier, to be exact.
Dog soldier?
Within the Cheyenne tribe, there used to be a military society... made up of the strongest and bravest men.
They were fierce fighters-- unyielding.
They called themselves chotometnea-- dogmen.
The cavalry called them dog soldiers or suicide soldiers.
They often acted as rear guards, sort of sacrificial decoys... so the rest of the tribe could escape, see?
What does it mean?
Nothing.
Except maybe another "civil servant" beat you to those men.
So what about this?
An authentic reproduction.
About $15 in any tourist shop.
I saw somethin' in that meadow.
What?
Exactly.
I don't know.
It's just that later I found horse tracks.
And what's so unusual about that?
They weren't shod.
I checked with the forest service... and nobody's running stock up in that country.
And nobody rides unshod horses except--
Indians.
That's what you're implying, isn't it?
- Well--
- You don't seriously believe...
Cheyenne dog soldiers are running loose in the Oxbow.
Do you?
No, of course not.
I'm just, uh-
- I'm not a nutcase, okay?
- I'm sorry I can't help you, but--
- Come back here!
Drop that bone!
Drop it!
Get back here!
ls that your dog?
Give it back to him, Zip.
The group from the institute's here, Doctor.
I'll be right there.
Mr. Gates, it's been entertaining.
Drive carefully.
Somebody killed those men, Doctor.
It wasn't me, and it wasn't another bounty hunter.
Sorry.
Are you always this persistent?
I got halfway home before turning' back.
Call it gut instinct.
And what's this gut instinct of yours telling you?
You're not telling me everything.
You want something to drink?
Thought you'd never ask.
Well, I'm not hiding anything... you wouldn't eventually uncover.
Give me that!
Let go!
So I'm willing to satisfy your curiosity... if you promise not to bother me again.
Deal.
Mineral water.
It's good for you.
Here we are.
By late 1864, many tribes were raiding settlements... stealing horses, making a general nuisance of themselves.
But one of the few Cheyenne chiefs... really trying to make peace was Black Kettle.
He and his people were instructed to make camp at Sand Creek near Fort Lion.
They'd been promised protection, so that night they had a feast... with dancing and games to celebrate peace.
The following dawn, November 29, was freezing.
A group of Colorado volunteers known as the Bloodless Third... surrounded the camp.
They were instructed to take off their coats.
Strange, huh?
Black Kettle immediately raised an American flag and a white flag of peace.
People were rushing around in great panic and fear... and he kept calling out not to be frightened.
They'd been promised protection, and there was no danger.
Suddenly, the troops attacked.
Now, two thirds of these Indians were women and children.
It was total chaos.
It was massacre.
Blood froze instantly on the bodies... and then looting began.
Scalps were taken.
Fingers, ears, noses cut off.
Babies were cut out of the wombs.
Women had their uteruses cut off, and the soldiers wore them on their hats.
As a matter of fact, when they put their clean coats back on... they paraded through Denver... with body parts decorating their uniforms and horses.
Jesus.
Among the few that escaped Sand Creek were 20 men, women and children... led by Lone Wolf, leader of the dolmen.
The soldiers chased them northward through two states... right up into the mountains of northwestern Montana.
A blizzard forced them to turn back, and they left the Indians for dead.
Here.
Lone Wolf.
There.
Now you know everything there is to know.
It's late.
I'm tired.
Good night.
Wait a minute.
Don't you see?
It all adds up.
- What?
- Just suppose.
What if by a fluke, or a miracle--
What if Lone Wolf and those Cheyenne did survive?
isn't it possible their descendants could remain hidden in the Oxbow?
- They didn't survive.
- How do you know?
They were starving in a hostile environment.
Winter.
Only the clothes on their backs.
They didn't survive.
You sure of that?
If there were Indians in the Oxbow... don't you think someone would have seen them by now?
Not necessarily.
You are a nutcase.
No.
Look at the wolf.
Now we know wolves exist in the Oxbow, okay?
I found their tracks, I've heard their howls.
I even found the spot where one watched my camp for half a day.
- But I've never seen one.
- That's not the same.
- It is the same.
- It's not the same.
Look.
Elvis is dead... the government isn't hiding UFOs... and there are no Cheyenne dog soldiers living in the Oxbow.
Why are you being so goddamn pigheaded?
Because I'm goddamn good at it.
Look.
I know you saw something out there you can't explain.
I do believe that.
But I can't invest time and energy in pure fantasy.
I rely on facts.
Now, we're both tired.
I'm going to bed.
You're welcome to the couch... but I should warn you...
I tend to walk around naked in the morning.
These files contain copies of every issue we ever published.
Ninety-three years' worth.
There ya are, son.
- Happy hunting'.
- Thank you.
"Half-starved.
Nicknamed 'Jacko.'
Doesn't speak a word of English"?
- Good morning.
- Hi.
How are you doing today, Mr. Hollis?
When are they gonna put some goddamn fish in this river?
Oh, you know, I talked to the game warden... and he assures me that this river is full of fish.
Yeah, well, he's a liar.
Why, when I was a kid, we'd come here--
Mr. Hollis, this is Mr. Gates.
He's gonna visit with you for a while.
Full of fish, my ass.
Who the hell are you?
Wonder that myself sometimes.
Hand me one of them night crawlers, will ya?
Yes, sir.
So I understand you used to work for the railroad.
Not just any railroad, son.
The great Northern Pacific.
Fifty-three years.
Mr. Hollis... tell me about Jacko.
Well, I'll be damned.
- You remember, then?
- Remember?
I caught the little runt.
What happened?
Been a hell of a lot of years since I thought of that.
'35, I think it was.
Me and old Ed Valle, we was headed up the Kootenai.
Spur line needed some work.
Sometime past noon... we spotted somethin' run across the tracks.
First I thought it was a deer.
Then I seen it was a boy.
Well, Ed stopped the train... and we lit out after him.
Hey, there he is!
We chased him a ways... and finally cornered him down along the river.
Soon as we got close, we seen it was an Indian.
Didn't speak English.
Just sort of grunted.
What did you do with him?
Well, me and Ed didn't know what to do with him.
He was cold and tired... so I wrapped him in my shirt.
We'd brung him down to Sheriff Case.
He stuck him in a cell... 'cause he didn't have no other place to put him.
We nicknamed him "Jacko"... 'cause his face kind of looked wide-eyed and scared... like a jack-o'-lantern.
Next morning... he was gone.
We figured he squeezed out through the bars during the night.
Well, that was the end of it.
Nobody ever seen him again.
'Course the sheriff contacted some of the local reservations... but nothin' ever come of it.
Seemed like nobody knew who the boy was... nor where he come from.
Where do you think he came from?
Hell, I don't know.
But you tell me... what's an Indian boy who don't speak a word of English doin'... way out in the middle of nowhere... 60 miles from the nearest town?
This photo was taken just after the Cheyenne girls arrived... at the Indian school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
The same girls, 14 months later.
Their hair was cut, they were given Christian names... and forbidden to speak in their native tongue.
So began the government's policy... in dealing with the conquered plains tribes--
the policy of, um-- the policy of assimilation... both religious and cultural.
We need to talk.
Look at this.
Seventeen people disappeared... in the Oxbow since 1898.
Seventeen people.
Doesn't that seem a little odd?
Do you always wear that hat?
There's more.
1935.
A young Indian boy was found on the edge of the Oxbow.
Didn't speak a word of English.
I talked to the man who caught him.
An Indian boy who doesn't speak English and vanishes without a trace.
Explain that one.
You rely on facts.
isn't that what you told me?
These are the facts.
What do you want from me?
I'm going back in.
If my hunch is right, I don't wanna end up on that list.
I need someone along who speaks Cheyenne.
- One of your students?
- No.
Oh, no.
All I'm askin' for is a few days.
We ride in, we take a look around, we ride back out.
Three days.
If they're out there, I have to know.
And, goddamn it, so do you.
- Mornin'.
- Folks, I'm in a bit of a rush, so--
Come on.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Relax.
He seems capable enough.
I don't trust him.
Let's mount up.
We got a long ride ahead of us.
Good luck, Doctor.
Excuse me.
What the hell are you doin'?
I'm checkin' the stirrup.
Oh, no.
No way.
Hey, kid, get back down here!
Don't listen to him, John.
I'll see you in three days.
You go on now.
Like you said, if they're in there, I have to know.
This ain't gonna be a picnic, lady.
I seen this country reduce grown men to tears.
It ain't no place for a woman!
You really are a cowboy, aren't you?
What is it you fellas say?
We're burnin' daylight.
Talkin' about her-- and he talked about her a lot-- he always called her Lillian.
Kind of formal, like he wanted to keep his distance.
Oh, he knew her.
By instinct, he knew her.
And she knew him the same way-- wanderers, both of 'em, or searchers.
Now they had somethin' particular to look for... and there was a chance they'd find what they'd always been lookin' for.
Maybe we should rest.
If you're tired.
Smells, uh, interesting.
What is it?
Lewis Gates' wilderness stew.
Uh-huh, and what's in Lewis Gates' wilderness stew?
Anything that ain't nailed down.
You know, when I was a kid...
I hated the idea of camping out.
I mean, anything that crawled or buzzed scared me to death.
So what do I do?
I choose a career that keeps me outdoors 80% of the time.
You know, it's funny how things turn out.
Now I find being in the wilderness so invigorating, life-affirming, really.
Jesus.
Wonder Woman.
I've got some aspirin.
- I don't need any aspirin, thank you.
- Boy, aren't we in a great mood?
Just because I let you ride along doesn't mean I have to like it.
Now stop treating me like a child.
I didn't realize I was.
Thank you.
"A.G."?
Abraham Gates-- my grandfather.
You really hang on to things.
Some things.
- Well?
- Not bad.
- Mmm.
- If you don't mind the taste.
All right.
I heard that.
From now on, you cook your own supper.
How's that?
ls he always like this?
Good night, Gates.
Good night, Doc.
You're not gonna walk around naked in the mornin', are ya?
I'll try to restrain myself.
Oh, this is where I found the arrow and the tracks.
I guided elk hunters in this far, but never went beyond that ridge.
And that's the direction where the tracks were headed.
I wonder how long this weather'll keep up.
Eighty percent chance of rain through tonight, clearing by tomorrow.
Really?
An old Indian trick?
KQRP, all-news radio.
Be careful of this damn shale.
Watch your footing', and I mean it.
If your horse goes down... you don't go with him.
Thanks for the tip.
Whoa!
Don't even move!
I told you to watch your step!
You're not in a classroom!
Out here, one little mistake will get ya killed!
Feel free to take charge, Mr. Gates.
Do you see that rope?
Yeah.
Well, let go and grab it with both hands.
What about you?
Don't worry about me!
Just do it!
- Ready?
- Yeah!
On three!
One... two, three!
Lead the horse!
Good boy!
That's it!
Good boy!
Pull her up!
Take her up!
You okay?
Yeah.
I guess.
It's just a little disconcerting to realize that... the smartest member of our expedition's the dog.
Saddle up.
We still got two hours of daylight left.
Do you want a taste?
Want a taste?
Hmm?
Here, Zip.
Let me get you--
ls that good?
- Yeah?
You want more?
- Jesus.
You're really in your element out here, aren't ya?
I like the solitude.
Lately, it seems the only time I'm at ease... is when I got a hundred miles between me and the rest of humanity.
Sounds like you were born a century too late.
Yeah.
That's what my wife used to say.
Used to?
She died a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry.
Was she ill?
Mm-mm.
We were ridin' in the back country... makin' a river crossing'... and the horse bucked her.
I went in after her.
Current was too strong.
One second, she was there, and--
Her dad still blames me to this day.
What more could you have done?
Drowned.
What about you?
Ever been married?
Only to my work.
Don't get me wrong.
There have been plenty of men.
Some worked out, and some didn't.
It just always had to be on my terms.
Lady, if I was born a century too late... you were definitely born a century too early.
Russell and his wife came across it berry picking.
Mrs. Burton said Lewis was in The Chronicle the other day.
He spent three hours going through old copies of the newspaper.
What the hell are you up to, Gates?
Oh, you want a drink?
Love one.
Whiskey.
It's good for you.
Kind of curious about one thing.
Why Indians?
Oh, because I admire them.
And because we owe them a tremendous debt.
- How's that?
- Well, they gave us romance... myths, legends.
They gave us a history.
The Indians shaped the character of our entire nation.
We picked a hell of a way to say thank you, didn't we?
What happened was inevitable.
The way it happened... was unconscionable.
Would there be any whiskey left?
My head feels like a punching bag, thanks to you.
I got some aspirin.
Oh, great.
Something's chewed a hole in my sleeping bag.
- Tracks?
- What?
On the ground.
How many toes?
Four.
Ah, it's probably some little chipmunk.
Chipmunks, muskrats, squirrels.
They all have four toes in front, five in the back.
All the others got five and five.
Weasels, though, they're a different story.
They tend to walk on the balls of their feet.
Balls of their feet.
Look.
We've been riding for a week.
I agreed to three days.
I think we should head back.
It was a romantic idea-- Indians in the Oxbow.
I admit I got caught up myself.
But we have better things to do than go traipsing around these mountains... looking for ghosts.
If anyone in my department knew what I was doing out here... they'd have me committed.
I don't know why I let you talk me into this.
I have classes to teach.
I have a life.
As soon as we're packed up, we're heading back.
Understand?
Gates, have you heard a word I've said?
You wanna go back?
Yes.
I'm an anthropologist, not Daniel Boone.
Have you seen my canteen?
Where's the canteen?
I hate camping.
What is the matter with you?
Here's your canteen.
Get down!
No, don't.
My God.
Very slowly... toss down your pistol.
- Uh-uh.
- Do it.
- Now, don't move.
- Does breathing count?
Look at them.
What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.
- What?
What are you telling him?
I told him we come in a good way, in peace.
I also told him you were a great warrior... who wasn't afraid to fight them all single-handedly.
You've got to be kidding.
The Cheyenne admire bravery.
Let's just hope they don't put you to the test.
If they do, I'm coming after you first.
- Zip.
- Don't move.
Hang on, boy.
Hang on.
No, they'll kill you.
You were right.
They're Cheyenne dog soldiers.
In my life...
I never would have believed.
And yet, here we are.
A step back into history.
My God, I feel privileged.
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm not so tough after all.
Like hell you're not.
She can't walk any further.
She needs a horse.
A horse!
She's weak.
She has to ride.
- Lewis, I'll be fine.
- Listen, asshole... either she rides... or you're gonna kill both of us right now.
You might not understand my words, but you get my meaning, don't you?
What's it gonna be?
Twenty years she'd spent wandering the country... looking around the world, teaching and working... and doing good in places just off the far edge of the map... trying to find something that was a whole lot closer than she thought.
Now, Lewis, he never went as far as Lillian.
But these last few years, even when he was right next to you... he was always looking far off.
Now, the faraway was coming awful close to them both... and both had the hope it would be as good and as safe as their dreams.
Whatever one of us looks for... and what damn few of us gets to see... that's what's just over the far horizon.
Trick is to know it when you see it.
An even bigger trick-- know what to do about it.
Let me take him.
Please.
You're exhausted.
Come on.
Whatever you said, I hope it's friendly.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
It's no use.
The Indian predates the Boy Scout.
The knots are solid.
What are they gonna do with us?
I don't know.
But you're the expert, remember?
Well, they could kill us.
But traditionally, many Cheyenne prisoners were absorbed into the tribe.
- Absorbed?
- Yeah.
They treated their prisoners so well... they often refused to go home even if they had the chance.
Yeah, well... their hospitality overwhelms me.
You can't blame them, really.
They're afraid of us.
His name is Zip.
How do you say "thank you"?
The way Lewis figured it out...
Yellow Wolf was near being chief and sure to be chief... when old Spotted Elk died.
They were cut loose on the old man's say-so.
Otherwise, Yellow Wolf would have done a hell of a lot more... than just tie 'em up.
- He wants us to follow him.
- I'm not leaving my dog.
You don't have a choice.
This is Spotted Elk... the last surviving son of Lone Wolf.
He wants to know if we've come to return him to the house of iron bars.
Seems when he was a small boy, he was captured by white men and put in a cage.
Did you get a line on Mr. Personality here?
His name's Yellow Wolf.
He's leader of the dog soldiers-- next in line to be chief.
I guess it takes a real man to shoot a dog.
You should be happy they didn't eat him.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
That's the other reason they're called dog soldiers.
This is where we stay.
It tells of many Cheyenne killed... of his father's flight from the white soldiers.
There was a great storm.
The Indians were lost and starving.
A wolf appeared... and led them to this valley.
The wolf spoke... telling them to remain here... hidden from the white man... forever.
They survived.
This was during the moon... when the deer shed their horns.
A hundred and twenty-eight winters ago.
What's going on over there?
I don't know.
My God.
They were hunting, when his son got separated.
He was shot by three white men.
Yellow Wolf and the dogmen killed them.
He's burning up.
- The infection must me spreading.
- Lillian... tell me what he needs.
Why don't you try to convince them, and I'll ride.
He's says the decision's not his.
It's good you offer, but his people have survived... all this time without the white man's help.
To ask for it now might make something bad happen.
Penicillin.
As much as you can get.
isn't that hard to come by without a prescription?
Use your imagination.
Right.
Tell him I need my pistol.
And now my knife.
- Lewis, I don't think that's--
- The knife.
Oh, one more thing.
- What are you doing?
- That's for Zip.
- That was stupid.
- I'm sorry, Lillian.
Before I do somebody a favor, the score has to be even.
That's just the way I am.
He'll ride with you part of the way.
Be careful.
If you don't come back, I'll be killed.
It's just the way he is.
Yellow Wolf, he was willing... to give up anything, being chief or anything else... just to save his boy.
Lewis, he figured he was going to help Lillian.
But he had to know he was risking more than just getting caught.
He was risking a dream.
And I'll tell you something about Lewis Gates-
- He's no good at giving up.
Damn it.
Okay, girl?
He had to whip up.
He had to make time for that boy.
He knew nobody cared a damn about him, and nobody'd be looking for him.
But he knew that everybody'd be looking for Lillian.
He didn't want to be around when they did.
It was the first time in years... he could remember that he wanted something... something that should have been easy.
He just wanted to get there... get away... get back.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
Easy.
Easy, girl.
You did good, girl.
With you in a minute.
I said I'd be--
That's the problem with this country-- Nobody works anymore.
6-1-1. 6-1-1.
Silent alarm at Canmore Drugs. 213 West Main.
Don't do it, buddy.
I've got grandchildren.
Relax, will you?
Penicillin-- you got that?
Bag it up.
Go on.
Halt!
Don't try anything.
I already called for backup.
Why did you do that?
You just stay right where you are.
Put that away before you hurt somebody.
No more games, Lewis.
- I'm taking you in.
- Stop that man!
He just robbed me!
Rule number one, Briggs-- Never take your eyes off the suspect.
Lewis, pull over!
You pull over!
Get out of the way!
What are you doing?
They thought putting that hat out would bring Lewis up short.
But that's about as dumb as showing... your red flannel-covered rump to a Mexican fighting bull.
See, like I said--
Lewis Gates is just no earthly good at giving up.
Sheriff, look at this.
Do you think he's going to make it?
It's too soon to know.
Okay.
Lewis Gates' wilderness stew.
Good!
It's good for you too.
Here, try that.
Oh, come on.
Hey.
Now you try it.
You don't know what you're missing.
It's very nice, but really, I couldn't.
This is their way of showing thanks.
To refuse their gifts is to insult them.
Very beautiful.
Lillian, what am I going to do with all this stuff?
What all rich, eligible bachelors do-- find a wife and settle down.
Yeah, funny.
Very funny.
The sheriff just couldn't get over the idea... that Lewis had cost the life of his daughter.
He was mad... and he couldn't get over that either.
He refused to allow Lewis to have any peace.
And if he thought he'd found some... that sheriff would do whatever was necessary to take it away from him.
Jesus.
Are you shocked?
You knowed about this?
For a while.
Spotted Elk brought me here.
He was curious about some of the things.
When game is scarce, they are forced to hunt outside the valley.
That's when they run into white men.
They hide from most, but... those that venture too close--
End up here.
Wouldn't you kill to protect your family and your way of life?
He wants to know about the silver bird with the long, white tail.
I just told them man walked on the moon.
He just called me a wonderful liar.
- What is it?
- He wants to know about other Cheyenne.
How they're living.
What are you going to tell them?
The truth.
Do you hear that?
I've waited all my life to hear that.
You know something, Lillian?
We can't let anything happen to these people.
No one must ever find out.
No one.
- Who?
- My father-in-law.
I covered my back trail.
How did they find it?
-How much time do we have?
-They're three miles from the waterfall.
Half a day.
Maybe less.
Damn him!
Spotted Elk wants to leave the valley and travel deeper into the mountains.
But Yellow Wolf says there's no time.
They should stay and fight.
Jesus.
They'll get slaughtered.
The Cheyenne or the troopers?
What if we created a diversion?
Maybe it'd buy 'em some more time.
From this time on... do not mistreat the Cheyenne.
Think of us in a good way.
All of us are your relations.
You exchange gifts in the ceremony.
They've already got everything I own.
From this time on, you are one of the like-hearted people.
You are Cheyenne.
Go in a good way.
What?
I was just thinking how much I'm going to miss your... wilderness stew.
Knock it off, Lillian.
Saddle up.
I'm afraid this is another journey you're gonna have to make on your own.
I've asked Spotted Elk if I can stay with them.
Get on your horse.
No.
My work's just begun.
I want a living record set down... a memorial to the last of their kind.
- Have you lost your mind?
- I spent half my life teaching others.
Now, out here with these people, I'm the student.
I'm living it.
I belong with them.
I'm staying.
Damn it, Lillian.
Why don't you admit the real reason you're upset?
You'll miss me.
Let's go, Zip.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Oh, not you too.
I don't believe this.
I guess I always knew a woman would come between us.
You're better off here anyway.
I got a feeling I'm headed for trouble.
You take care of her.
He likes to sleep with it.
leesh yourself.
This ought to help.
That looks ancient.
ls it still good?
Dynamite?
It's like wine.
It only gets better with age.
Jesus!
Hey, hey.
Easy.
Easy.
You see this?
Over time it sweats.
Nitro.
Big boom!
God.
This is good-bye.
Could you promise me something?
No matter how bad it gets, no matter what happens...
I don't want them to eat my dog.
I promise.
You really walk around naked in the morning?
Do weasels really walk around on the balls of their feet?
What would you say to a good-bye kiss?
I'd say it's about time.
What the hell was that?
You call that a kiss?
Better.
I'm a good student.
Finally he knew what he had... and everything he had to give up to keep it.
They say you never know what you got till it's gone, but Lewis knew.
He could take the full measure of it just one last time... to hold it in his heart forever... and it wasn't only the memory he meant to keep alive.
He meant to be sure that no one else ever could touch... what he'd come to love.
Make dead sure of it if he had to.
Howdy, Bill.
That too tight?
Sorry about the cheap shot back in town.
Nothing personal.
There's a cave halfway up.
It goes all the way through the waterfall.
All right, men.
Mount up.
You're making a mistake.
You do this, you're gonna get these men killed.
All right, men.
Let's move out.
Stop him!
Stop!
Come on!
Drop it!
I'll kill you where you stand!
Drop the damn gun!
Do it now!
Put it down, Gates.
He's hurt bad!
What do we do now, Deputy?
We're going back!
Give me a hand!
I need some help here!
They did send out after Lillian, of course-- search parties all over the Oxbow... at least till the snows shut 'em down.
I don't know for certain what Lillian... found with those Cheyenne, and I can't say she found anything.
But I figure that once she got among 'em... at least she came upon a better idea about what she was looking for.
Maybe some piece of an old world in the new.
A better world.
A better one for her, anyway.
They tell me that you saved my life.
You did for me what you couldn't do for my daughter.
I wish to God it was the other way.
I'm tired of hating you, Lewis.
When you're ready, I think that maybe it's time we have that talk.
Now... nobody around here, including me... wants to see you put away for stealing some penicillin, for Christ sake.
So we're dropping the charges.
But there's something I have to know.
In that tunnel... just before the explosion, I thought that I saw--
What's out there?
What do you think is out there?
Okay.
Fine.
Whatever you're protecting...
I hope it's worth it.
And for him maybe too.
He bought me a drink, told me what was in his heart... as near as he knew it... and then he rode off to reckon with whatever he might find.
I don't know if anyone's ever lucky enough... to come on the same dream twice.
But sometimes in the twilight...
I'll look up toward the Oxbow... try to see past the mountains... straight into the heart of the West, where maybe Lewis Gates has got to.
'Course, I can't... but that don't mean he hasn't found it.
Sometimes you got to put your plain faith in what you can't see.
Sometimes you just have to believe in what you wish... put your hope somewhere it's safe... like somewhere I hope Lewis Gates is.
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.
That's why I like soup.
First of all, it looks half-digested so you feel like half the work is done already.
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out with an IV line of soup that you could just jam right into your arm, you know?
Campbell's tomato intravenous.
Mainline gumbo.
Everyone just sitting around at dinner with their soup IV hanging on the hook there, you know?
How's yours, Grandpa?
Oh, chunky style.
What theatre do you wanna go to tonight?
We got 61 st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Which one you wanna go to, Schmoopie?
You called me "Schmoopie." You're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.
You're Schmoopie.
All right, Schmoopies, what's it gonna be?
- Pick a theatre.
- We'll go to 3rd Avenue.
So can you come with us to the soup place?
No, you have a good lunch.
I'll meet you here for the movie.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hi, Sheila.
All right, then I'll see you later.
- Bye, Schmoopie.
- Bye, Schmoopie.
Okay, we ready to go?
Yes, please.
Please, let's go.
I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
- No, we gotta go to the soup place.
- What soup place?
There's a soup stand.
Kramer's been going there.
He's always raving.
I finally got a chance to go, and I tell you this:
You will be stunned.
Stunned by soup?
You can't eat this soup standing up.
Your knees buckle.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
There's only one caveat.
Guy who runs the place is a little temperamental.
Especially about the ordering procedure.
He's secretly referred to as the "Soup Nazi."
What happens if you don't order right?
- He yells, and you don't get your soup.
- What?
Just follow the procedure and you will be fine.
- All right, let's go over that again.
- All right.
As you walk in the place, move immediately to your right.
Okay, the main thing is to keep the line moving.
You hold out your money, speak your soup in a clear voice step to the left, and receive soup.
- Right.
It's very important not to embellish your order.
No extraneous comments, no questions, no compliments.
- Oh, boy, I'm really scared.
- Elaine.
Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi.
Look at this.
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.
It's French, armoire.
Armoire.
- How much is this?
- I was asking 250.
But you got a nice face.
Two even.
Two hundred.
You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
- He gave you the nice-face discount.
- Yeah.
All right, you guys go ahead.
- What about the soup?
- I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
Pardon.
This line is huge.
And it's like this all the time.
Isn't that that Bania guy?
Oh, no.
It is.
Just be still.
Too late.
I think he picked up the scent.
Hey, Jerry, I didn't know you liked soup.
Hard to believe.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry.
The best.
You know what they call him?
"Soup Nazi."
All right, Bania.
- I'm not letting you cut in line.
- Why not?
If he catches us, we'll never get soup again.
Okay, okay.
Medium turkey chili.
Medium crab bisque.
- I didn't get any bread.
- Just forget it.
Let it go.
Excuse me.
I think you forgot my bread.
Bread, $2.00 extra.
Two dollars?
But everyone in front of me got free bread.
- You want bread?
- Yes, please.
Three dollars!
- What?
- No soup for you!
What do you mean, I can't bring it in?
I live here.
It's Sunday.
There's no moving on Sunday.
- That's the rule.
- But I didn't know, Tom.
Can't you just make an exception?
Please?
I've got a nice face.
Tomorrow, okay?
You move it in tomorrow.
I'll even give you a hand.
- You're gonna have to hold it.
- I'm the guy on the sidewalk.
I don't have layaway.
Oh, no.
Please don't go.
Please.
Please don't walk away.
Oh, man.
Oh, this is fantastic.
How does he do it?
I don't see how you can sit there eating, and not even offer me any?
I gave you a taste.
What do you want?
- Why can't we share?
- I told you not to say anything.
You can't go in there, flout the rules, and then think I'm gonna share.
- Do you hear you yourself?
- I'm sorry.
This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Well, I gotta go back there and try again.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Schmoopie.
- Hi, Schmoopie.
- No, you're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.
- Going.
- Hey, listen so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I don't think so.
- Why?
- I just don't feel like it anymore.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
Elaine has to leave her armoire on the street all night.
I'm gonna guard it for her.
I need something to sit on.
Well, sit on one of your cushions.
But this is so nice and thick.
Ahoy, there.
Oh, Kramer, thank God.
- I really appreciate your doing this.
- Well, you asked for it, you got it.
Do you need anything?
Well, a hot bowl of mulagatani would hit the spot.
- Mulagatani?
- Yeah, it's an Indian soup.
Simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Who, the Soup Nazi?
He's not a Nazi.
He just happens to be a little eccentric.
You know, most geniuses are.
- I'll be back.
- Wait a second.
- You don't know how to order.
- No, I got it.
- No, Elaine.
- Hey, I got it.
Hey, didn't you already get soup?
No, I didn't get it.
Why?
What happened?
I made a mistake.
Well, we'll see what happens to you.
Yeah, no, listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Let me ask you something.
Is it just me or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
Oh, I know.
It's awful.
Why do they do that in front of people?
- I don't know.
- What is that with the Schmoopie?
- Schmoopie.
- Oh, stop it.
I know.
I had to listen to a discussion on which one is actually called Schmoopie.
I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them.
- You know, we should say something.
- We absolutely should.
I mean, why does he do that?
Doesn't he know what a turnoff that is?
- He can be so weird sometimes.
- Yes.
- I haven't figured him out.
- Me neither.
I gotta focus.
I'm shifting into soup mode.
Oh, God.
Good afternoon.
One large crab bisque to go.
Bread.
Beautiful.
You're pushing your luck, little man.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, there.
Oh, one mulagatani, and...
What is that there?
Is that lima bean?
- Yes.
- Never been a big fan.
You know what?
Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino?
You know, Scent of a Woman.
Very good.
Very good.
You know something?
No soup for you!
- What?
- Come back, one year!
Next!
- Look at this.
- It's an antique.
It's all handmade, and I love the inlay.
Yes, yes.
Me too.
It's gorgeous, completely.
Pick it up.
- Pick it up from the bottom.
- Wait, what are you doing?
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.
Look, you wanna get hurt?
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.
Now, just back off.
- Bob.
- Just pick it up.
Hey, what is this, huh?
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?
We're taking the armoire, and that's all there is to it.
Okay?
I mean, is he allowed to do this?
It's discrimination.
I'm gonna call the state's attorney's office.
This is fabulous, my God.
Elaine, you have to taste this.
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.
- Oh, my God.
I've gotta sit down.
- Yeah.
What happened?
Where's my armoire?
- It was stolen.
- What?
These street toughs, they robbed me.
Street toughs took my armoire?
Yeah, it was very frightening.
My life was in danger.
You should've seen the way they talked to me.
- I can't believe this!
- So where's the soup?
The Soup Nazi threw me out.
Yeah!
- What are you gonna get?
- I'll decide at the last minute.
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.
Sheila!
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?
Nobody kisses in my line.
- I can kiss anywhere I want to.
- You just cost yourself a soup.
How dare you?
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.
Jerry?
Do I know you?
So essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
It was a bisque.
Yeah, you know what I've just realized?
Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, I mean, think about it.
He's engaged to be married.
Your top priority is soup.
Have you tasted the soup?
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.
See, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh, thanks.
- There he is.
Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
Yeah, I know.
Me too.
- So did these thieves want any money?
- No.
- They just wanted the armoire?
- Yeah, they were quite taken with it.
Yeah.
Have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
No.
In what way?
I don't know.
A lot of attitude, like he's better than me.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?
Absolutely not.
- Something's going on here.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get some soup.
One of these days, that guy is gonna get his.
So how was the movie?
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
What, are you happy?
- Happy?
Why should I be happy?
- I don't know.
But you look like you're happy.
Why should I care?
You can't fool me.
Don't insult me, because I know when you're happy.
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.
The two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick.
Right, Elaine?
Is that so?
Yeah.
With all that kissing and the "Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."
- Out in public like that.
It's disgusting.
- Disgusting?
People who do that should be arrested.
I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
And we had a pact, you know.
- What?
- You shook my hand.
You're still with the pact?
- You reneged.
- All I did was shake your hand.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
This city.
One large jambalaya, please.
- So continue.
- My friend is awfully disappointed.
You know, she's very emotional.
Thank you.
Jambalaya.
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.
I have an armoire in my basement.
If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it.
So take it, it's yours.
How can I possibly thank you?
You are the only one who understands me.
- You suffer for your soup.
- Yes, that is right.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
How can I tolerate any less from my customers?
Gazpacho, por fav or.
- "Por fav or"?
- Oh, I'm part Spanish.
Adios, muchacho.
You heard him.
Get out.
It was stupid of me.
Well, it was very insulting.
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.
Well, behind every joke there's some truth.
Well, what about that Bavarian cream pie joke?
There's no truth to that.
Nobody with a terminal illness goes to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they don't have it, he says, "I'll just have some coffee."
- There's no truth to that.
- Well, I guess you're right.
- So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
- Yes, Schmoopie.
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Susan.
George.
You remember Sheila.
- Oh, yes.
Hello.
- Hello.
Won't you join us?
- No, thanks.
Yes.
- Of course.
So you sit on the same side in a booth?
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?
I just think it's a little unusual for two people to sit on one side and leave the other side empty.
Well, we're changing the rules.
Well, good for you.
What are you getting, George?
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?
I want you to get anything you want.
Because I love you so much, and I want you to be happy.
Okay, sweetie?
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
Well, I can be a little sweetie-tweetie-wheetie-wheetie.
What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?
- You want a little tuna fishy?
- Yeah, a little tuna fishy.
Fishy.
Come here.
And voilà!
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love it!
I absolutely love it!
Yeah, did the K-Man do it or did the K-Man do it?
- The K-man did it!
- Yeah!
- How much did you pay for this?
- How about zero?
What?
What?
Whose was it?
Where'd you get it?
I'll tell you where I got it.
From the guy you callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Get out!
The Soap Nazi gave it to you?
Why?
Well, I told him the whole story, and he just let me have it.
Yeah, he's a wonderful man.
Yeah, you know, a little bit misunderstood, but...
I'm gonna go down there and personally thank him.
I mean, I had this guy all wrong.
This is wonderful.
Yeah, well, he's a dear.
How much tip do you leave on 8.15?
You know, sweetie I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all.
Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things it's such a great step forward in our relationship.
Because you love your little Kiki, don't you?
- How is he today?
- I think he's in a good mood.
Hi.
Kramer gave me the armoire, and it is so beautiful.
I mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
You?
If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him!
I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces.
Now, who wants soup?
Next, speak up.
I'm headed over to Elaine's.
Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
- Those two?
Are you sure?
- That's them.
- Let's confront them.
- No, let's get a cop.
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.
Come on, let's go.
Wow, look, that one is gorgeous.
I would just kill for that one.
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.
Do you know what you're talking about?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Take a look at that.
Excuse me.
- Are you talking to me?
- Well...
I said, are you talking to me?
Well, maybe he was talking to me.
Was you talking to him?
Because you was obviously talking to one of us.
So what is it?
Who?
Who was you talking to?
We were kind of talking to each other.
Weren't we?
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.
There's something really wrong with this man.
He is a Soup Nazi.
- What?
What is that?
- I don't know.
"Five cups chopped porcini mushroom half a cup of olive oil, three pounds of celery chopped parsley..."
- Let me see.
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.
Look at this.
There are like 30 different recipes.
These are his recipes.
- So?
- So?
His secret's out.
Don't you see?
I could give these to every restaurant in town.
I could have them published.
I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Wait, where do you think you're going?
What do you care?
I don't want you causing trouble down at that soup stand.
I love that soup.
- Get out of my way, Jerry.
- Elaine, let the man make his soup.
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
Look, they have it in blue.
For my baby bluey.
- Are you my baby bluey?
- Oh, yes, I'm your baby bluey.
Oh, yes.
Well, well.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey, Susan, George.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Oh, really?
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
Oh, no, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, she was very affectionate, which I love.
You know I love that.
But mentally we couldn't quite make a connection.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Too bad.
You gotta have the affection, which you obviously have.
I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public.
See, we had that.
- You did?
- Oh, yes.
But the mental thing...
But, anyway...
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.
See you.
Go on, leave.
Get out!
- But I didn't do anything.
- Next.
Hello.
You?
You think you can get soup?
Please, you're wasting everyone's time.
I don't want soup.
I can make my own soup.
"Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms half a cup of olive oil three pounds celery."
That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
Yeah, that's right.
I got them all.
Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder.
- Mulagatani.
- Mulagatani?
You're through, Soup Nazi.
Pack it up.
No more soup for you.
Next!
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!
- What is it?
- Something happened to Soup Nazi.
- What is the matter?
- Elaine's causing a commotion.
She got ahold of his recipes, and she's gonna drive him out of business.
Now that his recipes are out he's not gonna make any more soup!
He's moving out of the country!
Moving to Argentina!
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!
- Where you going?
- He's giving away what's left.
I gotta go home and get a big pot.
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.
That's why I like soup.
First of all, it looks half-digested so you feel like half the work is done already.
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out with an iv line of soup that you could just jam right into your arm, you know?
Campbell's tomato intravenous.
Mainline gumbo.
Everyone just sitting around at dinner with their soup iv hanging on the hook there, you know?
How's yours, Grandpa?
Oh, chunky style.
What theatre do you wanna go to tonight?
We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Which one you wanna go to, Schmoopie?
You called me "Schmoopie." You're Schmoopie.
-You're Schmoopie.
-You're Schmoopie.
You're Schmoopie.
All right, Schmoopies, what's it gonna be?
-Pick a theatre.
-We'll go to 3rd Avenue.
So can you come with us to the soup place?
No, you have a good lunch.
I'll meet you here for the movie.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi, Sheila.
All right, then I'll see you later.
-Bye, Schmoopie.
-Bye, Schmoopie.
Okay, we ready to go?
Yes, please.
Please, let's go.
I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
-No, we gotta go to the soup place.
-What soup place?
There's a soup stand.
Kramer's been going there.
He's always raving.
I finally got a chance to go, and I tell you this;
You will be stunned.
Stunned by soup?
You can't eat this soup standing up.
Your knees buckle.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
There's only one caveat.
Guy who runs the place is a little temperamental.
Especially about the ordering procedure.
He's secretly referred to as the "Soup Nazi."
What happens if you don't order right?
-He yells, and you don't get your soup.
-What?
Just follow the procedure and you will be fine.
-All right, let's go over that again.
-All right.
As you walk in the place, move immediately to your right.
Okay, the main thing is to keep the line moving.
You hold out your money, speak your soup in a clear voice...
-...step to the left, and receive soup.
-Right.
It's very important not to embellish your order.
No extraneous comments, no questions, no compliments.
-Oh, boy, I'm really scared.
-Elaine.
Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi.
Look at this.
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.
It's French, armoire.
Armoire.
-How much is this?
-I was asking 250.
But you got a nice face.
Two even.
Two hundred.
You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
-He gave you the nice-face discount.
-Yeah.
All right, you guys go ahead.
-What about the soup?
-I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
Pardon.
This line is huge.
And it's like this all the time.
Isn't that that Bania guy?
Oh, no.
It is.
Just be still.
Too late.
I think he picked up the scent.
Hey, Jerry, I didn't know you liked soup.
Hard to believe.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry.
The best.
You know what they call him?
"Soup Nazi."
All right, Bania.
-I'm not letting you cut in line.
-Why not?
If he catches us, we'll never get soup again.
Okay, okay.
Medium turkey chili.
Medium crab bisque.
-I didn't get any bread.
-Just forget it.
Let it go.
Excuse me.
I think you forgot my bread.
Bread, $2.00 extra.
Two dollars?
But everyone in front of me got free bread.
-You want bread?
-Yes, please.
Three dollars!
-What?
-No soup for you!
What do you mean, I can't bring it in?
I live here.
It's Sunday.
There's no moving on Sunday.
-That's the rule.
-But I didn't know, Tom.
Can't you just make an exception?
Please?
I've got a nice face.
Tomorrow, okay?
You move it in tomorrow.
I'll even give you a hand.
-You're gonna have to hold it.
-I'm the guy on the sidewalk.
I don't have layaway.
Oh, no.
Please don't go.
Please.
Please don't walk away.
Oh, man.
Oh, this is fantastic.
How does he do it?
I don't see how you can sit there eating, and not even offer me any?
I gave you a taste.
What do you want?
-Why can't we share?
-I told you not to say anything.
You can't go in there, flout the rules, and then think I'm gonna share.
-Do you hear you yourself?
-I'm sorry.
This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
Well, I gotta go back there and try again.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi, Schmoopie.
-Hi, Schmoopie.
-No, you're Schmoopie.
-You're Schmoopie.
-Going.
-Hey, listen so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I don't think so.
-Why?
-I just don't feel like it anymore.
-Just like that?
-Just like that.
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?
-Hey.
-Hey.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
Elaine has to leave her armoire on the street all night.
I'm gonna guard it for her.
I need something to sit on.
Well, sit on one of your cushions.
But this is so nice and thick.
Ahoy, there.
Oh, Kramer, thank God.
-I really appreciate your doing this.
-Well, you asked for it, you got it.
Do you need anything?
Well, a hot bowl of mulagatani would hit the spot.
-Mulagatani?
-Yeah, it's an Indian soup.
Simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Who, the Soup Nazi?
He's not a Nazi.
He just happens to be a little eccentric.
You know, most geniuses are.
-I'll be back.
-Wait a second.
-You don't know how to order.
-No, I got it.
-No, Elaine.
-Hey, I got it.
Hey, didn't you already get soup?
No, I didn't get it.
Why?
What happened?
I made a mistake.
Well, we'll see what happens to you.
Yeah, no, listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Let me ask you something.
Is it just me or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
Oh, I know.
It's awful.
Why do they do that in front of people?
-I don't know.
-What is that with the Schmoopie?
-Schmoopie.
-Oh, stop it.
I know.
I had to listen to a discussion on which one is actually called Schmoopie.
I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them.
-You know, we should say something.
-We absolutely should.
I mean, why does he do that?
Doesn't he know what a turnoff that is?
-He can be so weird sometimes.
-Yes.
-I haven't figured him out.
-Me neither.
I gotta focus.
I'm shifting into soup mode.
Oh, God.
Good afternoon.
One large crab bisque to go.
Bread.
Beautiful.
You're pushing your luck, little man.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, there.
Oh, one mulagatani, and....
What is that there?
Is that lima bean?
-Yes.
-Never been a big fan.
You know what?
Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino?
You know, Scent of a Woman.
Very good.
Very good.
You know something?
No soup for you!
-What?
-Come back, one year!
Next!
-Look at this.
-It's an antique.
It's all handmade, and I love the inlay.
Yes, yes.
Me too.
It's gorgeous, completely.
Pick it up.
-Pick it up from the bottom.
-Wait, what are you doing?
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.
Look, you wanna get hurt?
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.
Now, just back off.
-Bob.
-Just pick it up.
Hey, what is this, huh?
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?
We're taking the armoire, and that's all there is to it.
Okay?
I mean, is he allowed to do this?
It's discrimination.
I'm gonna call the state's attorney's office.
This is fabulous, my God.
Elaine, you have to taste this.
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.
-Oh, my God.
I've gotta sit down.
-Yeah.
What happened?
Where's my armoire?
-lt was stolen.
-What?
These street toughs, they robbed me.
Street toughs took my armoire?
Yeah, it was very frightening.
My life was in danger.
You should've seen the way they talked to me.
-I can't believe this!
-So where's the soup?
The Soup Nazi threw me out.
Yeah!
-What are you gonna get?
-I'll decide at the last minute.
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.
Sheila!
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?
Nobody kisses in my line.
-I can kiss anywhere I want to.
-You just cost yourself a soup.
How dare you?
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.
Jerry?
Do I know you?
So essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
It was a bisque.
Yeah, you know what I've just realized?
Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Well, I mean, think about it.
He's engaged to be married.
Your top priority is soup.
Have you tasted the soup?
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.
See, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Oh, thanks.
-There he is.
Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
Yeah, I know.
Me too.
-So did these thieves want any money?
-No.
-They just wanted the armoire?
-Yeah, they were quite taken with it.
Yeah.
Have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
No.
In what way?
I don't know.
A lot of attitude, like he's better than me.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?
Absolutely not.
-Something's going on here.
-All right.
I'm gonna go get some soup.
One of these days, that guy is gonna get his.
So how was the movie?
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
What, are you happy?
-Happy?
Why should I be happy?
-I don't know.
But you look like you're happy.
Why should I care?
You can't fool me.
Don't insult me, because I know when you're happy.
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.
The two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick.
Right, Elaine?
Is that so?
Yeah.
With all that kissing and the "Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."
-Out in public like that.
It's disgusting.
-Disgusting?
People who do that should be arrested.
I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
And we had a pact, you know.
-What?
-You shook my hand.
You're still with the pact?
-You reneged.
-All I did was shake your hand.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
This city.
One large jambalaya, please.
-So continue.
-My friend is awfully disappointed.
You know, she's very emotional.
Thank you.
Jambalaya.
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.
I have an armoire in my basement.
If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it.
So take it, it's yours.
How can I possibly thank you?
You are the only one who understands me.
-You suffer for your soup.
-Yes, that is right.
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
How can I tolerate any less from my customers?
Gazpacho, por favor.
-"Por favor"?
-Oh, I'm part Spanish.
Adios, muchacho.
You heard him.
Get out.
It was stupid of me.
Well, it was very insulting.
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.
Well, behind every joke there's some truth.
Well, what about that Bavarian cream pie joke?
There's no truth to that.
Nobody with a terminal illness goes to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they don't have it, he says, "I'll just have some coffee."
-There's no truth to that.
-Well, I guess you're right.
-So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
-Yes, Schmoopie.
-Hey, Jerry.
-Oh, hi, Susan.
George.
You remember Sheila.
-Oh, yes.
Hello.
-Hello.
Won't you join us?
-No, thanks.
Yes.
-Of course.
So you sit on the same side in a booth?
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?
I just think it's a little unusual for two people to sit on one side and leave the other side empty.
Well, we're changing the rules.
Well, good for you.
What are you getting, George?
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?
I want you to get anything you want.
Because I love you so much, and I want you to be happy.
Okay, sweetie?
Oh, George, you're so sweet.
Well, I can be a little sweetie-tweetie-wheetie-wheetie.
What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?
-You want a little tuna fishy?
-Yeah, a little tuna fishy.
Fishy.
Come here.
And voilà!
-Yeah.
-Oh, I love it!
I absolutely love it!
Yeah, did the K-Man do it or did the K-Man do it?
-The K-man did it!
-Yeah!
-How much did you pay for this?
-How about zero?
What?
What?
Whose was it?
Where'd you get it?
I'll tell you where I got it.
From the guy you callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
Get out!
The Soap Nazi gave it to you?
Why?
Well, I told him the whole story, and he just let me have it.
Yeah, he's a wonderful man.
Yeah, you know, a little bit misunderstood, but....
I'm gonna go down there and personally thank him.
I mean, I had this guy all wrong.
This is wonderful.
Yeah, well, he's a dear.
How much tip do you leave on 8.15?
You know, sweetie I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all.
Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things it's such a great step forward in our relationship.
Because you love your little Kiki, don't you?
-How is he today?
-I think he's in a good mood.
Hi.
Kramer gave me the armoire, and it is so beautiful.
I mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
You?
If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him!
I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces.
Now, who wants soup?
Next, speak up.
I'm headed over to Elaine's.
Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
-Those two?
Are you sure?
-That's them.
-Let's confront them.
-No, let's get a cop.
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.
Come on, let's go.
Wow, look, that one is gorgeous.
I would just kill for that one.
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.
Do you know what you're talking about?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Take a look at that.
Excuse me.
-Are you talking to me?
-Well....
I said, are you talking to me?
Well, maybe he was talking to me.
Was you talking to him?
Because you was obviously talking to one of us.
So what is it?
Who?
Who was you talking to?
We were kind of talking to each other.
Weren't we?
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.
There's something really wrong with this man.
He is a Soup Nazi.
-What?
What is that?
-I don't know.
"Five cups chopped porcini mushroom half a cup of olive oil, three pounds of celery...
-...chopped parsley--"
-Let me see.
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.
Look at this.
There are like 30 different recipes.
These are his recipes.
-So?
-So?
His secret's out.
Don't you see?
I could give these to every restaurant in town.
I could have them published.
I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Wait, where do you think you're going?
What do you care?
I don't want you causing trouble down at that soup stand.
I love that soup.
-Get out of my way, Jerry.
-Elaine, let the man make his soup.
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
Look, they have it in blue.
For my baby bluey.
-Are you my baby bluey?
-Oh, yes, I'm your baby bluey.
Oh, yes.
Well, well.
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hey, Susan, George.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Oh, really?
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
Oh, no, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, she was very affectionate, which I love.
You know I love that.
But mentally we couldn't quite make a connection.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Too bad.
You gotta have the affection, which you obviously have.
I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public.
See, we had that.
-You did?
-Oh, yes.
But the mental thing....
But, anyway....
-I'll see you.
-Yeah.
See you.
Go on, leave.
Get out!
-But I didn't do anything.
-Next.
Hello.
You?
You think you can get soup?
Please, you're wasting everyone's time.
I don't want soup.
I can make my own soup.
"Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms half a cup of olive oil three pounds celery."
That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
Yeah, that's right.
I got them all.
Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder.
-Mulagatani.
-Mulagatani?
You're through, Soup Nazi.
Pack it up.
No more soup for you.
Next!
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!
-What is it?
-Something happened to Soup Nazi.
-What is the matter?
-Elaine's causing a commotion.
She got ahold of his recipes, and she's gonna drive him out of business.
Now that his recipes are out he's not gonna make any more soup!
He's moving out of the country!
Moving to Argentina!
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!
-Where you going?
-He's giving away what's left.
I gotta go home and get a big pot.
Did you look in the closet?
Well, Daddy, look in the closet.
Again?
Because that's where Mom's kept the towels for the past 40 years.
He shoots.
Yes.
How do you know I didn't make it?
Okay.
You got it?
Yes, I am that's why you sent me to college.
Okay, Daddy, good night.
God, he's so helpless.
Where did your mother go anyway?
She's spending the weekend with Uncle Phil.
For what?
His wife's in Albany, so he's all alone.
What's in Albany.
Her brother.
Where's his wife?
In diet camp till Monday.
So basically, because of one fat woman upstate New York, 17 families go out of wack?
That's about it.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Yeah, I wonder who that is?
Hi, Daddy.
No, no, you like French's mustard not French mustard.
Ow!
No.
The Poupon is French, and the French's is actually American.
I said "Ow".
What?
Okay.
Tell me you don't feel this spring.
Sourdough.
This is a huge spring.
This whole bed is just shot.
Actually, why don't I hold on while you toast it?
We're not getting a new bed.
Seriously, we've had this bed since we moved in together.
No.
Why?
Because we've had it since we moved in together.
You know, on 60 Minutes, I saw a thing.
A Malaysian child was sleeping on a mattress just like this.
Mike Wallace cried.
Little tears, little tears coming out.
Fine.
I will think about it.
No.
No.
That's good.
The toast is supposed to be brown.
Go get a tomato.
You know, why don't you just invite your father down for the weekend?
I already did.
He doesn't like to leave the house.
Maybe we should go there.
Then I'd have to leave the house.
Oh, God, no, no, no.
Then forget the tomato.
Go get the mayonnaise.
Well, maybe you should go.
What?
And leave you home alone?
What am I, Macaulay Culkin?
All right.
Try counterclockwise.
Just...
Just go before he hurts himself.
Daddy, maybe I should just come and stay with you till Mom gets back.
You sure you'll be fine?
I'll be fine.
Are you sure?
I'll be thrilled.
You'll be thrilled?
All righty.
So, um...
So I'll be there tomorrow.
First train in the morning.
Okay.
Good night.
Not--Not thrilled, happy-thrilled, thrilled when you get back because I will have missed you the whole weekend, so great is my love for you.
Okay.
The shower's dripping, so you have to call Mr. Wicker before it explodes again.
I understand.
And don't forget, you need to light the oven.
If you need extra light bulbs, they're in the thing.
If the refrigerator starts humming...
Then I'll harmonize with it.
Are you gonna be okay?
I'll be fine.
What are you gonna do?
I'll do-
- I'll do whatever.
I'll c-call the guys.
What guys?
The guys.
You don't have any guys.
I've got guys.
I've got plenty of guys.
Okay.
If you decide to do laundry...
I'm not gonna do laundry.
Yeah, but if you do...
I'm not gonna do laundry.
...don't do it between 4:00 and 6:00, or you'll run into the Kopecks and their kids and just trust me.
Yeah.
Understand how much I'm not gonna do laundry.
(INTERCOM BUZZING) All right.
MR. WICKER:
Cab's here.
She's coming.
Come on, sweetie, you're upsetting the cabbie.
You know, you're allergic to coconut.
So, no luaus.
Are you gonna miss me at all?
Yes, only if you leave.
Bye.
Bye.
Have fun.
Well, now, it's all mine!
It's all mine.
That's mine.
It's all mine.
That was always mine, now it's even more mine.
Anything in here?
All mine.
Milk.
Perfect example of things that are mine.
Mmm.
Ah.
See that?
Virtually empty, yet I put it right back.
Whatever you want.
Mallomars.
By the way, I don't know if I mentioned, Mallomars, also mine.
You can have one, too.
You see that?
I don't even close it.
That's how giddy I am with power.
Come dog of mine.
Come with me.
Let's watch my Baywatch.
You can sit.
Sit, lick, whatever you want.
All right.
Here we go.
There's a 3:20, 5:30, there's 7:45...
Paulie, I can't go to the movies.
Why not?
I've got a date.
What?
Yeah, we do that out here.
But I'm free.
Imagine my dilemma.
(SCOFFS)
All right.
Fine.
You know what?
I'll call the guys.
What guys?
I've got guys.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I understand.
It's softwood walking.
I'm gonna go bowling.
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.
You want to borrow some of my guys?
Why would I want your guys?
Because you don't do alone so good.
Hey, excuse me.
I lived alone for 30 years.
Paulie, you lived with your parents until you were 18.
In college you had roommates.
We lived together until I threw you out, and then Jamie.
Basically, you've been alone about five minutes your whole life.
You didn't throw me out.
Hey, I don't want to have that discussion again.
What?
You want me to call Susannah and cancel my date?
Nah.
Because I would.
You would?
Yeah, I would.
All right.
(LAUGHING) I'm not gonna cancel my date.
(MURRAY BARKING)
Hey, dog of mine.
Pepperoni.
Do not tell your mother.
Oh, is the shower exploding again?
I forgot to call Wicker.
That's what I need this weekend, a flood.
(FRAN SCREAMING)
(PAUL EXCLAIMING)
Hi.
Hey, Fran.
Hi.
When did you get here?
(SIGHS) Sorry I screamed.
You startled me.
Oh, were those yours?
What?
(STAMMERING) No, 'cause I didn't see a thing.
Okay.
I swear.
Fine.
I'm gonna go get dressed.
Okay.
Please do that.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Hi, sweetie.
How was your trip?
It was okay.
The train was a little late.
All right, good.
Listen.
Um. hypothetical situation.
Fran is naked in our house.
Why would that be?
She must have gone to the gym.
So?
The shower there is all nasty.
The gym's right around the corner, so she comes over to us.
Like, all the time?
Yeah, you know.
No.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's the whole point.
What happened?
Are you okay?
No.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's the whole point.
What happened?
No.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's the whole point.
What happened?
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm just...
Everything is under control.
No.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's the whole point.
What happened?
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm just...
Everything is under control.
I didn't see a thing.
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm just...
Everything is under control.
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm just...
Everything is under control.
(DOORBELL BUZZING) All right.
Bye-bye.
Why didn't you say something?
(WHIMPERS)
Snappy Garments.
And a lovely jacket yourself.
I'm here to pick up your dry cleaning.
No.
What?
Buchman?
Yeah.
11 D?
Yeah.
One second.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
PAUL:
Hi, it's me.
Um, there's a guy here, wants our clothing.
Do we do that, or are we being robbed?
We do that.
Since when?
It's free.
What else goes on around here?
It's the blue bag in the closet.
I'm quite aware of the blue bag.
You sure you're gonna be okay?
I'll be fine.
Everything is under control.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Sorry about that.
It's just...
My wife is away, so you know how that is.
I've got to do everything myself.
Are these dry clean or laundry?
What's that?
Dry clean or laundry?
Hey, you know what?
I've got no guys.
Not a guy to be found here.
Hi, it's me.
Dry clean.
Not a guy to be found here.
Hi, it's me.
Dry clean.
Thank you.
Zucker?
Nah.
That's all right.
That's all right.
You know what?
It's good to be alone.
It's good for the soul.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
Thank God.
I'm coming.
Don't go away.
Don't go away.
Right here.
Please don't go.
Lisa.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, how are you?
Uh, I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd bring you some lunch.
Did Jamie say to do that?
No.
Did she tell you to say no?
Yes.
I'm borrowing a dress.
Anything.
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
Sure.
You got a big date tonight?
Oh, just Troy, you know.
Going out with Troy.
Mmm-hmm.
Which one is Troy?
Harriette's acupuncturist.
He's an acupuncturist.
So he works with needles?
I would think that's fascinating work.
What is wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong with me.
I was just thinking.
You and I never get to really talk.
Oh, we talk.
No, not really.
Well, Jamie and I talk, you sit there and roll your eyes.
I don't roll my eyes at you.
Yeah, right.
Never.
Where--where did you get that?
Oh, come on.
You couldn't talk to me two minutes and not roll your eyes.
Oh, that's so not true.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm thinking of buying a ferret.
Good for you.
Mmm-hmm.
I know where I can get one for $600.
Sounds pricey for a weasel, but...
Well, you know how good I am at budgeting my money.
Nobody better.
I figured I name him Biff after this old boyfriend of mine who used to be a doorman at FAO Schwarz, only he got fired for stealing Legos and had to move back home to Jersey, which was kind of a drag because we had bought this '63 Valiant together,
and whenever I felt like driving uptown, I had to go to Newark first.
But, actually, it worked out pretty well because the bus I had to take had this driver named Delana, and she let me honk the horn once in a while, and eventually she introduced me to her brother who breeds ferrets,
and he said I could have pick of the litter for $600 and a pair of my panties, which you can't deny is a pretty good deal.
(DOORBELL BUZZING) Sounds great.
Excuse me for a second.
Hi.
Buchman?
Yes.
Sign here.
What, a Meat of the Month Club?
That's right.
I don't think so.
Ah, just--just one second.
My wife is out of town, so it's all been...
Just... (PHONE RINGING)
JAMIE:
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
Well, blow me down.
There's a guy here with a box of meat.
So?
So?
So?
I'm saying to you.
What?
Since when do we eat meat in a box?
Three years.
Really?
And I enjoy it?
Yeah.
You love it.
Well, who knew?
Is that Jamie?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I didn't borrow her new dress.
Hey, come on, get back here.
Honey, are you sure you're okay?
Huh?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just, uh, a lot of surprises for one day.
Do you want me to come home?
No, no, no.
Hey, everything is under control.
All righty.
I'll talk to you in five minutes.
That's very funny.
Yeah, who's next?
Who is that?
Nobody.
Nobody.
I have things under control.
I'll be on the 4:00 train.
Bye-bye.
All right.
Love you, babe.
Little Sisters of Mercy.
You bet.
We're from the thrift store.
I know.
You picking up or you dropping off?
We're here to pick up the bed.
The bed?
I understand.
Of course.
Why?
Your wife donated it.
She did?
That's what it says.
Uh, all right.
Yeah, okay.
Uh, of course, it's right through there.
Right there in the bedroom.
'Cause we...
We've been having a little problem with the bed, so we've been talking about getting a new one.
Uh, so, I guess why my wife called you and just said, uh...
The whole bed?
That's what it says.
Uh, uh, just--just one second, would ya?
'Cause I don't...
Take the bed out of here.
When is your wife coming back?
Why do you ask?
Hey, Conways.
You need a taxi, right?
If you would.
Hey, hey, look at you two.
You're looking pretty sporty.
You've got a big day?
Brunch and the opera with my publisher.
Oh, my wife and I used go to brunch all the time.
Oh, have you two split up?
No, no.
She just...
Is she dead?
No, she's not dead.
She's out of the town.
BOTH:
Oh.
MR. WICKER:
Cab's ready.
Oh, Mr. Wicker, you didn't happen to see any delivery men yesterday, did you?
For you?
Yes.
We donated some furniture to charity, but they never showed up.
Gee, I was only on in the morning.
Never mind.
We'll call them tomorrow.
Come on, darling.
If you're done with this book review I'm gonna...
What did they say about picking up furniture?
(IRA LAUGHING)
Laughter is not constructive.
No, no, let me get this straight.
Two guys come down your hall with a clipboard and you think, "Let me give you my bed."
Yes.
How do you do that?
Because I am the dumbest man in the country.
And yet, and yet, maybe I'm not.
Maybe Jamie was in a charitable mood.
So why don't you give her a call and ask her?
I can't.
I can't call her because then she'll know...
How stupid you are?
Yes.
She's gonna be home tonight.
Maybe she won't notice.
I don't know, Paulie, she's pretty sharp.
All right.
It really does open up the room, though, doesn't it?
Shut up.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Hey, top of the morning to you.
What's wrong?
Nothing is wrong.
I just wanted see how you are doing.
Well, that's sweet.
I'm good.
I miss you.
Okay.
Listen.
Um...
I was just wondering, did you give any more thought to the buying a new bed thing we discussed?
No.
I haven't.
Okay.
Bye.
So of all the men in America...
I am the most stupid.
Okay.
How do I fix this?
What's the name of the charity?
The name of the charity.
Oh, they said...
The guy said it.
He said it.
He's standing there.
Big guy, big guy.
He said, "Hi, we're here from..."
"We're here from..." Something, something.
I didn't listen.
What about the Brits?
They weren't even here?
Yeah, but they would know the name.
The Brits would know the name, yes, because they're the ones who called 'em.
This is what I'm saying.
Oh, yeah, all right.
Good.
Hey, you know, this could happen to anybody.
It really couldn't.
(OPERA SINGER SINGING)
Conway.
There you are.
The charity donation thing, it wasn't a bed by any chance, was it?
MAN:
What's going on?
We don't know them.
Because they picked up our bed.
We've never seen them before in our lives.
Hey, good seats.
(PEOPLE SHUSHING) Would you please go away?
Sorry, sorry.
Um, was it-- was it Unicef?
Was it...
Do you remember?
Was it Unicef?
Just nod.
Nod if it was Unicef.
It wasn't Unicef.
Uh, Goodwill?
Salvation Army?
A.S.P.C.A?
The Kidney Foundation?
(SINGING STOPS) It was the Little Sisters of Mercy!
All right?
The Little Sisters of Mercy!
Yes, thank you.
Come on.
I'm looking for a bed...
Well, we have a wide selection.
Please, do go on.
I'm looking for a bed...
Well, we have a wide selection.
Please, do go on.
...a very specific bed.
Please, do go on.
...a very specific bed.
(OPERA SINGER RESUMES SINGING) ...a very specific bed.
(OPERA SINGER RESUMES SINGING)
Wood with the little iron stuff.
(OPERA SINGER RESUMES SINGING)
(OPERA SINGER RESUMES SINGING)
As a matter of fact, one like that arrived just yesterday.
That's my bed.
(OPERA SINGER RESUMES SINGING)
As a matter of fact, one like that arrived just yesterday.
That's my bed.
I wish all my customers were as easy as you.
No, no, no.
I mean, It is-
- It is my bed.
I gave it to you.
And God bless.
It was a mistake.
Oh, giving is never a mistake.
Well, sometimes it is.
Uh. it actually is my bed.
I understand.
So could I just get it back?
Of course.
Thank you.
I believe we priced it at $400.
Hey, Sister, how much for the one with Nick and Doris?
It's for me.
No, but...
Excuse me.
It's my bed.
Not anymore.
No, you have a whole other bed.
It's coming from British people.
When?
When?
Whenever.
Well, I can't live on faith.
So now they want to charge me $400, and my wife is coming back in a few hours.
So, if I just bring them your bed, then everybody is happy, right?
I'd say you've gotten yourself a bit over a barrel, haven't you?
(MIMICKING BRITISH ACCENT) Hasn't he?
Yes, a little bit.
But now...
Darling, I've been thinking.
Perhaps, we've been a little bit rash.
(ELEVATOR DINGS) About what?
Well, our bed has been so good to us.
It seems almost rude to part with it.
Paul.
Yeah, one sec.
Okay, but you just said you already bought a new one.
I don't know.
Paul.
One sec.
So, just--just give me your bed.
All right.
Thank you.
For $300.
What?
Rather a bargain, I'd say.
Do you think we're under selling ourselves?
No, no, no, okay.
Fine.
Paul.
What?
Tell me if you notice anything.
FRAN:
If that bed scratches my roof, I'll kill you.
All right.
So now we're square, everything is even.
Hey, excuse me.
Hey, we were just about to buy this.
Sorry.
For how much?
It says $400.
Uh, wait.
That's...
It's my bed.
$410.
What are you doing?
Well, you want it or not?
I just bought a bed for you.
And God bless.
$420.
$430.
What?
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
You don't-- You don't need this bed, okay?
There's plenty of other beds.
Look at this nice Nick and Doris.
Hey, this would look cute on you.
Oh, it would.
Can I try it on?
Right in there.
Now where were we?
IRA: 450.
60.
Hey, what are you doing?
$500.
Stop it, okay?
It's okay.
It's too rich for me.
See?
Sold for $500.
Fine, fine, fine.
All right.
Now, can I show you something in an end table?
No.
Uh, j-just get the car.
Get the keys.
(FRAN SCREAMING) Fran, where's...
I didn't see anything.
I didn't see anything.
How did you get this thing together in the first place?
That was when I had guys.
Great.
I've got 14 things and 3 holes.
What do I do?
Join the circus.
Is this it?
No.
JAMIE:
Hello.
Oh, this is no good.
Now what?
Uh, all right.
How fast can you do this?
We can't.
All right, but hurry.
JAMIE:
Hello.
Hey.
Look who's home.
Hey.
Hi, what happened?
Aunt Rochelle got back early, so Mom got back early, so I took the 3:00 train.
It's like a whole little Darwinian thing there.
IRA:
Ow!
What was that?
How was your father?
Good?
Please.
The man fought two wars, he can't cut a melon.
I'm so exhausted.
Oh, you know what?
You're exhausted.
(STUTTERING) Let's go out.
What?
We'll take a walk, you know.
It'll pep you right up.
Now, honey, I just want to go to bed.
Well, okay, all right.
But first, I wanna show you something.
What?
Just come here.
Come here.
Come here, come here.
Honey.
I wanted you to see this.
This is good.
What?
Guess.
I'm-
- I'm really too tired to guess.
Oh, come on, come on.
Guess, guess, guess, guess.
Uh, you cleaned something?
No.
You cooked something?
Uh, no.
You ate something?
No.
All right.
I give up.
Oh, come on, come on.
Look.
Look--Look around.
Cold.
(CHUCKLES) Warm.
Warmer.
Cold.
Warm.
Warmer.
Hot.
Cold.
How can I be hot and cold at the same time?
Malaria.
No, wait.
All right, all right, all right.
You wanna dance?
No.
You wanna play cards?
No.
Wanna learn VCR Plus?
No.
If you had told me about the dry cleaning, or the meat, or at least one of 'em,
I would know what goes on around here.
So, basically, this is all your...
That was quick.
What?
Little shooting pain I just had.
It's all right.
Are you okay?
Um...
Yeah.
You know what, though?
I just missed you.
I really...
I missed you.
I love when you...
Nothing seems to work when you're not here.
Oh.
Really.
Well, now you're home and everything is good.
Welcome home.
Honey, maybe we should get a new bed.
This is all I'm saying.
(DOOR CREAKING)
(TRUNK CREAKING)
Lemon of Troy
"Wet cement."
Is there any sweeter sign?
Well, maybe "high voltage."
Hello, son.
You want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented?
- No time.
- Okay.
This is for the ages.
Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery.
Who was Bart?
And how did he manage to write his name in solid cement?
He must've been smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing.
Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology.
Ay caramba!
- What's normal to him amazes us.
- He will be our new god.
Good, somebody's shadow.
I'll just turn and brag about my work.
Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property.
It was an accident.
I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart.
- What would Jebediah Springfield say?
- He'd be cool with it.
Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?
What for?
Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family.
Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?
It's been going down since the lake caught fire.
Now, just a darn minute.
This town is a part of who you are.
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap.
When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield.
When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield.
When you make lemonade from our trees, you're drinking Springfield.
Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.
You have roots in this town, and you ought to show respect.
This town is a part of us all.
A part of us all.
A part of us all.
Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you remember.
This town is a part of us all.
A part of us all.
A part of us all.
Wow, that does work.
When it comes to catching trout, nothing beats the German light infantry.
Beautiful, aren't they?
Yep.
I'm gonna huck them at cars.
Hey, Milhouse.
How's the lemonade business?
It's clearly booming, Bart.
I don't even want any.
I just bought a pity glass.
We've squozen our whole supply.
To the lemon tree!
Thar she grows.
You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking.
This town ain't so bad.
Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings.
When you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.
Springfield sucks.
Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man.
- Why don't you make me.
- I don't make trash, I burn it.
- Then I guess you're a garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- Oh, I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- Takes one to know one.
- Checkmate.
- Hey, kid.
Stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder.
- We invented that.
Copycat.
- You copied us.
Step over this line and say that.
I'll kick your butt at Nintendo.
I just put a rock in your crummy town.
That's a crud rock.
It belongs in Crudtown.
Look at the weak little baby.
You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, they're taking our lemons.
We can't spare a single one.
You just got citric acid in my eye.
You'll pay for that, Springfield.
Some things never change.
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.
Grampa's the name.
Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?
Shut up!
It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan.
People, our search is over.
On this site, we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely govern justly and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
- Yes, and marry our cousins.
- I was...
What are you talking about, Shelbyville?
Why would we marry our cousins?
Because they're so attractive.
I thought that was the whole point of this journey.
- Absolutely not.
- I tell you I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins.
Well, then we'll form our own town.
Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm?
The town of Springfield was born on that day.
And to mark that sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.
Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot.
You know what?
They're not.
- I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
- Class, please.
If you don't learn Roman numerals you'll never know when movies were copyrighted.
Come quick.
Something's happened.
No time to explain.
No, children.
No.
Your education is important.
Roman numerals, et cetera.
Whatever.
I tried.
Are you sure it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened?
No.
I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that.
The lemon tree's gone.
And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.
Oh, look, a clue.
A candy-bar wrapper.
Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville.
- They love the sweet taste.
- We gotta get that tree back.
You mean going to Shelbyville?
We'll never make it out alive.
That lemon tree's part of our town and, as kids, the backbone of our economy.
We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead.
Hey, Milhouse, get your invasion supplies, and let's go.
Get him.
Come on.
- Where did he go?
- Over here, my friends.
Or is it over here?
Yeah.
Here's how it goes.
I'm the leader.
Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.
Nelson's the tough guy.
Martin's the smart guy.
Todd's the religious guy who ends up going crazy.
And now the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger.
To step out of childhood and become men.
If you get lost, remember you can always find east by staring directly at the sun.
Here's a tip.
Put a pinch of sage in your boots and all day long, a spicy scent is your reward.
Oh, my gosh.
Look.
The fire hydrants here are yellow.
This place is starting to freak me out.
Danger coming.
Behind us.
What is it, boy?
Is there something behind that wall we should beat up?
No time to check it out now.
We've got lemonade to sell.
Radical.
They're getting rich off us.
And that kid with the backpack said "radical."
I say "radical." That's my thing that I say.
I feel like I'm gonna explode here.
It's lunchtime.
Do you know where your brother's tutoring?
Tutoring?
The only thing Bart's teaching is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.
- You have a number we can reach him?
- No, Mom.
Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville.
Homer, come quick.
Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence gang.
The trail has become indistinct.
I suggest we split up to cover more ground.
Good idea.
Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team.
Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force.
- Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
- Team Discovery Channel.
Your wussiness better come in handy.
- What's going on?
- I want some answers.
Okay, folks, look, I called the police captain in Shelbyville.
He says he hasn't seen our kids.
But if they show up in the morgue, he's gonna fax us.
- Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.
- Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.
And it tears me up inside.
This is my fault.
I tried to teach Bart about town pride.
But the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.
Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech.
If anything turned him bad it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear.
- And let's not forget your little speech.
- Isn't there anything we can do?
Yes, there is.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves.
I got an RV we can use.
- Flanders'.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.
Pile in, everybody.
No time to wipe your feet.
Come on.
Okay, piglet, start squealing.
Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade?
This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.
There's never been anything close to a lemon in it.
I swear.
Hey.
Nobody hassles my little brother.
Hey.
And no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.
Spring forth, burly protector, and save me.
Jeez.
I never hang out with him, normally.
Hark to the tale of Nelson And the boy he loved so dear
They remained the best of friends For years and years and years
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.
It's no use, Milhouse.
If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover.
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.
Wait a minute.
If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?
- Five.
- Story checks out.
We just got word there's Springfield kids in town.
Curse those handsome devils.
We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield sucks" in huge letters.
That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.
You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now.
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.
No, not in my mouth is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.
Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors.
You know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town.
Missing children?
Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.
Maybe that's why we beat them at football nearly half the time, huh?
Quit stalling, kid.
Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters.
His can control is excellent.
Yes.
And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles.
That's right, the stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.
You know, Bart Simpson.
- From Springfield?
- He's from Springfield.
Get him!
I'll use these spray cans as jetpacks and fly to safety.
So long, losers.
You're dead.
Hey, look.
Someone's attractive cousin.
- Where?
Where?
- I don't see anybody.
So he thinks he can out-skateboard me, huh?
Launch me, boys.
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing cube-gleamers.
"Wet cement."
I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
You had your chance.
Safe at last.
"Caution:
Exit through door seven only.
All other rooms contain man-eating tigers."
Roman numerals.
They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Milhouse, what's seven in Roman numerals?
I'll tell you, but you really should end each transmission with the word "over."
- Over.
- Correction:
The only thing that's over is that transmission.
Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?
- But Milhouse is my name.
- But I thought I was the only one.
A pain I know all too well.
So this is what it feels like when doves cry.
Milhouse.
Milhouse.
Now what do I do?
Wait.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it.
Okay, think, Bart.
Where have you seen Roman numerals before?
I know.
Rocky V. That was the fifth one.
So Rocky V plus Rocky II equals Rocky VII:
Adrian's Revenge!
Come back here.
It's no use.
I'm never gonna find that tree.
This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.
Wait a minute.
There's a lemon behind that rock.
The tree!
A car impound lot.
The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.
- We'll never get the tree back now.
- Keep your voices down, boys.
- We didn't get this far to get found out.
- Found them!
You kids are in big trouble.
- Running away from home like this.
- But they stole our lemon tree.
I don't care what excuse you've got.
Nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech.
You're gonna...
Lemon tree?
That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers.
Give it back, or we'll bust in there and take it.
Bust in here and take it?
- You must stupider than you look.
- Stupider like a fox!
I'm okay.
Don't you get it, Springfield?
It's over.
You lose.
Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.
If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
There's got to be a way to get that tree back.
Hey, look.
A hospital.
Pull in there.
Oh, great.
Now I'm upside down.
Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone.
No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
I'll get the gate.
That's okay, son.
I'll take care of him.
Faster, son!
He's got a taste for meat now.
Get out here, son.
There's a-doings a-transpiring.
Let's shut the gate and seal them in.
Gun it, Flanders.
It won't start.
Something's draining the battery.
Sorry.
We made it.
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.
- Eat my shorts.
- Eat my shorts.
Yes, eat all of our shirts.
Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...
Shake harder, boy.
We did it!
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield.
They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil.
And though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee he could easily afford it.
- More lemonade, Bart?
- Absolutely.
Say when.
There are over 14 parts of the lemon that are...
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville.
They had banished the awful lemon tree forever because it was haunted.
Now, let's all celebrate with a cool glass of turnip juice.
Lemon of Troy
"Wet cement."
Is there any sweeter sign?
Well, maybe "high voltage."
Hello, son.
You want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented?
- No time.
- Okay.
This is for the ages.
Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery.
Who was Bart?
And how did he manage to write his name in solid cement?
He must've been smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing.
Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology.
Ay caramba!
- What's normal to him amazes us.
- He will be our new god.
Good, somebody's shadow.
I'll just turn and brag about my work.
Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property.
It was an accident.
I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart.
- What would Jebediah Springfield say?
- He'd be cool with it.
Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?
What for?
Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family.
Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?
It's been going down since the lake caught fire.
Now, just a darn minute.
This town is a part of who you are.
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap.
When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield.
When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield.
When you make lemonade from our trees, you're drinking Springfield.
Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.
You have roots in this town, and you ought to show respect.
This town is a part of us all.
A part of us all.
A part of us all.
Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you remember.
This town is a part of us all.
A part of us all.
A part of us all.
Wow, that does work.
- Hey, gonna win some this season?
- Gonna try.
When it comes to catching trout, nothing beats the German light infantry.
Beautiful, aren't they?
Yep.
I'm gonna huck them at cars.
Hey, Milhouse.
How's the lemonade business?
It's clearly booming, Bart.
I don't even want any.
I just bought a pity glass.
We've squozen our whole supply.
To the lemon tree!
Thar she grows.
You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking.
This town ain't so bad.
Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings.
When you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.
Springfield sucks.
Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man.
- Why don't you make me.
- I don't make trash, I burn it.
- Then I guess you're a garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- Oh, I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- Takes one to know one.
- Checkmate.
- Hey, kid.
Stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder.
- We invented that.
Copycat.
- You copied us.
Step over this line and say that.
I'll kick your butt at Nintendo.
I just put a rock in your crummy town.
That's a crud rock.
It belongs in Crudtown.
Look at the weak little baby.
You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, they're taking our lemons.
We can't spare a single one.
You just got citric acid in my eye.
You'll pay for that, Springfield.
Some things never change.
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.
Grampa's the name.
Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?
Shut up!
It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan.
People, our search is over.
On this site, we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely govern justly and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
- Yes, and marry our cousins.
- I was...
What are you talking about, Shelbyville?
Why would we marry our cousins?
Because they're so attractive.
I thought that was the whole point of this journey.
- Absolutely not.
- I tell you I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins.
Well, then we'll form our own town.
Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm?
The town of Springfield was born on that day.
And to mark that sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.
Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot.
You know what?
They're not.
- I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
- Class, please.
If you don't learn Roman numerals you'll never know when movies were copyrighted.
Come quick.
Something's happened.
No time to explain.
No, children.
No.
Your education is important.
Roman numerals, et cetera.
Whatever.
I tried.
Are you sure it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened?
No.
I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that.
The lemon tree's gone.
And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.
Oh, look, a clue.
A candy-bar wrapper.
Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville.
- They love the sweet taste.
- We gotta get that tree back.
You mean going to Shelbyville?
We'll never make it out alive.
That lemon tree's part of our town and, as kids, the backbone of our economy.
We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead.
Where are you going, Bart?
Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said got through to me.
And now, I am going to teach some kids a lesson.
- I choose to take that literally.
- Death to Shelbyville!
Yes, Bart's a tutor now.
Tute on, son.
Tute on.
Hey, Milhouse, get your invasion supplies, and let's go.
Get him.
Come on.
- Where did he go?
- Over here, my friends.
Or is it over here?
Yeah.
Here's how it goes.
I'm the leader.
Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.
Nelson's the tough guy.
Martin's the smart guy.
Todd's the religious guy who ends up going crazy.
And now the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger.
To step out of childhood and become men.
If you get lost, remember you can always find east by staring directly at the sun.
Here's a tip.
Put a pinch of sage in your boots and all day long, a spicy scent is your reward.
Oh, my gosh.
Look.
The fire hydrants here are yellow.
This place is starting to freak me out.
Danger coming.
Behind us.
What is it, boy?
Is there something behind that wall we should beat up?
No time to check it out now.
We've got lemonade to sell.
Radical.
They're getting rich off us.
And that kid with the backpack said "radical."
I say "radical." That's my thing that I say.
I feel like I'm gonna explode here.
It's lunchtime.
Do you know where your brother's tutoring?
Tutoring?
The only thing Bart's teaching is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.
- You have a number we can reach him?
- No, Mom.
Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville.
Homer, come quick.
Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence gang.
The trail has become indistinct.
I suggest we split up to cover more ground.
Good idea.
Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team.
Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force.
- Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
- Team Discovery Channel.
Your wussiness better come in handy.
- What's going on?
- I want some answers.
Okay, folks, look, I called the police captain in Shelbyville.
He says he hasn't seen our kids.
But if they show up in the morgue, he's gonna fax us.
- Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.
- Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.
And it tears me up inside.
This is my fault.
I tried to teach Bart about town pride.
But the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.
Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech.
If anything turned him bad it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear.
- And let's not forget your little speech.
- Isn't there anything we can do?
Yes, there is.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves.
I got an RV we can use.
- Flanders'.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.
Pile in, everybody.
No time to wipe your feet.
Come on.
Okay, piglet, start squealing.
Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade?
This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.
There's never been anything close to a lemon in it.
I swear.
Hey.
Nobody hassles my little brother.
Hey.
And no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.
Spring forth, burly protector, and save me.
Jeez.
I never hang out with him, normally.
Hark to the tale of Nelson And the boy he loved so dear
They remained the best of friends For years and years and years
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.
It's no use, Milhouse.
If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover.
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.
Wait a minute.
If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?
- Five.
- Story checks out.
We just got word there's Springfield kids in town.
Curse those handsome devils.
We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield sucks" in huge letters.
That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.
You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now.
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.
No, not in my mouth is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.

Wait a minute.
If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?
- Five.
- Story checks out.
We just got word there's Springfield kids in town.
Curse those handsome devils.
We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield sucks" in huge letters.
That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.
You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now.
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.
No, not in my mouth is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.
Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors.
You know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town.
Missing children?
Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.
Maybe that's why we beat them at football nearly half the time, huh?
Quit stalling, kid.
Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters.
His can control is excellent.
Yes.
And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles.
That's right, the stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.
You know, Bart Simpson.
- From Springfield?
- He's from Springfield.
Get him!
I'll use these spray cans as jetpacks and fly to safety.
So long, losers.
You're dead.
Hey, look.
Someone's attractive cousin.
- Where?
Where?
- I don't see anybody.
So he thinks he can out-skateboard me, huh?
Launch me, boys.
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing cube-gleamers.
"Wet cement."
I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
You had your chance.
Safe at last.
"Caution:
Exit through door seven only.
All other rooms contain man-eating tigers."
Roman numerals.
They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Milhouse, what's seven in Roman numerals?
I'll tell you, but you really should end each transmission with the word "over."
- Over.
- Correction:
The only thing that's over is that transmission.
Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?
- But Milhouse is my name.
- But I thought I was the only one.
A pain I know all too well.
So this is what it feels like when doves cry.
Milhouse.
Milhouse.
Now what do I do?
Wait.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it.
Okay, think, Bart.
Where have you seen Roman numerals before?
I know.
Rocky V. That was the fifth one.
So Rocky V plus Rocky II equals Rocky VII:
Adrian's Revenge!
Come back here.
It's no use.
I'm never gonna find that tree.
This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.
Wait a minute.
There's a lemon behind that rock.
The tree!
A car impound lot.
The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.
- We'll never get the tree back now.
- Keep your voices down, boys.
- We didn't get this far to get found out.
- Found them!
You kids are in big trouble.
- Running away from home like this.
- But they stole our lemon tree.
I don't care what excuse you've got.
Nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech.
You're gonna...
Lemon tree?
That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers.
Give it back, or we'll bust in there and take it.
Bust in here and take it?
- You must stupider than you look.
- Stupider like a fox!
I'm okay.
Don't you get it, Springfield?
It's over.
You lose.
Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.
If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
There's got to be a way to get that tree back.
Hey, look.
A hospital.
Pull in there.
Oh, great.
Now I'm upside down.
Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone.
No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
I'll get the gate.
That's okay, son.
I'll take care of him.
Faster, son!
He's got a taste for meat now.
Get out here, son.
There's a-doings a-transpiring.
Let's shut the gate and seal them in.
Gun it, Flanders.
It won't start.
Something's draining the battery.
Sorry.
We made it.
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.
- Eat my shorts.
- Eat my shorts.
Yes, eat all of our shirts.
Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...
Shake harder, boy.
We did it!
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield.
They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil.
And though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee he could easily afford it.
- More lemonade, Bart?
- Absolutely.
Say when.
There are over 14 parts of the lemon that are...
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville.
They had banished the awful lemon tree forever because it was haunted.
Now, let's all celebrate with a cool glass of turnip juice.
Lemon of Troy
"Wet cement."
Is there any sweeter sign?
Well, maybe "high voltage."
Hello, son.
You want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented?
- No time.
- Okay.
This is for the ages.
Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery.
Who was Bart?
And how did he manage to write his name in solid cement?
He must've been smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing.
Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology.
Ay caramba!
- What's normal to him amazes us.
- He will be our new god.
Good, somebody's shadow.
I'll just turn and brag about my work.
Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property.
It was an accident.
I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart.
- What would Jebediah Springfield say?
- He'd be cool with it.
Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?
What for?
Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family.
Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?
It's been going down since the lake caught fire.
Now, just a darn minute.
This town is a part of who you are.
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap.
When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield.
When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield.
When you make lemonade from our trees, you're drinking Springfield.
Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.
You have roots in this town, and you ought to show respect.
This town is a part of us all.
A part of us all.
A part of us all.
Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you remember.
This town is a part of us all.
A part of us all.
A part of us all.
Wow, that does work.
- Hey, gonna win some this season?
- Gonna try.
When it comes to catching trout, nothing beats the German light infantry.
Beautiful, aren't they?
Yep.
I'm gonna huck them at cars.
Hey, Milhouse.
How's the lemonade business?
It's clearly booming, Bart.
I don't even want any.
I just bought a pity glass.
We've squozen our whole supply.
To the lemon tree!
Thar she grows.
You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking.
This town ain't so bad.
Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings.
When you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.
Springfield sucks.
Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man.
- Why don't you make me.
- I don't make trash, I burn it.
- Then I guess you're a garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- Oh, I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- A garbage man.
- Takes one to know one.
- Checkmate.
- Hey, kid.
Stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder.
- We invented that.
Copycat.
- You copied us.
Step over this line and say that.
I'll kick your butt at Nintendo.
I just put a rock in your crummy town.
That's a crud rock.
It belongs in Crudtown.
Look at the weak little baby.
You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, they're taking our lemons.
We can't spare a single one.
You just got citric acid in my eye.
You'll pay for that, Springfield.
Some things never change.
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.
Grampa's the name.
Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?
Shut up!
It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan.
People, our search is over.
On this site, we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely govern justly and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
- Yes, and marry our cousins.
- I was...
What are you talking about, Shelbyville?
Why would we marry our cousins?
Because they're so attractive.
I thought that was the whole point of this journey.
- Absolutely not.
- I tell you I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins.
Well, then we'll form our own town.
Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm?
The town of Springfield was born on that day.
And to mark that sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.
Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot.
You know what?
They're not.
- I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
- Class, please.
If you don't learn Roman numerals you'll never know when movies were copyrighted.
Come quick.
Something's happened.
No time to explain.
No, children.
No.
Your education is important.
Roman numerals, et cetera.
Whatever.
I tried.
Are you sure it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened?
No.
I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that.
The lemon tree's gone.
And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.
Oh, look, a clue.
A candy-bar wrapper.
Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville.
- They love the sweet taste.
- We gotta get that tree back.
You mean going to Shelbyville?
We'll never make it out alive.
That lemon tree's part of our town and, as kids, the backbone of our economy.
We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead.
Where are you going, Bart?
Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said got through to me.
And now, I am going to teach some kids a lesson.
- I choose to take that literally.
- Death to Shelbyville!
Yes, Bart's a tutor now.
Tute on, son.
Tute on.
Hey, Milhouse, get your invasion supplies, and let's go.
Get him.
Come on.
- Where did he go?
- Over here, my friends.
Or is it over here?
Yeah.
Here's how it goes.
I'm the leader.
Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.
Nelson's the tough guy.
Martin's the smart guy.
Todd's the religious guy who ends up going crazy.
And now the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger.
To step out of childhood and become men.
If you get lost, remember you can always find east by staring directly at the sun.
Here's a tip.
Put a pinch of sage in your boots and all day long, a spicy scent is your reward.
Oh, my gosh.
Look.
The fire hydrants here are yellow.
This place is starting to freak me out.
Danger coming.
Behind us.
What is it, boy?
Is there something behind that wall we should beat up?
No time to check it out now.
We've got lemonade to sell.
Radical.
They're getting rich off us.
And that kid with the backpack said "radical."
I say "radical." That's my thing that I say.
I feel like I'm gonna explode here.
It's lunchtime.
Do you know where your brother's tutoring?
Tutoring?
The only thing Bart's teaching is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.
- You have a number we can reach him?
- No, Mom.
Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville.
Homer, come quick.
Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence gang.
The trail has become indistinct.
I suggest we split up to cover more ground.
Good idea.
Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team.
Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force.
- Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
- Team Discovery Channel.
Your wussiness better come in handy.
- What's going on?
- I want some answers.
Okay, folks, look, I called the police captain in Shelbyville.
He says he hasn't seen our kids.
But if they show up in the morgue, he's gonna fax us.
- Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.
- Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.
And it tears me up inside.
This is my fault.
I tried to teach Bart about town pride.
But the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.
Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech.
If anything turned him bad it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear.
- And let's not forget your little speech.
- Isn't there anything we can do?
Yes, there is.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves.
I got an RV we can use.
- Flanders'.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.
Pile in, everybody.
No time to wipe your feet.
Come on.
Okay, piglet, start squealing.
Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade?
This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.
There's never been anything close to a lemon in it.
I swear.
Hey.
Nobody hassles my little brother.
Hey.
And no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.
Spring forth, burly protector, and save me.
Jeez.
I never hang out with him, normally.
Hark to the tale of Nelson And the boy he loved so dear
They remained the best of friends For years and years and years
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.
It's no use, Milhouse.
If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover.
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.
Wait a minute.

I never hang out with him, normally.
Hark to the tale of Nelson And the boy he loved so dear
They remained the best of friends For years and years and years
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.
It's no use, Milhouse.
If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover.
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.
Wait a minute.
If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?
- Five.
- Story checks out.
We just got word there's Springfield kids in town.
Curse those handsome devils.
We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield sucks" in huge letters.
That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.
You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now.
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.
No, not in my mouth is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.
Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors.
You know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town.
Missing children?
Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.
Maybe that's why we beat them at football nearly half the time, huh?
Quit stalling, kid.
Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters.
His can control is excellent.
Yes.
And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles.
That's right, the stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.
You know, Bart Simpson.
- From Springfield?
- He's from Springfield.
Get him!
I'll use these spray cans as jetpacks and fly to safety.
So long, losers.
You're dead.
Hey, look.
Someone's attractive cousin.
- Where?
Where?
- I don't see anybody.
So he thinks he can out-skateboard me, huh?
Launch me, boys.
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing cube-gleamers.
"Wet cement."
I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
You had your chance.
Safe at last.
"Caution:
Exit through door seven only.
All other rooms contain man-eating tigers."
Roman numerals.
They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Milhouse, what's seven in Roman numerals?
I'll tell you, but you really should end each transmission with the word "over."
- Over.
- Correction:
The only thing that's over is that transmission.
Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?
- But Milhouse is my name.
- But I thought I was the only one.
A pain I know all too well.
So this is what it feels like when doves cry.
Milhouse.
Milhouse.
Now what do I do?
Wait.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it.
Okay, think, Bart.
Where have you seen Roman numerals before?
I know.
Rocky V. That was the fifth one.
So Rocky V plus Rocky II equals Rocky VII:
Adrian's Revenge!
Come back here.
It's no use.
I'm never gonna find that tree.
This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.
Wait a minute.
There's a lemon behind that rock.
The tree!
A car impound lot.
The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.
- We'll never get the tree back now.
- Keep your voices down, boys.
- We didn't get this far to get found out.
- Found them!
You kids are in big trouble.
- Running away from home like this.
- But they stole our lemon tree.
I don't care what excuse you've got.
Nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech.
You're gonna...
Lemon tree?
That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers.
Give it back, or we'll bust in there and take it.
Bust in here and take it?
- You must stupider than you look.
- Stupider like a fox!
I'm okay.
Don't you get it, Springfield?
It's over.
You lose.
Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.
If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
There's got to be a way to get that tree back.
Hey, look.
A hospital.
Pull in there.
Oh, great.
Now I'm upside down.
Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone.
No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
I'll get the gate.
That's okay, son.
I'll take care of him.
Faster, son!
He's got a taste for meat now.
Get out here, son.
There's a-doings a-transpiring.
Let's shut the gate and seal them in.
Gun it, Flanders.
It won't start.
Something's draining the battery.
Sorry.
We made it.
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.
- Eat my shorts.
- Eat my shorts.
Yes, eat all of our shirts.
Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...
Shake harder, boy.
We did it!
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield.
They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil.
And though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee he could easily afford it.
- More lemonade, Bart?
- Absolutely.
Say when.
There are over 14 parts of the lemon that are...
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville.
They had banished the awful lemon tree forever because it was haunted.
Now, let's all celebrate with a cool glass of turnip juice.
Three cheers for Freakazoid.
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Thanks, Freakazoid.
You saved the lives of everyone in the city.
As well as the entire free world.
And on behalf of the United Kingdom I want to personally thank you, Freakazoid, in a very personal way if you catch my drift.
Yeah, well, cool your jets, princess, and wait your turn.
- He's taken.
- Sharon.
Why, you tramp.
Who you calling a tramp, you stuck up little...?
How dare you.
Come on, yeah.
Right now.
Dl:
I'm not afraid of you.
How dare you?
Ow!
Dl:
I am not accustomed to your style nor your manner.
Now, ladies, ladies, calm down.
There is plenty of me for everybody.
If not, I'll just have them draw me bigger.
This was without a doubt the most exciting Freakavoid...
Let me try this again.
Take two.
This was without a doubt the most exciting Freakazoid adventure of all time.
Hey, kids, sorry you missed it, but I got started early today.
But tell me, Freakazoid how did you know how to deactivate this 800-megaton nuclear warhead?
Simple.
I read the instruction manual.
See?
You just raise the plunger to deactivate the warhead and you push the plunger to reactivate it.
Ooh, boy.
That was about as stupid as me raising taxes.
Allow me to be the first one to say "ouch. "
Mm.
Hello, kiddies.
I'm the network censor and I just want to assure our young viewers out there that no one was hurt in the previous scene.
Everyone is okay.
Including me.
Oof!
The aliens may bring to us the wisdom of the universe.
If not, we'll blast them.
I am Mo-Ron.
I come with a important message for all mankind.
And what is that message?
I am Mo-Ron.
Do you come in peace or war?
Ooh!
Muh...
I am Mo-Ron.
What is your purpose here?
Oh!
I am Mo-Ron.
Blast him.
Uh, let me try something.
Tell us, what is two plus two?
Twenty-two.
I am Mo-Ron.
We can pretty much rule out the wisdom of the universe.
Then let's blast him.
Twenty-three?
Mm.
Hello again.
I'm the network censor.
And before I was so rudely interrupted I just wanted to say that no one was hurt in the previous scene.
Oh.
Ugh!
He feels no pain He can fly quite fast
In feats of strength He is unsurpassed
His grip is firm Never quavery
Britannia's superhero He's Lord Bravery
Lord Bravery, Lord Bravery
Lord Bravery
Oh, let's just get on with it.
Nigel, the tea's ready.
Nigel, the tea.
- Nigel.
- Ouch!
I thought he was impervious to pain.
I am impervious to...
Do I take it the ficus hurled at my head was meant as some sort of signal?
- The tea's ready.
- Then get it.
Well, you are up, darling.
Oh, yes, let me get the tea.
I'd hate to see either of you actually have to walk the 3 feet into this frightening, mysterious new world we call a kitchen.
You might get lost or attacked by the dishwasher.
Your tea.
You forgot the sugar.
Most people your age die.
Why won't you?
There's no need to be rude, Nigel.
Not being rude, darling.
Merely a suggestion.
Why doesn't he get a job?
This is my job, you old bat.
If I don't monitor the emergency frequencies I won't know who needs rescuing.
Mother does have a point, Nigel.
This superhero business doesn't seem to be paying off.
Well, not yet, but it will.
You think Superman started right at the top?
Yes.
Well, yes, he did, he did, but not the others.
It takes years to establish yourself as a superhero.
All the same, a little less time listening to your radios and more time spent rescuing people might be better.
Well, what do you expect me to do just fly around all day looking for people to save?
Good idea.
And get some milk while you're at it.
And some sugar.
Oh, and, Nigel, some chickpeas for the salad.
And bouillon cubes.
Yes, Mother needs her bouillon cubes.
And some sticky buns.
Don't forget the sticky buns.
"Don't forget the sticky buns. "
Help!
Ah!
Help!
Help!
It's all right, my good man.
Fear not, Lord Bravery has arrived.
Young boy, right, okay, right.
Here's a video camera.
Be a good lad and get a few shots of me rescuing the man from that hole, all right?
A nice wide shot, not too much headroom and a nice background...
Help!
Yes, yes, we have heard you.
We're not deaf, you know.
What was I saying?
Yes, uh, not too much headroom and try to keep the camera from shaking, okay?
Ready?
I'll find you, you little...
- Help!
- Would you stop yelling?
Sorry.
All right, all right.
What's the problem?
I fell in this hole.
I'm trapped.
Fine, hold on.
I'll come and get you.
- What's that smell?
- I think I fell in the sewer.
The sew...?
Oh!
Well, can't you climb out?
If I could climb out, I wouldn't be yelling "help," now, would I?
Well, you could have at least yelled, "Help, I'm trapped in a sewer. "
- What would that have done?
- Saved me a trip.
Do you think you could get me Superman?
Oh, Superman?
What do you need with him?
I'm a superhero, aren't I?
I don't know.
Are you?
Yes, I told you.
I said, "Fear not, Lord Bravery has arrived. "
Oh, I thought that was a joke.
A joke?
Yeah, you know, to keep me from focusing on my horrible pain.
- Yes, well, it's not a joke.
- Good, because it didn't work.
Look, I'm going to throw a rope down to you.
A rope?
I thought you were gonna come get me.
From the sewer?
Superman would do it.
Well, he's not here.
Could you go get him?
Look, just grab onto the rope and I'll pull you up.
Or maybe you could get those turtle fellows with the bandannas.
I don't think they'd mind the stench down here too much.
In fact, I think they'd rather like it.
You are a remarkable twit.
Do you know that?
In fact, I think those turtles live in the sewers.
Listen, would you please stop talking and just grab onto the rope, all right?
Whoa!
Do you want to call for Superman or should I?
Oh, fine.
We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you this special report from The WB Network.
What exactly is The WB?
Can someone tell me this?
What's it mean, "The WB"?
The water bucket?
The wimpy boy?
The wet bananas?
I don't know what.
The weird butt?
What?
I'm asking.
This has been a special report from the Weird Butt Network.
We now join Freakazoid, already in progress.
That's Uranus.
Greetings, inhabitants of planet Earth.
Uh, greetings.
I have traveled many millions of light-years across 40 billion galaxies to come here for the answer to a vital question that concerns the entire universe.
And what is that question?
Please tell us:
That doll, Barbie, what's the name of her little sister?
Hey, all I can think of is Pebbles.
Let me handle this.
It's Skipper.
Skipper.
Huh.
Hey, everyone, it's Skipper.
I am Mo-Ron.
Now, knock that off.
Oh, now I've hurt his feelings.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Mo-Ron forgive.
Lucky me.
And now...
This concludes our musical interlude.
We now return to our program.
And now...
Candid conversations with the superheroes of yesteryear.
Aquaman is staring at Zippy's food, so Zippy the fast boy says:
"Hey, I'm having the shrimp scampi here. "
And Aquaman says, "That ain't no shrimp scampi.
That's my Uncle Leo. "
I was with Aquaman outside Sy's Clam Bar once when we ran into the Green Fog.
Oy, what a stink.
The Green Fog?
Piffle.
Like lilacs in springtime.
You want to fight a stench, try doing battle with the Brown Fog.
Now, that was a smelly fog.
He'd creep up on you too.
You'd be standing there, minding your own business then out from nowhere, a smell oy, like something crawled under the porch and died.
And there he is, the Brown Fog, choking you, your eyes burning.
I thought I was gonna die.
- Well, what'd you do?
- What could I do?
I lit a match, he blew up.
End of story.
Hey, blue boy, did you check the pastrami?
How do know it ain't got a bomb in it, huh?
I have many enemies.
Get it away from me.
Yes, sir.
Hurry, it's gonna blow.
"I lit a match. "
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Well, that's our show.
I hope you had as much fun watching it as we had making it.
You're not the boss of me.
I'll make you...
I've a parking space.
I'll show you.
I own everything in the world.
I've got my own parking space, you do not.
I drive your car.
Ahh, come to think of it I hope you had more fun watching it than we had making it.
So till next time.
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
I am Mo-Ron.
You're still here, huh?
I come with a important message for all mankind.
Yeah, so we've heard.
Wonderful.
Me remember message.
Could it be, "I am Mo-Ron"?
No, it is, uh, um...
A giant comet heading to Earth.
Now he tells us.
All right, folks.
That's all we have time for today.
We have to run.
So next time, don't forget to freak out.
Mm.
Hello...

We have left work behind.
That's why we don't have any clips to show from the next episode of Freakazoid.

[ENGLISH SDH]
- Hello, Karos.
- Good morning, Lyla.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- So far.
That'll be two dinars.
- Two dinars.
- Ten dinars.
- You just sold it to her for two.
- Well, so, she got a deal.
- You're a greedy little bigot.
- And you're a centaur-loving slut.
Let's not mar a beautiful day like today with violence.
Get your filthy hands off me!
Leave me alone!
Ow!
Is there a problem, Lyla?
No, no problem.
Your little wench, here was--
She's not a wench.
She's my wife and her name is Lyla.
- Deric, don't.
- Say it!
- Lyla.
- Thank you.
Filthy centaurs.
We'll have to teach him a lesson.
Quiet.
Here it is.
Keifer.
Wake up.
I want you to run to a safe spot in the woods.
- I'll come for you later.
- But, Mommy--
Do as I say.
Humans or centaurs, nothing instills fear like fire.
It's worse for centaurs it's the horse in them.
- What if someone gets hurt?
- We're just scaring them.
Come on!
Get out!
Get out!
No, don't!
You'll kill her!
Here!
Come on!
Quick!
Run!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
We've got company!
Wait.
I, I think there's someone still inside.
Forget it!
Let's get out of here!
We can't just leave her.
Come on!
Cletus.
Lyla!
Keifer!
This is the story of a time long ago.
A time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they plagued mankind with suffering.
Only one man dared to challenge their power-Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth, battling the minions of wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be Hercules.
Hercules!
My powerful, positive friend!
- Mmmmmmmmmmmm.
- Salmoneus, are you OK?
Couldn't be better.
Just finished a self-actualization seminar with Robertus Tonicles.
Man's a genius makes money hand over fist.
I'll bet.
Tell me, what, exactly, is a self-actualization seminar?
It helps you fertilize the nurturing flower within.
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.
- What's with the humming?
- That's the internal harmonic, that leads you to the flower.
It helps you be.
And what is it you want to be?
I wanna be the best possible Salmoneus I can be.
And I wanna teach seminars.
I wanna help others be the best possible thing they can be for a modest price.
- I'm sure you'll do well.
- Desire, focus, grab, hum.
- Mmmmmmmmmmm.
- Sounds like fun.
You have no idea.
Hey, seems like we're going the same way mind if I tag along?
- Mmmmmmmm.
- As long as you don't hum.
I can do that.
So, where're you off to?
Athens.
Some friends of mine are having problems.
Remember Lyla?
Oh, that girl who went off with the centaur?
Yeah, they're finding the locals even less friendly than they were in Nespa.
Oh-ho, dear.
Lyla...
Lyla... do-does she remind you of anyone we both know?
Come to think of it, she looks a little like Xena.
Yeah-hah!
Different dispostion, though, huh?
This is all that's left of their house.
The fire was so hot, you could see the flames all the way into town.
Even the bodies were reduced to ashes.
- What an awful way to die.
- What is this?
- I don't know.
- I know that's the symbol of the Cretans.
- They're the guardians of the--
- Darius!
He's just a foolish lad, full of wild stories.
- I'd like to hear more.
- We don't know anything.
Come, Darius, we must get home.
Deric and Lyla didn't deserve to die like this.
They were good people.
I take it you don't think the fire was an accident.
No, I don't.
Let's go find out more about these Cretans.
That's an interesting tattoo.
- Does it signify anything?
- Yeah, purity and strength.
Is that so?
Hmm, I saw a mark just like it
- at the house that burned down.
- You mean the centaur's house.
Shame about that.
Stranger, let me give you some advice.
We don't care for their kind around here.
- What kind is that?
- Huh, that should be obvious.
Just look at them.
They're not like us.
That's a relief.
Huh, you know the difference between a centaur and a three-legged dog?
People died in that fire!
I don't wanna hear any centaur jokes!
Stop!
Hasn't there been enough violence and suffering already?
- Who are you?
- My name is Lariphany.
I'm Lyla's sister.
- So, you're Hercules.
- Let's keep that between us for now.
I guess that's how bad things got, that Lyla you for help.
- I came as soon as I could.
- It's hard enough losing them that way, but her son was barely three years old.
- They had a child.
- Oh, yes, he was born while they still lived in Nespa one of the reasons why they left was so they could bring him up in a more accepting environment.
Burning down homes with people inside isn't exactly what I call accepting.
No one thought it would come to that.
And actually, for a while, things were fine.
Deric got work as a farm hand,
Lyla took care of the house and Keifer.
- They were happy.
- What changed things?
The Cretans, they started poisoning the minds of the locals.
You know, why don't you tell me about these Cretans?
They're a mean-spirited bunch, claiming to protect the Athenian purity from contamination by foreigners minorities anyone who's different.
- And Deric stood up to them.
- He was brave and fearless
- they hated him for that.
- And none of his neighbors came to help.
The people around here are decent and hard-working but easily influenced, especially when times turn bad.
When the floods ruined the crops, it was easy to blame
Deric and Lyla for their troubles.
That poor child.
Jakar, Sepsis?
They're nosing around.
They're gonna be trouble.
Well, they're really not bothering anyone.
Look, we don't like centaurs in this town, and we don't like centaur-lovers.
It's that simple.
I say we give them a farewell party.
You!
I really think you should join me in the self-actualization field.
We've been through this before, I don't want to be part of your schemes.
It's not a scheme!
It's a way to help people.
Um, you're a hero to so many, you could help people reach their full potential be all they could be.
- Hmm, like you.
- Exactly.
Huh, uh-oh.
I think we've got company.
- Good company or bad company?
- I've got a feeling it's bad.
We hope you liked your little visit to our village.
- Ah-uh, we... we just got here, huh.
- You're not missing much, immigrant.
Ah-huh, uh, I really prefer you didn't call me that.
What would you like to be called?
That's, uh, 'Mister Immigrant' to you.
Well, Mister Immigrant, I'm about to brain you.
Wait!
Mmmmmmmmmmm.
- Why're you humming?
- I'm finding your internal flower.
Mmmmmmmmmmm.
Huh!
It's a weed!
Centaur...
Let's get him!
Behind you!
Behind you!
Yes!
Aaah.
Is there some reason you're trying to slap my hand?
I saw it in an athletic contest, once!
It's a way for winners to congratulate each other.
So, why don't they just say, 'Nice job,' or 'Congratulations'?
You need more fun in your life.
- You haven't seen the last of us.
- We can always hope.
Another round!
A mug of mead for my friend and we'll need two rooms for the night.
- Outsiders.
- What do they want?
- He knows the centaur.
- I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
Look, we just had this discussion with your tattooed friends.
The mead and the rooms.
This is not the way to attract a convention crowd.
This is the first but it won't be the last!
Deric!
Be quiet, listen!
The centaur has gone berserk.
We have to stop him before he kills again.
He's turned into a monster.
He's burned his own house, and he's killed his own family.
- Now, hold on, you don't know that!
- You don't know centaurs like we do.
Maybe I know them better.
I was raised and tutored by one.
The only way to protect ourselves is to track him down and kill him.
- He deserves a fair trial!
- Well, here's the magistrate.
You trust him?
Let him decide.
Wise Terseus.
We have a grave problem.
- The centaur, Deric, is not dead.
- He's gone mad.
He killed Cletus and then dumped the body at the roadhouse.
Then he must be brought in.
I'll need volunteers.
If the magistrate pleases we'd like to go along.
We don't need outsiders helping us.
I only wanna make sure the fugitive is brought back alive.
So be it.
The outsider and his companion will accompany you.
- Aah.
- As you wish, wise Terseus.
Get your weapons!
This is easy, boys.
We're on his tracks!
- Yeah, it's too easy.
- Easy is good.
You think, you think it's a trap?
Should I be worried?
This way!
There he is!
Let's get him!
- Looking for me?
- Let me talk to him!
He knows me.
Deric!
It's me, Hercules!
I promise, no harm will come to you if you give yourself up!
I'm not stopping until I avenge my wife's murder!
Don't make things worse!
You've already killed a man!
It was an accident, but he deserved to die.
Then let a court decide that!
Give up, and come back with us!
And what chance does a centaur have in a court of humans?
You have my word.
No, wait!
You murdering beast!
Soon you'll be joing your centaur-loving wife.
This is your fate too, Jakar!
I'll be back for you!
- And the others!
- Kill him.
Kill the monster!
Come.
This way.
Watch your back.
What are you waiting for?
Keep going!
Uh, Hercules, you don't wanna go in the swamp at night, do you?
I mean, there are bugs, and snakes, and little things that--
- No, we'll make camp here.
- Good choice.
Excellent choice.
Not that I wanna change your mind, but, uh, why don't you wanna go into the swamp?
'Cause we're on the wrong trail.
Centaurs don't like swamps.
Uh-huh?
Uh, shouldn't we be on the right trail?
We have time.
I don't think he's trying to run away.
We'll pick up his track at first light.
You're back early.
Giving up so soon?
Jakar called the search off till morning.
Two men from the village drowned.
Can't see anything out there.
So, Deric's still running around free.
- Thirsty?
- Thanks.
You weren't with those who attacked us yesterday.
Why not?
I have no quarrel with you.
Neither did your friends, that didn't stop them.
Sometimes, they get over-zealous.
Is that what happened at Deric's house?
I have no idea what happened at the centaur's house.
Don't you?
They're your friends.
You're not really fond of Deric, are you?
No, not really.
Look, my mother's sick.
And I can't even get hired at the farm where the centaur works, 'cause he does the job of three men.
Is that Deric's fault?
He had a family to provide for, too.
Does he get the pay of three men?
Democles, stay away from the outsiders.
Stick to your own kind.
What's gotten into him?
Do you think he knows more about Lyla's death than he's letting on?
No question about it.
Deric's tracks?
He made a false trail leading into the swamp.
Here's the way he really went.
Uh, shouldn't we get the others?
I'm not sure they care about bringing Deric back alive.
He probably spent the night there.
What?
What is it?
- Interesting tracks.
- What interesting?
Like bear tracks interesting?
Li...
like lion tracks interesting?
Li...
like crazed-centaur-ready -to-attack-us interesting?
What do you mean, interesting... huh?
- Come on.
- Come on?
- Mmmmmmmmm.
- You have nothing to worry about.
I mean, the guy's obviously deranged.
He's already killed two people.
What's to prevent him from sneaking up on us
- and attacking us from behind?
- Shh.
- I don't--
- Shh.
- I...
- I think if you were to keep quiet there'd be a lot less chance of him hearing us approach.
I could do that.
Thank you.
- Stay behind me.
- Good idea.
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Uh, Hercules.
No, but really--
- Quiet.
- You gotta take a look at this.
Don't be afraid.
We won't hurt you.
Don't move!
Do you come as friend or foe?
What do you think, Deric?
You once spared my life.
I can never be your enemy.
It seems like we've been here before.
The last time you were blind and helpless.
And I'm still indebted to you for not killing me then.
- I gave you my reasons.
- Can I move now?
Yeah.
Your battle with Nemis has grown into legend.
- You heard how he died?
- Only that it was at your hands.
There's more to it.
His cave started collapsing on us.
He held it up until I good get Penelope and Sharos out.
I'm glad he died a good death.
He wasn't always bad.
It's never too late to put hatred and vengeance behind you.
And you want me to do that now?
I don't think Lyla would've wanted you brought back on a stake.
Come, I'll take you to her if your friend will look after my son.
No problem.
Hi.
My name's Salmoneus.
Do you know how to hum?
Mmmmmmmmmmm.
Over here, these tracks.
They go up that way.
The centaur tricked us.
He won't get away this time.
- This was her favorite place.
- I'm truly sorry.
No more than I.
Ceridian, my mentor told me how much centaurs fear fire.
That had to be the hardest thing you ever did,
- going into that burning house.
- It was never a choice.
She was dead by the time I got to her.
There was nothing I could do.
Rest in peace, my darling.
I know what you're going through.
Revenge isn't the answer.
Oh, but it is.
I've tasted it.
And it's sweet.
- At what cost?
- I'm not afraid to die.
And who teaches your son when you're gone?
Lariphany?
What does she know of life as a centaur?
Maybe I shouldn't have stood up to 'em.
We should've just moved on.
You can't blame yourself for standing up for your rights.
Can't I?
Lyla would still be alive!
You did the right thing.
Sometimes, the price for that is very high.
The world is a less-than-perfect place but giving up on it won't help.
Is that what Lyla would have wanted?
Is that why she loved you?
- What do you want me to do?
- Go back turn yourself in.
And let her murder go unpunished?
How could I do that?
I know who was there.
Cletus told me before he died.
Then tell the magistrate what you know, and let justice prevail.
Deric, your son doesn't deserve the life of a fugitive.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you guys.
You have no idea how much energy a three year-old has.
I was afraid you were never coming back.
- I have to speak to Keifer for a moment.
- He's very cute, by the way.
You'll have to watch him a bit longer.
Deric and I have business in town.
- The kid doesn't even take a nap!
- Oh, Salmoneus, you'll be fine.
Remember: desire, focus, grab, hum.
Hmm.
I promise you it'll be just for a short while.
- Are you going away like Mommy?
- No.
I'll be back.
I swear to you no matter what happens to me I'll be back for you.
Give me a hug.
I'll never leave you.
I love you.
- I want my son to be safe.
- Don't worry.
- Salmoneus will keep him safe.
- He'll be safe.
I'll be a wreck.
Let's go.
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
Wh-what does a three year-old centaur eat?
- There's food in the corner.
- What if he gets a splinter?
You can handle it, Salmoneus.
Self-actualize.
Get in touch with your feminine side.
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Not potty-trained, huh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-haaa.
Mmmmmmmm, huh, if he can handle the Augean stables--
It doesn't look like everyone hates you.
Nobody's born with prejudice.
They'll get older.
They'll learn.
Or maybe someone will teach them the right things.
I have someone here to see you.
You came back?
Of your own volition?
Yes, but I didn't kill those men in cold blood.
Men?
I thought it was just Cletus.
Deric killed Merkis in the woods in self-defense I witnessed it.
And that earlier fight with Cletus?
You have witnesses to that?
No, but I know he had a part in Lyla's death.
- You have proof of that.
- He confessed to me.
- And now he's dead.
- It was an accident.
He, he tried to run away from me, and he fell down a ravine.
I'll have to hold you in custody until it can be proven one way or the other.
Custody, you mean in jail.
I don't make the laws the Athenians do that.
I merely uphold them.
Stay it'll be all right.
I'll be back.
Keifer?
Keifer?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Where could Keifer be hid-- Not there.
OK.
Keifer?
Keifer?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Oh.
Keifer?
Keifer?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
I like hide-and-seek, too, but I didn't stay hidden forever.
You know, you shouldn't play tricks on that nice man.
Mommy, you're back!
I will always be here for you always.
Keifer, please your Uncle Salmoneus isn't as young as he used to be.
- He'd really like to--
- Mommy...
Shh.
Keifer, were you talking to somebody?
Yes, that was my Mommy.
- Keifer, your Mommy is away.
- No, she's not.
She's right here.
Oh.
My mistake.
I'm sorry.
Silly man.
- What did you find out?
- Deric gave himself up.
- They're holding him in jail.
- That's a problem.
He can implicate us all.
It is a problem, but I think I have the solution.
This is wrong.
I, I don't want any part of this.
You're already a part of it.
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.
I didn't kill anybody.
I didn't even carry a torch.
That's your version.
Mine could differ, unless you do as I say.
Come on.
- But... uh...
- Shut up!
The kid's inside.
Deric, what's going on?
I just came from the Magistrate.
He said you confessed that you admitted killing Cletus in cold blood.
- I did.
- What?
We both know it's not true!
I had no choice.
They'll hang you now, you know that.
- I had no choice.
- What is that?
It's my son's toy.
They've kidnapped him.
They said if I didn't confess they'd kill him.
The scum!
They wouldn't've gotten away with it if they came at me like men instead of sneaking up while
- I was playing hide-and-seek.
- Did you recognize any of them?
Yes.
They were the same ones who attacked us outside of town and that kid who came to our campfire.
Democles?
- Any idea where they took Keifer?
- No.
They didn't seem concerned about hiding him, though.
They just wanted to make sure that Deric got his kid's toy!
Swine!
Lucky for them they outnumbered me.
I would've wiped the woods with them, huh?
Yeah, I'm sure you would have.
- Someone wants to talk to you.
- Who?
He's afraid to be seen, come to my house.
You have something to tell me?
- I was there the night Lyla died.
- What happened?
There was five of us.
We were just gonna scare them, you know?
- Centaurs and fire?
- Go on.
Things got out of hand.
Lyla knocked the torch out of someone's hand and the straw caught.
Cletus confessed before he died.
He said Merkis killed Lyla.
- I didn't know that.
- Liar.
No!
I knew she was inside when we ran to the woods
- but I didn't know she was dead.
- Then, why didn't you go back?
- The place was on fire.
- Someone was coming.
I thought that they could rescue I was afraid.
Of your pals, or the fire?
Both.
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
At least you found the courage to come forward.
Where'd they take Keifer?
- I can show you.
- No, just tell me.
You need to talk to Deric.
- To Deric, why?
- I think you know.
If I tell him what I just told you, he'll kill me.
- He's in no position to kill anyone.
- I don't think I can face him.
How can you face yourself if you don't?
What do you want?
Excuse me, but aren't you supposed to be guarding the little centaur?
- Yeah?
- Then, what's he doing outside?
Not so fast, foreigner.
You're not gonna fall for a trick like that, are you?
Here let me help.
Three guards for one little kid?
Now, don't go anywhere.
Keifer?
I can't do this.
To clear your conscience, you're gonna have to do this!
There'll be no justice!
Unless we take it in our own hands!
We have to be the law!
Oh, I don't like the look of that crowd.
Uh, we better get some help.
All right, you get the Magistrate, I'll get Hercules.
- There may not be enough time.
- Huh?
Out of the way.
What do you people think you're doing?
Get out of our way, immigrant.
I'm getting really tired of hearing that word.
Then step aside.
We've come for the centaur to give him a taste of his own justice.
Let's just calm down, and talk.
Come quietly, or your son dies.
Take him!
Wait!
He didn't murder anyone!
- He killed only in self-defense!
- Don't listen to him!
- Death by stone!
- I was there!
The centaur's wife did not die by accident.
Who cares how she died?
We don't want their kind here!
The only good centaur is a dead centaur!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Get him out here where we can see him!
Stone him!
Hercules?
- My son!
- He's safe with Lariphany.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the fun.
The centaur's crime is that he's different from you and me.
Well, then let him die.
Only, let the man who throws the first rock be someone who's not different.
Someone who's the same as everyone else.
You, no, wait, you have blue eyes.
See, most here have brown.
You!
No, you're taller than most.
No, this may be harder than I thought.
Which of you is normal, and which is different?
Don't listen to him!
He's trying to trick you!
Maybe we should start with those who have tattoos,
- and we'll stone you.
- You're an outsider.
Yes, I am but how many of you can say you've been here for two, or three, or even four generations?
- I can.
- You seem to be in the minority.
- Maybe we should start with you.
- Don't listen to him!
What are you waiting for?
Get him!
Kill him!
Stone him!
- Remember me?
- Yeah, you're that little immigrant.
Immigrant?
You bigoted piece of there's a quail on your head.
- Huh?
- Purrh, purrh, neee!
Ah!
Ooh!
How do people do that without getting headaches?
You're all right!
Well, they say you are what you eat.
You'll die for what you did to Lyla!
Deric!
Is revenge the only legacy you can pass on to Keifer?
Is there no room in his life for compassion and forgiveness?
Filthy beast!
You did the right thing.
I didn't kill your wife but I was a part of those responsible.
I was wrong and I'm sorry.
- Sorry won't bring Lyla back.
- Neither will holding onto your hate.
He's not on their side anymore.
He fought against them.
Apology accepted, friend.
Mmmmmmmmmmm.
- Say, friend, you're up early.
- Hmm?
Did you wake up saying, 'I'm not all I can be.'?
Ever hear of self-actualization?
I can teach you the secrets of Robertus Tonicles.
I can teach you how to hum.
You may think you know how to hum let me help you with that.
Mind if I travel with you for a second?
But true humming, fertilizing your flower, is a boon to mankind.
You can learn how to improve your memory and your digestion.
- I'm on my way to the market.
- Only seventeen dinars.
Hold on, friend!
- So, you've decided to stay.
- Yeah.
You were right.
Keifer is too young to be a fugitive.
We can't run forever.
I think it's a wise choice.
There are a lot of good people here, if you give them the chance to prove it.
Lyla loved this land.
I think it's what she would've wanted.
Right, Keifer?
- You miss her, don't you?
- She's right here.
Uh...
Keifer, uh, your mother's... she... she's...
I'm here.
- But... but...
- I'm real.
- But how?
- Your father, Zeus.
Oh.
He can undo the evil of man the malice of the gods he has trouble with.
He told me about your family.
I'm sorry he couldn't bring them back.
So am I. But know that they're always with me in my heart.
The only thing that could be better than that is what you have here.
Cherish it, my friends.
Thank you.
- Farewell.
- Farewell.
-Hello, Karos.
-Good morning, Lyla.
-Beautiful day, isn't it?
-So far.
That'll be two dinars.
-Two dinars.
-Ten dinars.
-You just sold it to her for two.
-Well, so, she got a deal.
You're a greedy little bigot.
And you're a centaur-loving slut.
Let's not mar a beautiful day like today with violence.
Get your filthy hands off me!
Leave me alone!
Is there a problem, Lyla?
No, no problem.
Your little wench, here was...
She's not a wench.
She's my wife... and her name is Lyla.
-Deric, don't.
-Say it!
Lyla.
Thank you.
Filthy centaurs.
We'll have to teach him a lesson.
Quiet.
Here it is.
Keifer.
Wake up.
I want you to run to a safe spot in the woods.
I'll come for you later.
-But Mommy...
-Do as I say.
Humans or centaurs, nothing instills fear like fire.
It's worse for centaurs.
It's the horse in them.
What if someone gets hurt?
We're just scaring them.
Come on!
Get out!
Get out!
No, don't!
You'll kill her!
-Here!
-Quick!
Run!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
We've got company!
Wait.
I, I think there's someone still inside.
Forget it!
Let's get out of here!
-We can't just leave her.
-Come on!
Cletus...
Lyla!
Keifer!
This is the history of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel and they plagued mankind with suffering.
Only one man dared to challenge their power:
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the Earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
Hercules!
Hercules!
My powerful, positive friend!
-Salmoneus, are you... ok?
-Couldn't be better.
Just finished a self-actualization seminar with Robertus Tonicles.
Man's a genius, makes money hand over fist.
I'll bet.
Tell me, what, exactly, is a self-actualization seminar?
It helps you... fertilize the nurturing flower within.
What's with the humming?
That's the internal harmonic, that leads you to the flower.
It helps you be.
And what is it you want to be?
I wanna be... the best possible Salmoneus I can be and I wanna teach seminars.
I wanna help others be the best possible... thing they can be...
-...for a modest price.
-I'm sure you'll do well.
Desire, focus, grab..., hum!
-Sounds like fun.
-You have no idea.
Hey, seems like we're going the same way.
Mind if I tag along?
As long as you don't hum.
I can do that.
So, where're you off to?
Athens.
Some friends of mine are having problems.
-Remember Lyla?
-That girl who went off with the centaur?
Yeah, they're finding the locals even less friendly than they were in Nespa.
Oh, dear.
Lyla.
Lyla...
Does she remind you of anyone we both know?
Come to think of it, she looks a little like Xena.
Yeah!
Different dispostion, though, huh?
This is all that's left of their house.
The fire was so hot, you could see the flames all the way into town.
Even the bodies were reduced to ashes.
What an awful way to die.
-What is this?
-I don't know.
I know.
That's the symbol of the cretans.
They're the guardians of the...
Darius!
He's just a foolish lad, full of... wild stories.
-I'd like to hear more.
-We don't know... anything.
Come, Darius, we must get home.
Deric and Lyla didn't deserve to die like this.
They were good people.
I take it you don't think the fire was an accident.
No, I don't.
Let's go find out more about these cretans.
That's an interesting tattoo.
Does it signify anything?
Yeah.
Purity and strength.
Is that so?
I saw a mark just like it over at the house that burned down.
You mean the centaur's house.
Shame about that.
Stranger, let me give you some advice.
We don't care for their kind around here.
-What kind is that?
-That should be obvious.
Just look at them.
They're not like us.
That's a relief.
You know the difference between a centaur and a three-legged dog?
People died in that fire!
I don't wanna hear any centaur jokes!
-Put him down!
-Leave him alone!
Stop!
Hasn't there been enough violence and suffering already?
!
Who are you?
My name is Lariphany.
I'm Lyla's sister.
So, you're Hercules.
Let's keep that between us for now.
I guess that's how bad things got, that Lyla came to you for help.
-I came as soon as I could.
-It's hard enough losing them that way.
But her son was barely three years old.
They had a child?
Yes, he was born while they still lived in Nespa.
One of the reasons why they left was so they could bring him up in a more accepting environment.
Burning down homes with people inside isn't exactly what I call accepting.
No one thought it would come to that.
And actually, for a while, things were fine.
Deric got work as a farm hand, Lyla took care of the house and Keifer.
-They were happy.
-What changed things?
The cretans, they started poisoning the minds of the locals.
Why don't you tell me about these cretans?
hey're a mean-spirited bunch..., ...claiming to protect the athenian purity from contamination by foreigners..., ...minorities..., anyone who's different.
-And Deric stood up to them.
-He was brave and fearless.
They hated him for that.
And none of his neighbors came to help.
The people around here are decent and hard-working but easily influenced, especially when times turn bad.
When the floods ruined the crops it was easy to blame Deric and Lyla for their troubles.
That poor child...
Jakar?
Sepsis?
They're nosing around.
They're gonna be trouble.
Well, they're really not bothering anyone.
Look, we don't like centaurs in this town and we don't like centaur-lovers.
It's that simple.
I say we give them a farewell party.
You...
I really think you should join me in the self-actualization field.
We've been through this before.
I don't want to be part of your schemes.
It's not a scheme!
It's a way to help people.
You're a hero to so many.
You could help people reach their full potential..., ...be all they could be.
-Like you...
-Exactly.
-I think we've got company.
-Good company or bad company?
I've... got a feeling it's bad.
We hope you liked your little visit to our village.
We just got here.
You're not missing much, immigrant.
I really prefer you didn't call me that.
What would you like to be called?
That's "Mister Immigrant" to you.
Well, Mister Immigrant, I'm about to brain you.
Wait!
-Why're you humming?
-I'm finding your internal flower.
It's a weed!
Centaur...!
-This way.
-Let's get him!
Yes!
Is there... some reason you're trying to slap my hand?
I saw it in an athletic contest, once!
It's a way for winners to congratulate each other.
So, why don't they just say, "Nice job." or "Congratulations."?
You need more fun in your life.
-You haven't seen the last of us.
-We can always hope.
Another round!
A mug of mead for my friend and we'll need two rooms for the night.
-Outsiders...
What do they want?
-He knows the centaur.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
Look...
We just had this discussion with your tattooed friends.
The mead and the rooms.
This is not the way to attract a convention crowd.
This is the first...
but it won't be the last!
Deric!
I will have my revenge!
Be quiet, listen!
The centaur has gone berserk.
We have to stop him before he kills again.
-That's right.
-He's turned into a monster.
He's burned his own house, and he's killed his own family.
Now, hold on.
You don't know that!
You don't know centaurs like we do.
Maybe I know them better.
I was raised and tutored by one.
The only way to protect ourselves is to track him down and kill him.
-He deserves a fair trial!
-Well, here's the magistrate.
You trust him?
Let him decide.
Wise Terseus.
We have a grave problem.
The centaur, Deric, is not dead.
He's gone mad.
He killed Cletus and then dumped the body at the roadhouse.
-That's right.
-Then he must be brought in.
-I'll need volunteers.
-If the magistrate pleases...
-...we'd like to go along.
We don't need outsiders helping us.
I only wanna make sure the fugitive is brought back alive.
So be it.
The outsider and his companion will accompany you.
As you wish, wise Terseus.
Get your weapons!
-Filthy centaur!
-Murdering beast!
This is easy, boys.
We're on his tracks!
Yeah, it's too easy.
Easy is good.
You think, you think it's a trap?
-Should I be worried?
-This way!
There he is!
Let's get him!
Looking for me?
!
Let me talk to him!
He knows me.
Deric!
It's me, Hercules!
I promise, no harm will come to you if you give yourself up!
I'm not stopping until I avenge my wife's murder!
Don't make things worse!
You've already killed a man!
It was an accident...
but he deserved to die.
Then let a court decide that!
Give up, and come back with us!
And what chance does a centaur have in a court of humans?
!
You have my word.
-No, wait!
-You murdering beast!
Soon you'll be joing your centaur-loving wife.
This is your fate too, Jakar!
I'll be back for you!
And the others!
Kill him.
Kill the monster!
Come.
This way.
Watch your back.
What are you waiting for?
Keep going!
Hercules, you don't wanna go in the swamp at night, do you?
I mean, there are bugs, and snakes, and little things that...
No, we'll make camp here.
Good choice.
Excellent choice.
Not that I wanna change your mind, but why don't you wanna go into the swamp?
'Cause we're on the wrong trail.
Centaurs don't like swamps.
Shouldn't we be on the right trail?
We have time.
I don't think he's trying to run away.
We'll pick up his track at first light.
You're back early.
Giving up so soon?
Jakar called the search off till morning.
Two men from the village drowned.
Can't see anything out there.
So, Deric's still running around free.
Thirsty?
Thanks.
You weren't with those who attacked us yesterday.
Why not?
I have no quarrel with you.
Neither did your friends, that didn't stop them.
Sometimes, they get... over-zealous.
Is that what happened at Deric's house?
I have no idea what happened at the centaur's house.
Don't you?
They're your friends.
You're not really fond of Deric, are you?
No, not really.
Look, my mother's sick.
And I can't even get hired at the farm where the centaur works...
-...'cause he does the job of three men.
-Is that Deric's fault?
He had a family to provide for, too.
Does he get the pay of three men?
Democles...
Stay away from the outsiders.
Stick to your own kind.
What's gotten into him?
Do you think he knows more about Lyla's death than he's letting on?
No question about it.
Deric's tracks?
He made a false trail leading into the swamp.
Here's the way he really went.
Shouldn't we get the others?
I'm not sure they care about bringing Deric back alive.
He probably spent the night there.
-What?
What is it?
-Interesting tracks.
What interesting?
Like bear tracks interesting?
Like lion tracks interesting?
Like crazed- centaur-ready-to-attack-us interesting?
What do you mean, interesting, huh?
Come on.
Come on?
You have nothing to worry about.
I mean, the guy's obviously deranged.
He's already killed two people.
What's to prevent him from sneaking up on us and attacking us from behind?
I don't...
I...
If you were to keep quiet. there'd be a lot less chance of him hearing us approach.
I could do that.
Thank you.
-Stay behind me.
-Good idea.
-Uh, Hercules.
No, but really...
-Quiet!
You gotta take a look at this.
Don't be afraid.
We won't hurt you.
Don't move!
Do you come as friend or foe?
What do you think, Deric?
You once spared my life.
I can never be your enemy.
It seems like we've been here before.
The last time you were blind and helpless.
And I'm still indebted to you for not killing me then.
-I gave you my reasons.
-Can I move now?
Yeah.
Your battle with Nemis has grown into legend.
-You heard how he died?
-Only that it was at your hands.
There's more to it.
His cave started collapsing on us.
He held it up until I good get Penelope and Sharos out.
I'm glad he died a good death.
He wasn't always bad.
It's never too late to put hatred and vengeance behind you.
And you want me to do that now?
I don't think Lyla would've wanted you brought back on a stake.
Come.
I'll take you to her... if your friend will look after my son.
No problem.
Hi.
My name's Salmoneus.
Do you know how to hum?
Over here.
These tracks...
They go up that way.
The centaur tricked us.
He won't get away this time.
This was her favorite place.
-I'm truly sorry.
-No more than I.
Ceridian, my mentor, told me how much centaurs fear fire.
That had to be the hardest thing you ever did...,
-...going into that burning house.
-It was never a choice.
She was dead by the time I got to her.
There was nothing I could do.
Rest in peace, my darling.
I know what you're going through.
Revenge isn't the answer.
But it is.
I've tasted it.
And it's sweet.
-At what cost?
-I'm not afraid to die.
And who teaches your son when you're gone?
Lariphany?
What does she know of life as a centaur?
Maybe I shouldn't have stood up to 'em.
We should've just moved on.
You can't blame yourself for standing up for your rights.
Can't I?
Lyla would still be alive!
You did the right thing.
Sometimes, the price for that is very high.
The world is a less-than-perfect place.
But giving up on it won't help.
Is that what Lyla would have wanted?
Is that why she loved you?
-What do you want me to do?
-Go back.
Turn yourself in.
And let her murder go unpunished?
How could I do that?
I know who was there.
Cletus told me before he died.
Then tell the magistrate what you know, and let justice prevail.
Deric, your son doesn't deserve the life of a fugitive.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you guys.
You have no idea how much energy a three year-old has.
I was afraid you were never coming back.
I have to speak to Keifer for a moment.
He's very cute, by the way.
You'll have to watch him a bit longer.
-Deric and I have business in town.
-The kid doesn't even take a nap!
Oh, Salmoneus, you'll be fine.
Remember:
desire, focus, grab..., hum.
I promise you.
It'll be just for a short while.
-Are you going away like Mommy?
-No.
I'll be back.
I swear to you... no matter what happens to me...
I'll be back for you.
Give me a hug.
I'll never leave you.
I love you.
-I want my son to be safe.
-Don't worry.
-Salmoneus will keep him safe.
-He'll be safe.
-I'll be a wreck.
-Let's go.
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
What does a three year-old centaur eat?
-There's food in the corner.
-What if he gets a splinter?
You can handle it, Salmoneus.
Self-actualize.
Get in touch with your feminine side.
Not potty-trained, huh?
!
If he can handle the Augean stables...
It doesn't look like everyone hates you.
Nobody's born with prejudice.
They'll get older.
They'll learn.
Or maybe someone will teach them the right things.
I have someone here to see you.
You came back?
Of your own volition?
Yes... but I didn't kill those men in cold blood.
Men?
I thought it was just Cletus.
Deric killed Merkis in the woods...
in self-defense.
I witnessed it.
And that earlier fight with Cletus?
You have witnesses to that?
No... but I know he had a part in Lyla's death.
You have proof of that.
-He confessed to me.
-And now he's dead.
It was an accident.
He tried to run away from me, and he fell down a ravine.
I'll have to hold you in custody until it can be proven one way or the other.
Custody...
You mean in jail.
I don't make the laws.
The athenians do that.
I merely uphold them.
Stay.
It'll be all right.
I'll be back.
Keifer?
Keifer?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Where could Keifer be hid...?
!
Not there.
Ok...
Keifer?
Keifer?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
Keifer?
Where could Keifer be hiding?
I like hide-and-seek, too, but I didn't stay hidden forever.
You know, you shouldn't play tricks on that nice man.
Mommy, you're back!
I will always be here for you.
Always.
Keifer, please..., your uncle Salmoneus isn't as young as he used to be.
He'd really like to...
Mommy...
-Keifer, were you talking to somebody?
-Yes, that was my mommy.
Keifer, your mommy is away.
No, she's not.
She's right here.
Oh.
My mistake.
-I'm sorry...
-Silly man.
-What did you find out?
-Deric gave himself up.
-They're holding him in jail.
-That's a problem.
-He can implicate us all.
-It is a problem, but...
I think I have the solution.
This is wrong.
I, I don't want any part of this.
You're already a part of it.
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.
I didn't kill anybody.
I didn't even carry a torch.
That's your version.
Mine could differ unless you do as I say.
Come on.
-But...
-Shut up!
The kid's inside.
Deric, what's going on?
I just came from the magistrate.
He said you confessed..., ...that you admitted killing Cletus in cold blood.
-I did.
-What?
-We both know it's not true!
-I had no choice.
-They'll hang you now; you know that.
-I had no choice.
What is that?
It's my son's toy.
They've kidnapped him.
They said if I didn't confess...
they'd kill him.
The scum!
They wouldn't've gotten away with it if they came at me like men instead of sneaking up while I was playing hide-and-seek.
-Did you recognize any of them?
-Yes.
They were the same ones who attacked us outside of town and that kid who came to our campfire.
Democles?
Any idea where they took Keifer?
No.
They didn't seem concerned about hiding him, though.
They just wanted to make sure that Deric got his kid's toy!
Swine!
Lucky for them they outnumbered me.
I would've wiped the woods with them, huh?
!
Yeah, I'm sure you would have.
-Someone wants to talk to you.
-Who?
He's afraid to be seen.
Come to my house.
You have something to tell me?
I was there the night Lyla died.
What happened?
There was five of us.
We were just gonna scare them, you know?
-Centaurs and fire...
-Go on.
Things got out of hand.
Lyla knocked the torch out of someone's hand... and the straw caught.
Cletus confessed before he died.
He said Merkis killed Lyla.
-I didn't know that.
-Liar.
No!
I knew she was inside when we ran to the woods...
-...but I didn't know she was dead.
-Then, why didn't you go back?
-The place was on fire.
-Someone was coming.
I thought that they could rescue...
I was afraid.
Of your pals, or the fire?
Both.
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
At least you found the courage to come forward.
Where'd they take Keifer?
-I can show you.
-No, just tell me.
-You need to talk to Deric.
-To Deric...
Why?
I think you know.
If I tell him what I just told you, he'll kill me.
He's in no position to kill anyone.
I don't think I can face him.
How can you face yourself if you don't?
What do you want?
!
Excuse me, but aren't you supposed to be guarding the little centaur?
-Yeah?
-Then, what's he doing outside?
Not so fast, foreigner.
You're not gonna fall for a trick like that, are you?
Here.
Let me help.
Three guards for one little kid?
!
Now, don't go anywhere.
I can't do this.
To clear your conscience, you're gonna have to do this!
There'll be no justice!
Unless we take it in our own hands!
We have to be the law!
Oh, I don't like the look of that crowd.
We better get some help.
All right, you get the magistrate.
I'll get Hercules.
There may not be enough time.
Let's kill him!
-Stoning is more painful!
-Out of the way.
-What do you people think you're doing?
-Get out of our way, immigrant.
I'm getting really tired of hearing that word.
Then step aside.
We've come for the centaur to give him a taste of his own justice.
-Let's just calm down, and talk.
-Move it!
This way!
Come quietly, or your son dies.
Take him!
Wait!
He didn't murder anyone!
-He killed only in self-defense!
-Don't listen to him!
-Death by stone!
-I was there!
The centaur's wife did not die by accident.
Who cares how she died?
We don't want their kind here!
Our jobs aren't safe!
Our women aren't safe!
The only good centaur is a dead centaur!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Get him out here where we can see him!
Death to the centaur!
Stone him!
Hercules?
!
-My son!
-He's safe with Lariphany.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the fun.
The centaur's crime is that he's different from you and me.
Well, then let him die.
Only, let the man who throws the first rock be someone who's not different.
-You don't live here!
-Someone who's the same as everyone else.
-Who are you to judge us?
!
-You.
No, wait, you have... blue eyes.
See, most here have brown.
You!
No, you're taller than most.
No, this may be harder than I thought.
Which of you is normal, and which is different?
Don't listen to him!
He's trying to trick you!
Maybe we should start with those who have tattoos, and we'll stone you.
-You're an outsider.
-Yes, I am.
But how many of you can say you've been here for two, or three, or even four generations?
!
-I can.
-You seem to be in the minority.
Maybe we should start with you.
Don't listen to him!
What are you waiting for?
!
Get him!
Kill him!
Stone him!
Centaur!
-Remember me?
-Yeah, you're that little immigrant.
Immigrant?
!
You bigoted piece of...
-There's a quail on your head.
-Huh?
How do people do that without getting headaches?
!
You're all right!
Well, they... say you are what you eat.
You'll die for what you did to Lyla!
Deric!
Is revenge the only legacy you can pass on to Keifer?
Is there no room in his life for compassion and forgiveness?
!
Listen to him!
Filthy beast!
You did the right thing.
I didn't kill your wife... but I was a part of those responsible.
I was wrong...
and I'm sorry.
-Sorry won't bring Lyla back.
-Neither will holding onto your hate.
He's not on their side anymore.
He fought against them.
Apology accepted..., ...friend.
Friend.
Say, friend, you're up early.
Did you wake up saying, "I'm not all I can be."?
Ever hear of self-actualization?
I can teach you the secrets of Robertus Tonicles.
I can teach you how to hum.
You may think you know how to hum.
Let me help you with that.
Mind if I travel with you for a second?
But true humming, fertilizing your flower, is a boon to mankind.
You can learn how to improve your memory and your digestion.
-I'm on my way to the market...
-Only seventeen dinars.
Hold on, friend!
So, you've decided to stay.
Yeah.
You were right.
Keifer is too young to be a fugitive.
We can't run forever.
I think it's a wise choice.
There are a lot of good people here if you... give them the chance to prove it.
Lyla loved this land.
I think it's what she would've wanted.
Right, Keifer?
You miss her, don't you?
She's right here.
Keifer, you're mother's...
She...
She's...
I'm here.
But...
But...
-I'm real.
-But, how?
Your father, Zeus.
He can undo the evil of man.
It's the malice of the gods he has trouble with.
He told me about your family.
I'm sorry he couldn't bring them back.
So am I.
But know that they're always with me... in my heart.
The only thing that could be better than that is... what you have here.
Cherish it, my friends.
Thank you.
-Farewell.
-Farewell.
Subtitles: @marlonrock1986 (^^V^^)
-Hello, Niles.
-Frasier, quick give me your museum membership card.
-What for?
-I just heard tickets go on sale today for the exhibit of fourteenth century Japanese netsuki figurines.
Oh, then the rumours were true?
Hurry, hurry, I want to get there...
-...before the line forms.
-Five seconds.
Oh, just give me a minute, Niles.
Just sit tight, huh?
And we're back.
Before we take our last call I'd like to remind you that Mercy Hospital will be conducting free blood pressure testing this Saturday on Whidbey Island.
Hypertension leads to strokes, heart disease and other maladies.
So we should all be on the lookout for symptoms like shortness of breath quickening of pulse, irritability-
Oh, will you just shove the damn thing into your mouth!
So let's all join together to help defeat this silent killer.
Roz, who is on the line?
On line four we have Mac, who's recently moved here from Australia and he's having a problem with a co-worker.
Hello, Mac, welcome to Seattle, I'm listening.
Well, mate, it like your Shelia said.
I'm working with a real yob-out.
He goes on and on about things nobody gives a billabong about just to show off how smart he is.
Well, you have my sympathy.
There's nothing more irritating than pointless and pretentious erudition.
My advice to you is to simply avoid him, is that possible?
Not really, you bloody wallaby!
You're on right before me!
Stay tuned for the Bulldog.
Well, that's one on me, or rather one on me and my call screener, Roz whose ancestors were once heard remarking "Oh, what a nice wooden horse, of course I'll sign for it."
This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health.
Gotcha!
How many times have I asked you to desist with your adolescent antics?
-I've got a sense of humour!
-I mean it, I'll go over your head!
Stop it, you're scaring me!
Listen, you sleazy little lyme tick you do that one more time and I'll cut you off.
-And I don't mean mid-sentence!
-Stop it, you're scaring me!
Do you believe these hijinks I have to put up with?
No.
Who would have thought it with a station whose current motto is, "Yakkety-Yak, We Talk Back"?
Oh, run along.
-Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.
-Miss Costas I'd like you to meet my brother, Dr. Niles Crane.
-How do you do?
-Enchanté.
I'd love to stay and chat but I'm off to get tickets...
-...for Frasier and me at the Japanese netsuki exhibit.
-You'll love it.
I saw it in Kyoto.
It's just such a shame they're not letting the really rare pieces out of the country.
As my Japanese gardener says, Maimoshi chikosho.
Watch your mouth!
Oh, you speak Japanese?
Oh, I'll just retreat so that I can be one with my humiliation.
Oh Kate, can I have a word with you?
-I'm in kind of a hurry.
-Yes, well, it'll just take a moment.
I seriously doubt that, but go ahead.
Yes, I've tried dealing with this problem on my own but Bulldog insists on interrupting my show...
-...with his foolish pranks.
-I heard.
Yes, well I did not spend eight gruelling years at Harvard to be mocked by that...
-...juvenile jackass!
-Shameless!
-Oh, he's beyond shameless!
I'm talking about the way you manage to get Harvard into every conversation.
Well, I'm sure you'll mention your alma mater too some day when it's accredited!
Gee, you sure know how to ask for help!
-No, I'm sorry.
-All right, all right.
-I know, I'll take care of it.
-Just make sure he understands that...
You went to Harvard, I know, I know.
Hey, the key to this game is the husky secondary.
Jack, how can I put this to you delicately?
You're a moron!
Shut up!
You know squat!
You know less than squat!
You and squat could go to the movies and squat could wear an "I'm With Stupid" T-Shirt!
You're awesome, Bulldog.
Way to nail a blow on Dr. Crane!
-You are the greatest!
-Yeah, whatever, shut up.
Now, look, all you guys sending in any postcards to win tickets to the SeaHawks game.
Do I need another picture of the Space Needle?
Chicks in thongs!
Enough said?
We'll be back right after this.
Hey, what I just said, I'm sorry.
I meant to say women in thongs.
-Stop busting Frasier's chops, enough said?
-Well I could, but see all these lines lit up?
They're all waiting to tell me how funny it was.
Are all these callers waiting to tell Bulldog how much they liked the joke he played on Frasier?
All except the guy on nine, he thinks Bulldog sucks.
-Because of what he did to Frasier?
-No, just in general.
-So, what do you want me to do?
-If you think I'm going to allow you to publicly mock one of our most respected hosts on air just for the sake of higher ratings you and I are going to get along just fine!
Come on, Eddie, you love paté.
And this is the good stuff.
-Uh-oh.
-Two syllables every homeowner loves to hear upon entering the door.
Would that have anything to do with the fact that you're feeding my imported foie gras to a dog?
Well, I'm sorry, but it calms him during the thunder.
Oh, well, heaven forbid that Eddie should ever work a nerve!
When Niles gets here we'll have sherry and snausages!
That reminds me, Dr. Crane will be a bit late.
Your father asked him to stop at the vet and pick up some pills for Eddie.
I'm the one who's had a hard day.
How come no one ever brings me tranquilizers?
I've often wondered that myself.
-Hello?
-Hello, this is Dr. Julius Irving.
I'm calling for Dr. Niles Crane his receptionist said he might be there.
I'm sorry, I am expecting him if you'd like to leave a message.
No, no, nothing important.
Some of the boys here at the club have a little bet going about "The Mikado."
Well, perhaps I can help.
I'm Niles's brother Dr. Frasier Crane, and as luck would have it I was in an all-male version of "The Mikado" at Oxford.
People still ask to see my Yum-Yum.
I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to "Three Little Maids"?
Well, let me see.
Well, of course my falsetto isn't what it used to be but, um...
Dad, would you please be quiet?
-I'm trying to settle a bet here.
-You sure are!
Some caller bet Bulldog he couldn't make you sing over the air.
Sayonara, Doc!
Well, Dad, I'm glad to see that you're amused having your own son humiliated publicly.
Oh, come on, it's funny.
He makes everybody look stupid the guys in the newsroom, Chopper Dave...
That is not exactly a miracle transformation when it comes to Chopper Dave.
A man whose life work consists of looking down at the freeway and saying, "Crowded"; "Not Crowded."
-Where are you going?
-To the station!
Oh, come on, Frasier, don't take it all so seriously.
You know, we played jokes like this all the time when I was on the force.
The day they replaced my bulletproof vest with a big lacy bra I knew I was one of the guys.
Thank you, Dad.
That also clears up a question that's troubled me for years concerning the night you were shot!
The "Salmon" that's what you want to name our expansion hockey team, "The Seattle Salmon"?
!
Why don't you take your two IQ points, rub them together see if you can't start a fire, beat it!
-Hey, you're in the doghouse!
-Hey, am I on?
Yes, take as long as you want!
Hey, Bulldog, you're the man.
How about we name them "The Bulldogs"?
Hey, you want to suck up?
Send money!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I got another one.
-What about "The Lizards"?
-I hate lizards, they're disgusting.
They make my skin crawl.
You're an idiot...
-...and you don't deserve to live!
-You're the best, Bulldog!
Shut up!
Back in thirty!
-I warned you.
-Hey, hey, clear your jets.
Kate told me to keep busting ya'.
Said it's good for ratings.
You got a beef, take it up with her!
-I don't believe you.
-Pete, what did Kate say?
-She said you're a pig.
-No, before that!
She said keep ragging' on the doc'!
-I want to talk to Kate now!
-She's not in.
-Oh, very clever.
"She's not in." Like that'll make me go away!
She's not in!
I need a copy of our contract with Nanette Stewart.
What's Yum-Yum doing here?
It's all right, I can guess.
You promised you'd put an end to Bulldog's shenanigans and instead you encouraged him.
You're cancelling "Pet Chat With Nanette"?
!
She's been on for six years.
Yeah, but she's been floating at the top of the bowl for the last two.
When I went in to talk to Bulldog the phones were lit up like Times Square.
His fans love it when he zaps you.
-So, you would have me ridiculed for the sake of those hyenas!
-No.
I would have you fight back.
He makes pot shots at you, you come back at him in your droll, Ivy League, "look at me I've got a thesaurus" kind of way!
-It'll be funny!
-Funny?
!
Funny!
?
I refuse to engage in a battle of wits with a man who's favourite t-shirt reads "Seattle Hooter Inspector"!
-Afraid of the competition?
-I am a doctor, I went to medical school!
I will not embarrass myself by engaging in a grab for ratings.
You just announced to a half a million listeners that you are "filled to the brim with girlish glee."
I think the H.M.S Pinafore of embarrassment has sailed!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to fire someone.
Oh, God, she brought Spanky!
Kate, this is not over!
Do you know what your problem is?
You have no sense of humour.
-I am sick and tired of people telling me that!
-Well, then, lighten up.
I asked the Raiders' defensive line to describe their tackling skills and here's what they said.
Good evening, Daphne.
-Evening, Dr. Crane.
-Did you bring Eddie's pills?
-Yes.
And the vet gave very specific instructions.
"Take one tablet per hour or as needed until trembling subsides."
I'm sorry, these are for Maris.
Those are for Eddie, here you go.
I'll just hide his pill in a bit of food.
Like our Grammy Moon used to get grandad to take his heart medicine.
If he had heart problems, why wouldn't he want to take his medicine?
Don't think that nosy coroner didn't ask the same question!
Num-nums, Eddie.
Oh, he's a good boy.
Normally I don't believe in popping pills for every little upset.
I quite agree!
My nerves are bothered by this constant thundering, too but I would never turn to drugs to calm down.
Oh, mommy!
Hey Niles, you're not going to believe what happened to Frasier.
-Oh, I heard the whole thing.
-You listen to Bulldog's program?
Yes, Dad, I can't sleep nights till I find out who hurled what ball through what apparatus.
No, no, no, no, it was on at the vet's.
You would think that in a city with this much rain that people would develop an etiquette about it, but no!
They buy umbrellas that are too big for them you have to walk into the street to get around them and then they drive too close to the curb so that you're sure to get splashed!
And they wear brown shoes with white socks!
What has that got to do with the rain?
Nothing!
But I mean, really, get a fashion sense!
-Well, I guess things didn't go too well at the station, huh?
No, they didn't.
It turned out the station manager is encouraging Bulldog's little pranks.
Now she wants me to return his fire on the air.
Well, I thought the idea was absurd at first but now I'm starting to warm to it.
I say have at him!
He's grossly overmatched but he did bring this on himself.
You know, you're right, Niles.
If I have to fight cheap and dirty on his own turf, then I will!
-And what is that supposed to mean?
-Well, I don't think it's a good idea.
You know, Bulldog's pretty good at this kind of thing.
-He's a funny guy.
-And, I'm not funny?
-I don't believe this!
-Well, now, obviously Dad's forgetting the time you took the names of our wine club board and turned them all into wickedly derisive anagrams!
"Sidney Ass Basket"!
-Now, you see, dad, I made you laugh.
-No, I'm looking at Eddie.
I guess he won't be needing a second pill!
Now, now, Frasier, don't get me wrong.
I think you're witty, you're clever but funny's different.
Funny's somebody who makes you laugh with your belly.
Now, Bulldog's funny.
Duke's cousin, Louie, now he's really funny!
He's like Jackie Gleason, only loud!
He makes you laugh so hard the beer comes out of your nose.
You know what feels good through the nose?
A warm cup of cocoa.
I just may go home for Christmas this year.
You know, just because I haven't caused anyone to blow beer through their nostrils doesn't mean that I can't.
Anyone who can compose a clever ballad can certainly master the intricacies of the whoopee cushion!
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
It's a lot harder than you think.
All right, you just tune into Bulldog's show tomorrow.
Pop open a beer and prepare for a Budweiser geyser!
You know, Frasier, if you're serious about that whoopee cushion I happen to have one at the house.
Last year a disgruntled servant left one on Maris's dining room chair.
Fortunately for all of us, embarrassment was averted when my little faun proved too light to activate it.
Well, it's six-thirty, sports fans.
That means it's time for our big SeaHawks tickets giveaway.
Yes, my curvaceous and bodacious assistant Darlene is rolling in our glittery giant prize draw right now.
Okay, Darlene, give it a good crank.
Whoa!
Honey, I meant the drum!
Here it comes, Roz, the hilarity ensues!
Okay, explain this to me one more time.
You were the one who's trying to prove to everyone you're so funny, so why am I the one who had to put the lizard in the box?
!
It was just as difficult to be the lookout!
Stop whining!
Hey, look who's here.
It's our new boss lady, KACL's own Kate Costas!
-Kate's there?
Oh, Frasier, Kate's there!
No, no, it's even better.
Even better that she will be an eyewitness to my little jape!
Come in, Kate.
-Yeah, here we go, glad you dropped in.
-Hello, Bulldog.
Hi, Darlene.
Wow, look at that mighty drum!
Yeah, give it a good spin!
Look at those cards going round and round.
Okay, Seattle and the winner is...
-Hey, Kate, why don't you pick it?
-Okay.
And the lucky winner is...
-Something bit me!
-Oh my God!
It's a lizard!
-Man, it's got your fingertip
-Oh, God!
-I'll get some ice.
There it goes, there it goes, there it goes!
Stop that lizard, it has my finger!
Roz!
Any news?
-Oh, yeah.
They sewed her fingertip back on.
She's gonna be fine.
Frasier, would you wipe that guilty look off your face?
-No-one even suspects you.
-Why not?
Because you made such a big deal about how playing pranks was beneath you!
Oh, they're not only beneath me, they're beyond me.
I'm going to accept my limitations and be satisfied to merely be witty and urbane.
Even my most barbed comments never drew blood!
-Oh God, I feel sick.
-You do?
When the lizard threw up her fingertip who had to pack it in frozen yogurt and rush it down here?
!
-I'm going to tell her the truth.
-What?
!
Are you insane?
I've got to unburden myself.
Frasier, you didn't start this.
You are the victim here.
Why should you have to suffer any more than you already have?
-I'll keep your name out of it!
-Fine, do what you want.
I don't know when I'll be back in the office, Susan.
Just cancel all my appointments.
Is there any word on who pulled this stupid stunt?
I don't want excuses, I want names!
Will you hurry up that shot.
-I'm in agony here.
-Kate...
I see that your strength is back.
I brought you some flowers.
What kind of raving psychotic...
-...would do a thing like this?
-You know people use that word "psychotic" an awful lot these days.
A kid steals a candy bar, suddenly he's a psychotic.
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna crush him!
Are you sure that's enough?
Make sure that all goes in!
Call me if you need anything.
Well, Kate, I came here for a reason.
Oh, let me guess, someone park in your space?
No, but if someone had, I would have forgiven him...
-...just as I'm sure you will forgive...
-Who?
Well, I'm sure the poor misguided prankster that perpetrated this evil deed really had no ill will in mind.
It wasn't his... or her...
You know that Nanette from "Pet Chat" she had a real axe to grind!
-What?
-What?
-You giggled.
-Oh, it was kinda funny.
-What?
-What?
-What's funny?
-Oh, I was just remembering...
-What?
-What?
Oh, oh, the shot's kicking in, isn't it?
Wouldn't you know, it bites my middle finger.
How am I supposed to drive?
You know, Kate, maybe now would be a good time...
Now you know, life is so funny.
One minute, you're standing in a hallway the next minute you're a poo-poo platter for a lizard.
That's a funny word, isn't it?
Hallway!
-You want to hear something really funny?
-And Bulldog...
Bulldog's...
Oh, see, now, you're starting to get tired, I should go.
Kate, Kate, before you go to sleep there's just one last funny thing I want to tell you...
O-kay!
-I put the lizard in the box.
-O-kay.
Oh, God!
-It's alive!
-You what?
Well, I, it was meant for Bulldog.
It was all an accident, I never intended to...
Kate?
Kate?
Nurse!
You know, I never considered myself an environmentalist, but the idea of somebody free-dumping biomass is really starting to tick me off.
I mean, we're looking at a two and a half acre crop loss if Sea Mine doesn't stop dumping by-product.
Yeah, well, we don't know it's Sea Mine, do we?
Yeah, and we don't know there is no Santa Claus, either.
Hate it when I'm right.
Yeah.
The old man's gonna freak.
(RUMBLING)
What the hell was that?
You...
You don't suppose they had the nerve to dump while we're here, do you?
God, I hope so.
(RADAR BEEPING)
Where are you going?
We're gonna catch these guys red-handed.
Look.
They're circling back.
Now maybe the UEO will get off their butts and do something.
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Turn around, Jenna.
Turn around.
What the hell is that?
Jenna?
Jenna!
Jenna!
Jenna!
(BEEPS)
(PANTING)
ORTIZ ON PA:
Commander Ford, you have a call.
Commander?
Jonathan?
Something wrong?
Must be doing extra laps.
Commander, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you have an up-link on hold.
Take a message.
I tried that, sir.
Well, try again.
Jonathan, it's your father.
I know.
He's been on hold a while.
Sir?
What?
Okay.
The Fitness Center?
No, my quarters.
Secured line.
A secured line with his dad?
They have a special relationship.
I guess.
Hello, sir?
Mr. Ford, I can put you through now.
Sir?
Sir?
Mr. Ford?
Nice.
Hello?
Anybody there on that nice sandy beach?
You waiting for somebody?
Where's my son?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I asked you first.
I got it, Tony.
Commander Ford, do you know this guy?
Jonathan, who is this person?
Person?
Goodbye, Tony.
Dagwood, put this back where you got it.
Shame on you.
Where did I get it?
CHARLES:
Rick and Jenna are missing.
The bodies were never recovered.
When did this happen?
Yesterday afternoon.
How's Ben taking it?
Your brother's a mess.
Rick and Jenna were good friends.
Dad...
I just don't think I can get away right now.
Jonathan, you know I wouldn't call if I didn't need you.
I'd handle it myself, but this new facility has all my attention.
I've got half the business leveraged into this start-up.
I can't lose focus.
What about Ben?
He's your chief operating officer.
If I came down there I'd be stepping all over his toes.
He and Mike Rainer hate each other.
Like throwing fuel on the fire.
This thing with Sea Mine South Atlantic has turned into a full-blown range war.
Mike Rainer likes you.
You're a big shot in the Navy.
No, Dad, the UEO has got to stay neutral.
Jonathan, I'm not asking you down here in your professional capacity.
I'm asking you as my son.
Look, you made it perfectly clear to me a long time ago that my life's work is not important to you.
Dad.
That is a much larger conversation.
Then let's not have it.
Give me a couple of days.
That's all I'm asking.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Just don't let this get any uglier, Ben.
It's pretty ugly already.
I may not have Jonathan's finesse, but Rainer and his Sea Mine goons are diggers, and a cool head to them just makes an easier target.
Look, Dad, give me 24 hours, I'll have Sea Mine on their knees.
If you think I'm going to give you permission to retaliate, you're dead wrong, Ben.
Dad...
No!
Now, I don't want you doing anything until Jonathan gets here.
Do you understand me?
LUCAS:
The pattern of ice pack breakdown is consistent.
BRIDGER:
You're sure it's just not a minor coastal disturbance?
No, no, there's definitely a trackable pattern, and this is nothing minor.
The emergence of farming and mining in the area have completely altered the natural ecology.
Activity which has caused the water's temperature to rise.
There's still a ceiling of cold water running through it, though, right?
No, see, that's the problem.
It's forcing warm water deeper along the trench, blowing it right back through our interior ice pack.
Those idiots in the farming and mining industries are destroying our ice caps.
Well, that's the price of progress, Lucas.
The gains of providing affordable food and mineral products to the world outweigh the seasonal anomalies of a single ice floe.
Besides, both industries are sanctioned by the UEO.
You know that logo at the top of your paycheck?
Captain, with your permission, I need to take a few days off.
Is this your father's business?
You know, the natural resources of the world belong to everyone.
Aqua farming and mining are signatories to the UEO Natural Resources Act.
We're supposed to stay neutral.
I understand that, sir.
But by staying neutral, the UEO is only fueling an explosive situation, a situation that's cost my father millions, as well as the lives of two of his research workers.
Maybe you should be there.
Permission granted.
Thank you, sir.
Oh!
Sorry.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you going somewhere, Commander Ford?
I have to go see my family, Dagwood.
You have to go see your family?
You don't want to go see your family?
Sometimes.
But not this time?
I just don't always get along with them, is what I mean, Dagwood.
You don't like your family?
No, no, no, I love my family.
It's just easier to love them from far away.
It's like when you go to a restaurant.
Going to families is like going to a restaurant?
No, no, that's not what I mean.
I mean, we tend to be nicer to total strangers.
You know, friends, waiters.
We tend to behave better, we have more patience, we don't drive them to distraction.
You know, familiarity breeds contempt.
None of this means anything to you, does it?
The part about the restaurant does.
A little.
I like restaurants.
I guess we're just more at ease showing our bad side to people who have to love us.
It's complicated.
No.
I get it.
We have family because we have to drive them to distraction, where there is a restaurant that we go to to be nice to people who don't have to love us.
Exactly.
(CHUCKLING)
COMPUTER VOICE:
Mag-Lev engaged.
Be seated to avoid injury.
Thank you, Commander Ford.
Next stop, Docking Bay 2.
Anytime, Dagwood.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
I don't know, Ben.
It doesn't sound like something your father would go for.
We have to take care of ourselves, Paulie.
Nobody understands that better than my father.
FORD:
Hey, Paulie!
Iced tea over here.
Hey!
Jonathan, when'd you get here?
I just got here.
Good to see you, man.
Sit down.
Finish your dinner.
Thanks.
How's your mom?
She's good, she's good.
I'll tell her you asked.
Let me get you another one of these.
Ben?
I'm fine.
Paulie's on aerators tonight.
He's gotta go.
Since when do we run at night?
Since you've been gone.
Paulie.
Yeah.
Another time.
Okay.
Look, Ben, this wasn't my idea.
It's okay, Jon, I understand.
It's not like it matters.
Well, it matters to me.
I just don't know what to do about it.
I mean, you and Dad are entitled to your own relationship, even one that sucks.
I just don't see why ours has to suck, too.
You're not around that much.
Well, maybe I can do something about that.
No, Jon, you're not around that much.
So what difference does it make how we get along?
And so far as the old man seeing you as the only answer to the problems he can't solve...
Well, I can't do much about that.
I make good decisions when I'm allowed to, Jon, and I can be very effective.
Thank you.
DARWIN:
Dying.
Dying?
Who's dying.
Sea lions, schools, many dolphins.
He's been like this all morning.
What is it, my friend, huh?
A predator?
An orca?
Bigger than orca.
Bigger?
An eating mammal?
Eating fish.
Scaring dolphin.
Okay, where is this big fish, Darwin?
Near land.
Warm water.
Comes from cold water.
Likes warm now.
You know, maybe that activity in the South Atlantic has stirred up a pod of killer whales.
But he says it's not killer whales.
So what is it?
CHARLES:
Missing?
What the hell's Paulie doing out there in the middle of the night running aerators?
I thought that with all that's been going on, we should be running nighttime back-ups.
With all that's been going on, we should be staying the hell in our homes at night.
Paulie's got a family.
Yeah, we know how important family is to you.
I've been on with the Coast Guard all morning.
I gave them a full description of the launch and the aerator grid.
But so far there's no sign of Paulie or the boat.
Dad,
Ben was just trying to do his job.
I can handle this, Jon.
MAN:
Mr. Ford, there's a call from Mike Rainer here for you.
Mr. Ford?
Yeah?
Mr. Rainer?
Your father around, Jon?
I've found something I believe belongs to you.
You want to send someone to get it?
Looks like chop slammed it against the struts all night.
That still wouldn't account for this.
I don't know what did this.
I'm sure you don't.
Hey, junior, maybe you ought to tell me why you had a man at my rig in the middle of the night.
Don't try and turn this around on me, Rainer!
I'm not turning nothing around.
Guys, guys.
Look, I'm totally clean on this, Jon.
I had nothing to do with any of your father's accidents.
Nothing.
Now, maybe some of my guys off-loaded a little waste before they got completely outside the shelf.
But sabotage?
Not while I'm in charge.
Look, maybe you got a loose cannon on your hands you don't know about.
Well...
We know for sure your father has one.
And whatever sabotage you think we're responsible for doesn't justify this.
This explosive was strapped to the strut of my rig.
Thank God it hadn't been set yet.
Now, I'm willing to let this go, Commander, but you tell your old man no more of this bull, or I promise, it will get ugly.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
Jon, wait.
You know, at least, if you're gonna do something that stupid, have the guts to do it yourself.
You gonna tell Dad?
No, I'm not gonna tell Dad.
You're gonna tell Dad, right after you tell Paulie's mom.
Rainer's not behind the attacks, Dad.
He's been dumping biomass in my beds.
Why should I believe this man?
MAN:
Mr. Ford, you wanna have a look at this?
Mike Rainer may not be the planet's best friend, but he knows the difference between cutting corners and the cost of human life.
Look, I didn't come down here to take sides.
I've done all I can.
I've really gotta get back to seaQuest.
Dad?
(RO ARING ON CAMERA)
Jonathan!
Where are you?
I don't know, but I'm about three miles west if you're heading towards the Trench.
Why?
You gotta run, son!
You gotta run as fast and as hard as you can, and don't slow down!
Run?
Run from what?
Dad?
Dad!
Run to the kelp beds, son!
What?
Hide in the kelp!
Now!
Oh, my God!
(ROARING)
Dad, that's the biggest alligator I've ever seen in my life.
It's a crocodile, Jon.
Now, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Dad, I can't stay here.
It's gonna take the top off.
Jonathan, there's a filtration system about 60 feet to your starboard.
When I tell you to,
I want you to make as wide a sweep away from it as you can, and make a run for the beach!
I'll never make it.
At a dead start I need 15 seconds just to get from one end of that thing to another.
You can make it, son.
Because in five seconds, I'm gonna blow up the filtration tanks and release 40,000 gallons worth of fertile seed flagellate.
Plankton?
A 200-foot crocodile is trying to eat me, and you want to attack it with spores?
Now, Jonathan!
Now!
He's going for it.
(PANTING)
Captain, this is Commander Ford.
I think the situation in the South Atlantic officially falls under the auspices of the seaQuest.
Let's get you out.
LUCAS:
Well, the tracking and depth sensors are totally shot.
The internal ballast system has to be completely refit, but she'll live to sail again.
Lucas, I take back everything I ever said to you about the cost of titanium siding.
A quarter of an inch is all that stood between me and being that thing's lunch.
Come on, Commander, a 200-foot crocodile?
You know how everything underwater looks a little larger than life.
Jonathan, it's not unusual for some species of salt water crocodile to grow in excess of 30 feet.
No, no, no.
Guys, guys.
His head was 30 feet.
I know what I saw.
Dad, anytime you want to pipe in.
170, anyway.
Well, if it's as big as you say it was, then what you probably saw was this.
A lizard.
Yeah, it's a very big lizard.
It's a Deinosuchus.
It's a post-Jurassic predecessor of the modern crocodile and alligator.
That's what I saw.
That's it.
That's what's been terrorizing us.
This isn't Ben's fault.
Get out of here.
That thing, out there where I swim?
It's just a theory.
How would a creature like that survive today?
Well, with the activity in the South Atlantic and the rising temperature,
I'd say we probably thawed this thing out of a million-year-old block of ice.
DAGWOOD:
The lizard got hurt.
One of you science-heads ought to have a field day with this.
What is that?
Piece of Wally gator.
Captain, if one of these things has been reanimated after 100 million years,
there could be more.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Scatter-Com away, bearing 298.
Miguel?
ORTIZ:
Recording at 2,000 meters.
No frequency backwash.
Clean?
As a whistle.
Okay.
I got final.
Final is good to go.
Captain, I'm reporting a final on all marine activity in the region.
I'm uplinking your board now.
Thank you, O'Neill.
Well, except for the usual pods of migrating marine life, Captain,
I'd say we're talking about an isolated case.
Good.
Well, sort of good.
I mean, there's still at least one of those things out there we've gotta take care of.
We can't kill it.
Look, this thing is amazing.
What's amazing, Lucas, is its appetite.
Ask Darwin how he feels about it.
Captain?
We're lucky it hasn't destroyed an entire village.
SMITH:
Which is not to say it won't.
Area of attacks have been fairly contained.
Cold-blooded reptiles tend to be territorial as long as there's food in the area.
Well, there's not much we can do about the marine population, but we can evacuate the human population.
You mean the villagers.
I mean everyone.
For how long?
For as long as it takes.
This area is a vital piece of my operation, Captain.
I paid a fortune for these rights.
Millions in research, and millions more in manpower and equipment.
Fine.
You tell the bank I'm defaulting on my loan because of a 200-foot crocodile.
Well, 170 anyway.
MAN ON PA:
Evactee Provo is cleared for departure at Dock 2.
Evactee Provo is cleared for departure at Dock 2.
MAN 1:
Get those cargo sleds now.
MAN 2:
Yes, sir.
MAN 3:
Hold that line.
Clear this area right now.
Everything all right?
Yeah, everything's cool.
Thanks a lot, man.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
We're clear all the way up to the cove, Commander.
I've got flyers out to all the locals.
Everyone seems to be taking the evacuation in stride.
Good.
Listen, why don't you take the shuttle back up to the docks with everybody else, help keep a lid on things up there?
I gotta tell you, Commander, it's a pretty impressive little empire your family's got here.
Just how rich are you?
Well, that's a pretty rude question.
I got a ruder one.
Oh.
If you're so rich, how come you keep working?
Because I like ordering guys like you around.
Now, move it.
Don't take it so hard, Dad.
With any luck, in a few weeks you'll be back in full operation.
That's not what I was thinking.
I came very close to losing you.
The hardest fate to imagine is losing a child.
Well, you'd still have Ben.
I take it that's your way of telling me that I should stop being such a jerk to your brother.
No, sir, I would never dream of telling you what to do.
Then I guess that's your way of telling me also that while I'm at it, I could stop being such a jerk to you.
Very funny.
Thanks.
You know what else is funny?
You coming all the way down here to help me keep going.
Now you're shutting me down.
Come on.
You and Ben can ride back with me in the launch.
Fine.
What the hell is this?
MAN:
Hey, we're getting ready to roll here.
Need some help?
Yeah, sure, man.
Thanks a lot.
You know, I think I may owe you an apology.
Oh, not as far as I can see.
I probably owe you one.
At least one.
Which one are you talking about?
Oh, you know.
The one where I dumped this gig in your lap, stuck you with the old man's dream.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, that one.
(RUMBLING)
You know,
I didn't stick around because I didn't know what else to do with my life.
I stayed because I actually like agricultural work.
You have got to be kidding.
And given half the chance, I know I can do it better than Dad.
Did you ever tell Dad this?
What, you think I'm crazy?
Dad.
(ROARING)
Don't move, son.
Hey!
Hey!
Here, you miserable lizard!
No, Ben!
No!
Come and get me, you oversized handbag!
Dad?
Stupid kid.
Come on!
My God!
Dad, he's got Ben!
BEN:
Dad!
Down here!
Help!
Help!
FORD:
Crocodile eggs.
Any sign of our crocodile?
No, sir, nothing yet.
Nothing at all.
What do you mean?
Well, the shelf is usually teeming with jack, yellowtail, schools of tuna, but it's completely dead out there.
It's been that way all morning.
How many eggs were down there?
I didn't hang around long enough to count, but I'd say a dozen, maybe more.
That was a stupid thing you did, Ben.
Getting that thing to go after you.
You're welcome.
You missed a golden opportunity.
With me out of your life, you could've run the business any way you wanted.
I don't want you out of my life, Dad.
Just out of the way.
(CHARLES AND BEN LAUGHING)
(GROANING) Dagwood.
(CHOKING) Dagwood.
Dagwood, no.
(COUGHING) Dag...
Dag...
Okay, okay.
Thanks.
Welcome.
Sir, a UEO reconnaissance plane spotted our crocodile.
Where?
She's sunning herself.
(SNORING)
BRIDGER:
Sunning herself?
Well, she's standing guard over her nest.
LUCAS:
What are we gonna do?
I hate to think what'll happen if some of those eggs hatch and these things start swimming out to the open waters.
Well, I've got good news and bad news.
According to the DNA found in that reptile's skin, our crocodile was, and is again, a healthy three-and-a-half year old.
Three years old?
Doctor, the life expectancy of the Deinosuchus was 120 years.
They were known to lay eggs several times a year, every year for the entire course of their lives.
And that wasn't the good news?
She's sterile.
Is or was?
Always has been, according to her blood grouping.
So those eggs are infertile.
Mmm-hmm.
That poor thing is standing defense for babies that will never be born.
So what happens to Mom?
I don't see that we have a choice.
I mean, as healthy as she is, with her longevity, she's gonna wreak some pretty major havoc on our food chain.
We've gotta kill her.
No.
You can't kill her.
Put her back.
Dagwood, I wish it was that simple.
It is.
Put her back where we got her.
Where did we get her?
Wait a minute.
He's right.
We just put her back.
How are you gonna get her back 100 million years?
That's not where she's from anymore.
She really came from the ice floe.
Well, we do have enough liquid nitrogen on the boat to put her back to sleep.
Re-freeze her?
It's the most humane way, Commander.
We gotta first get her off the island.
(CLICKING)
ORTIZ:
Darwin's got her, sir.
WSKRS?
Bodyguards in position, sir.
Come on, my friend.
Don't take chances.
Sir, we've lost the crocodile.
Where'd she go?
Where's Darwin?
(CLICKING)
Darwin's fine, sir.
Keep a WSKR on her, Lieutenant.
Don't let her get too far from the boat.
Aye, aye, sir.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Stay close.
Ready the hatch.
Ready, sir.
Darwin's inside, sir.
Good.
You ready, Mr. Ortiz?
On your order, sir.
Okay.
Now.
Got her, sir.
Vital signs slowing down, heart rate, temperature.
All activities in stasis.
She's asleep, sir.
Any time, Lieutenant.
Aye, aye, sir.
She's secured, sir.
Thank you, Commander.
Take us through the Drake Passage.
065.
Let's put her to bed.
Maybe some day she'll come back.
Maybe she will.
We're ready, Lieutenant.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Dr. Smith said it might smell for a few days, but the mineral output you'll get when those eggs rot should be worth it.
Sorry, I had to thaw 100 million year crocodile out to get you to come visit.
Oh, you knew I was gonna show up eventually.
Somebody's gotta pull you two apart from time to time.
(LAUGHING)
Well, I guess I'll say goodbye to you now.
Goodbye?
Where you going?
Nepal.
Nepal?
Well, what's in Nepal?
I don't know.
I've never been there.
What?
I'm taking a year off, Jon.
Giving Ben the chance to find out what he can do without me.
That's great.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Congratulations to both of you.
You take care of yourself, son.
I will.
All right, man.
You're gonna do great.
(CHILDREN CLAMORING)
BOY:
Throw it back, please.
Please, throw it back, please.
Yo, sir.
Bring it back, please.
Hi, I'm Rosalind Allen.
We all know Darwin is a dolphin, but do you know what separates him from his relative, the porpoise?
Well, one difference is their rostrums or noses.
A dolphin's rostrums are elongated and beak-like, while a porpoise's is shorter and more blunt.
Their teeth are also different.
A dolphin's are conical, while a porpoise's are shaped like spades.
Generally, porpoises are found in colder waters, while dolphins are a familiar sight along the warmer waters of our coast lines.
See you on the next adventure of seaQuest.
So, Gracie, are you excited about your play date with Willie?
I think Willie just wants me for my toys.
Oh, sweetie, you might as well get used to it.
You're going to be guarding your toys for the rest of your life.
Well, we're off.
First game of the Broadway Show League.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, don't you look adorable.
You know, I don't think I've ever seen you in jeans before.
Wait a minute.
Turn around.
I think you got a rip.
No, no.
Looking good.
Let's get going, Dad.
I want to warm up before we play.
Oh, what's your rush.
I've been to those games.
Whose idea was it to have Nell Carter try and beat out a bunt?
Fran, we're playing against "Children of a Lesser God."
Their hand signals are awesome.
So's the guy on first base. / Ohhhhh.
Oh, give it up, Maggie.
They're deaf, not blind.
Here.
What's this hand signal mean?
/ Ouch!
Well, Brighten's playing sports, and I accept tips.
Please, the only reason he's on the team is a chance to see Margaret trying to run.
Oh, now, don't you go making fun.
I've seen you break into a trot.
You got a little "Nutty Professor" thing happening yourself
Yeah, well, all right.
Time to play ball.
Bye, sweetheart.
Have fun.
Oh, you're talking to Grace.
Master Willie is here with his nanny.
Oh, now, honey, you go make an entrance and check yourself like I taught you.
I'm fine.
Miss Fine, you might want to dressed for this particular nanny.
Oh, why?
What?
Is she all snazzed up?
One of those Park Avenue nannies with way too much time on her hands?
Oh, look, "Planet of the Apes" is on at 4:00.
Hi, I'm Kurt, Willie's nanny.
Oh, hi, I'm Fran.
How you doing?
/ Good.
Okay if I use the phone?
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Just pick up Line 2.
I'm on Line 1 with my mother.
Uh-huh ...
What are you doing?
Oh, I thought there might be something wrong with your eyes.
A handsome man just walked through the door and you didn't do your usual subtle Hanna-Barbara reaction -- heart pounding through your thorax, tongue unfurrowing and landing on the floor.
Niles, please, the man's gay.
Now, how do you know that?
You barely spoke two words to each other?
Well, first of all, I was instantly attracted to him, which means he's definitely unavailable.
Plus, did you see that upper body?
Trust me.
He's either gay or a priest with a solar plexus.
Miss Fine, you're mad.
/ Oh, yeah?
All right.
Well, watch this, Mr. Know-It-All.
Kurt, who understudied Carol Channing in "Dolly"?
Joanne Worley. / Hello ...
I can never get Willie to take a nap.
You're amazing.
I'm telling you, turkey makes you tired.
Why do you think they serve it at Thanksgiving?
How else can you spend eight hours with your entire family unless half of them pass out?
Oh, what I wouldn't give for Jimmy Smith's body. / Hey, you and me both.
Meanwhile, I watch and watch, the only one taking a shower is Dennis Franz.
Do you believe David Carruso left that show?
/ Oh, actors, huh?
I'm an actor.
/ Smart, very smart.
Is it okay if I use the phone again?
My agent asked me to call him.
Oh, absolutely.
Maybe you got a job?
/ No.
He's just a sadist.
But, then, I'm addicted to rejection, so we both get a kick.
Oh look who's home.
How'd the game go?
That depends if you're on our team or theirs.
Maxwell, it wasn't my fault.
I couldn't understand your signals.
Cee Cee, how many things can this mean?
Run!
Next time try yelling "last call."
Oh, Niles, dear-sweet-I-manage- your-pension-plan
- Niles ...
May I get you some tea?
You know, I don't mind that we lost.
I mean, at least I made it to first base.
You never even made it out of the dugout.
/ I know.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, Mr. Sheffield, wait a minute.
I think you got some grass stains there.
No, no.
Looking good.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield ...
Kurt Jacobs.
I was the understudy in your production of "Equist."
Oh, Kurt, yes, of course.
I didn't recognize you without the big horse head.
Hello, Kurt.
Remember me?
Cee Cee Babcock?
No.
I'm the producer who hired you?
/ Oh, right, right, right.
You, ah, you cut your hair.
Hey, it looks really fabulous --
Knock it off, Kurt.
So, how are you?
Are you working?
Yes.
I'm a nanny.
/ Oh, how awful for you.
Ohhh ...
Oh, for a minute there, I almost took that the wrong way.
So, Kurt, you're a nanny, huh?
Well, that's wonderful.
You know, children are our greatest resource.
Daddy .../ Not now, Margaret.
I'm talking to our guest.
Well, it's been nice talking to you.
/ Okay.
So, come on, you want to watch a little of "All My Children"?
Gee, I hope it was okay to tape it over this movie tape,
"Brighten learns to walk."
Isn't that funny?
I never even heard that name Brighten until I started working -
- Ohhhhh.
Hey, look who's up.
Wow, you guys really nodded off.
Can we go see the "Lion King" again?
/ Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
You're a little late.
The two of you slept right through the last show.
Besides, I got akunas coming out of my matatas.
Is it only playing in one theater?
/ Yes.
All the parents got together and insisted.
Well, come on, don't go anywhere.
We're going to watch "All My Children."
Listen, I haven't seen this soap in seven months.
Catch me up.
Well, they're still at Erica's party, and the new guy slept with what's her face's sister.
P.S., she's late, which means she's pregnant.
Did you hear what they said?
/ What?
I was late to the "Lion King" because we slept together. / So?
So, P.S., I'm pregnant.
I'd better get a job.
Miss Fine not back yet?
/ Oh, no, sir.
She and Kurt went to the movies and then for cappuccinos in Greenwich Village.
Do you think they might have gotten lost?
/ Oh, no, sir.
I think Kurt knows his way around cappuccino country.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, Kurt, stop it.
I can't laugh anymore.
Oh, he does Merril Streep in "Out of Africa" is to die for.
Do it. "I had a farm in Africa ..." Well, he does it better.
Fran, I think Mr. Sheffield has already seen me overact.
Well, I guess I could do it for you if you want ... but I won't.
Meet you upstairs, Fran.
/ Okay.
I'll be up in a few minutes.
Kurt's going to help me decide what clothes to return.
Visa raised my limit.
Well, I showed them.
I hope you don't mind.
I know your rule about men in my room.
Oh, well, Miss Fine, it's a little different with Kurt.
He's more like your friend Val, only with a five o'clock shadow.
You've never seen Val at 5:00.
Oh, I'll tell you, it is just so easy being with Kurt.
I mean, I don't have to act like I give a damn about the Super Bowl, and wherever we go, we go dutch treat.
Although that part I could live without.
But on the upside, I can eat a side of beef in front of him and belch up a hoof.
Want to hand me a plate?
/ Oh, yeah.
Well, I think you two are ideally suited.
You're both charming, outgoing people, terrifically preoccupied with your appearance.
Oh, I know, I know.
We both just get right down to what's important.
I'll tell you, if he was straight, I'd bring him home to my mother.
Well, that's something I'm sure he can be grateful for.
Oh, I'll tell you, it's just the story of my life.
I mean, we could have such a beautiful future together.
We both want the same things.
Except one.
No -- actually, we both want that thing, too.
Well, I know this one's going back.
Wait a second.
Didn't you wear that yesterday?
Yeah, but I didn't break a sweat.
So tell me, is your mother a natural blond, too?
Ah, yeah.
Fran, look at this.
I gotta shave again.
I'm telling you something, you women have it easy.
Oh, honey, talk to me when you got a tongue depressor full of hot bees' wax coming at your bikini line.
Dah-dah.
Oh, now this is fabulous.
/ Yeah?
Zip me up.
Lots of easy access, too. / Oh, good.
And I wasn't sure if the message would get across.
This shows off all my most sensitive areas.
Here, here, here, here -- well, almost all my most sensitive areas.
Hey, remember those puzzles where you had to connect the dots?
/ Yeah, yeah.
Oh, stop it, Kurt.
I'm very ticklish.
Sort of like those college boards where you had to fill in the dots.
Kurt ...
/ Uh-huh.
What's charmeuse?
/ I have no idea.
Oh, my God.
You're not gay?
You're straight?
Oh, I can't believe this.
Oh, this was really bad.
It's too slutty even for me.
When did you find out you were straight?
And does your mother know?
What'd she do?
Dress you in boys' clothes?
Fran, come out of the closet.
/ No.
You go back into the closet.
I cannot believe I told you what I do for yeast infections.
I poured Correctol in front of you.
Ahhhh!
You saw me without makeup on.
Fran, look, if you liked me when you thought I was gay -- / Huh?
-- you're going to love me now.
Come on, Fran. / Huh?
Don't you feel the same way I do?
What did I --
Miss Fine!
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield!
I'm really sorry, Mr. Sheffield.
Boy, this is incredibly embarrassing.
Look, Kurt, you have absolutely nothing to feel embarrassed about.
Miss Fine, will you leave this poor man alone. / Not.
I'm so sorry about this, Kurt.
Oh, you must be feeling terrible.
Oh, my God, she's got lipstick all over you ...
He might have a significant other.
Did you ever stop to think of that?
Kurt, you better go.
Mr. Sheffield's going to hurt himself jumping to conclusions.
I'll call you tomorrow, Fran.
/ Okay.
What was that?
What -- whatwas that thing that just happened there?
Well, I got a news flash for you.
Kurt is a flaming heterosexual.
Not a bad little kisser either.
All right.
While you're here, tell me, should I take this back?
Ah, I think you should put it on.
No.
I already had it on.
It flattens out my --
Oh!
Mr. Sheffield, why didn't you say anything?
Well, I -
- I didn't notice.
You didn't -- you know, I'm beginning to wonder about you too.
Oh ...
Oh, I can't get it on.
I'm stuck.
Help me, help me.
Relax, Miss Fine, we'll get on.
/ Don't rip it.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm so hot.
/ I can't do this standing up.
Just -- just get on the bed.
If you let me tell Miss Babcock about this, I'll work free for a year.
I brought you some pickles and ice cream.
I'm so nauseous and my ankles are swollen.
I hate you.
You did this to me.
I know.
I just wish I knew how.
I'm just so worried.
Are we doing the right thing bringing a child into this world?
Boy, could those kids play house or what?
Ah-ha, just as I thought.
Kurt's teeth are capped.
What?
/ No, no, I'm not making it up.
Look, look, you can see the little ridges.
See.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Maxwell, what is wrong with you today?
If you're not going to pay any attention to me,
I might as well just go home.
Taxi!
I have three words for you --
Orange County bonds.
Mr. Sheffield, I got a couple of things to talk to you about.
No. 1, do not use the downstairs bathroom.
No. 2?
/ Exactly.
Thank you, Miss Fine.
You know, I've just been going through Kurt's resume.
Oh, are you thinking of giving him a job?
/ Well, yes.
Let's see what he's suited for, huh?
/ Okay.
Man in crowd, man at stadium, man in parade ...
Well, he was in "Forrest Gump."
Oh, yes.
There he is.
Man at rally.
That was him?
Well, aren't you a laugh riot.
What?
Have you got in Buddy and Sally under the desk?
Meanwhile, your son wants to talk to you.
Go ahead, honey.
Ah, Dad, I know you want to get me into sports and everything, but why do you always do shows with old ladies?
Well, excuse me, but most people would be honored to be on a team with Katherine Hepburn.
Well, yeah, but did you have to make her catcher?
Put it there.
Put it there.
I mean, how do you pitch to that?
Well, I guess I'm going to go upstairs and get ready for my date with Kurt.
Nanny Fine trying to pass off Kurt as a date.
How pathetic.
This from a woman who went to Cancun with a crash dummy.
Oh, haven't you heard, Cee Cee?
It appears our Kurt is straight.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, that's impossible.
We worked together for several months.
There was actually no sexual tension.
Well, dah ...
Well, I couldn't be happier that Nanny Fine finally found a man.
And what are you looking so smug about?
/ Oh, just an incident in Miss Fine's room last night.
With her and Kurt?
/ No.
With her and another man.
Oh, I love it.
Tell me, tell me.
/ Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.
I swore I wouldn't say a word.
Read this.
Why?
I want to die.
There, there ...
Now don't do anything rash.
Good night, Cee Cee.
/ You animal.
Niles?
/ Sir?
You didn't say anything to Miss Babcock about last night, did you?
No.
You told me not to. / Good.
Niles, do you -- do you think I've been a little too rough on Miss Fine?
Well, she seemed to enjoy it, sir.
I'm not talking about last night.
Oh, Niles, I don't know.
It's this thing with her and Kurt.
Why is it gnawing at me like this?
Well, perhaps you feel that he's not the right man for her, that she'd be happier with someone else.
That's absurd.
They're perfectly suited to each other.
So why do I find it so bloody irritating?
Oh, dear, that was the last apple.
Oh, I'm sorry, old man.
Did you want it?
Well, yes, sir.
But I didn't realize I wanted it until someone else had sunk his teeth into it, and now it's too late.
Oh, God, it was right there in front of me.
If only I'd snatched it up when I had the chance, I wouldn't have this aching hunger.
Oh, God, man, have a bloody pear.
Hi, Niles.
/ Miss Fine ...
Going out with Kurt?
/ Oh, I guess so.
Well, you don't seem very excited.
/ Oh, I know, I should be nuts about the guy.
I mean, he knows everything about me, and he's still interested.
I don't know.
Maybe that's it.
There's no mystery.
It's like when you watch "Columbo." Ten minutes into it, you know who did it.
Then you spend the rest of the hour trying to figure out which one is the glass eye.
Oh, Niles, what's wrong with me?
Oh, dear, that was the last pear.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you want it?
Well, yes, but I didn't realize I wanted it until someone else had sunk his teeth into it.
Well, you snooze, you lose.
Hey, kids, what are you two still doing up?
Niles was supposed to put you to bed an hour ago.
Niles ...
/ Huh?
Oh, this is not my fault.
Yeah.
/ They gave me turkey.
Good night.
/ Good night.
Nine minus seven?
/ Ah, two.
Come on, what are you doing?
/ I'm timing her subtractions ...
Three seconds.
/ It's time.
Oh, no.
We can't have the baby now.
I don't know how to get to the hospital.
Hold it, honey, honey.
Calm down.
Gracie, you're not really having a baby, honey.
But you said when two people sleep together and the girl is late -- well, I was late for the "Lion King." / Oy ...
That's what you were listening to?
Don't put peas up your nose I have to say nine times.
Sweetie, you are definitely not pregnant.
And if you were, we would call in "Geraldo" immediately.
I'm not?
/ No.
Thank God.
I'd like to get a figure before I lose it.
Come on, you two, it's time for bed.
Boy, you two are just so cute.
You go upstairs and have sweet dreams.
Ah, Willie, you sleep in Brighten's room.
Oh, Miss Fine, good, you're home.
/ Hi.
I -
- I wanted to apologize for the way I behaved about you and Kurt.
Oh, well, you know, if I didn't know any better,
I would think that you were jealous.
/ Oh, please, Miss -
- Miss Fine.
No.
I -
- I was just concerned about the children.
I thought maybe they'd get attached to Kurt, and, then, when you break up, they'd be upset.
Well, why are you so quick to say when we break up?
How come you assume my relationships won't work out?
Well, how's it going?
/ It didn't work out.
Oh.
Did you part amicably?
/ No, not at all.
It was very friendly.
Well, don't worry, Miss Fine.
If it isn't Kurt, it will be someone else. / Hum ...
Good night, Miss Fine. / Good night, Mr. Sheffield.
You know, I'm not asking for much really.
I just want someone that's going in the same direction as me.
I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, Miss Fine ...
/ What?
I think you sat in something.
Nope, looking good.
Really, Ma ...
Uh-huh.
-Next stop...
Earth!
Who Can?
cop?
Bastard!
too?
-Damn you...
Somebody help me.
-Whenever evil is a foot...
-And the raging fires of justice burn...
-Great Saiyaman #1...
-And Great Saiyaman #2...
Hand down swift justice!
-Yesssss!
-I'm back!
Take your seat then!
Sorry ti take so long.
The toilet sure was crowded!
-That Gohan!
Who does he think he's fooling?
whish is something all the ladies in the class will understand.
this is Great Saiyaman #2
-There's a weird old man who climbed to the top of the Randsell Tower!
-Can't you guys taka care of such a small thing yourselves?
Hey!
Again...
I've got to go to the toilet.
-Again?
-It must have been something I ate yesterday.
-Leave me alone!
I want to die!
All my hopes and dreams have died!
I'm going to throw myself from this tower.
-I saw a bit of this on tv...
-It's some strange little old man... that old little geezer...
-The Great Saiyaman Powers!
Saiyaman!
Saiyaman!
Saiyaman!
-If doesn't matter who tries to help!
I'm jumping!
it's dangerous up here.
Why don't you come back down with us?
-I...
I was to die!
-Let him do it...
-Videl?
!
will you?
-Fine!
Watch me!
-He wasn't kidding!
-Save me!
-He did it!
-Are you alright?
you know!
-What a weird old man!
-You've never heard of the great hero Tapion?
that's right.
-What a pity.
he saved the people of the planet Konats.
-Wow!
-Gohan.
It's time we were going.
-I'd like to meet him!
-You do...?
-Is he coming to this world?
-Just wanting to meet him isn't enough... is imprisoned inside this beautiful music box.
-He's stuck in there?
But how?
he'll tell you about a future threat!
we've gotta go.
what was that supposed to mean?
-I fear that this world is in great danger!
-The Earth is in danger?
!
-Even now a great galactic evil is heading for this planet.
We need the Great Hero Tapion now more that ever!
I've spent over 30 years searching for this music box.
-So wouldn't it be smart to release him now?
If I could!
-You mean you can't?
-Try and turn the crank.
-This one?
-If you can opet the music box.
Tapion will be released.
-Why didn't if you say tha in the first place?
-It... won't... move!
What's... with... this... thing?
-Let me se.
It's rusted shut!
hey!
-Let's go.
Class is almost over!
Videl!
-Shen Long!
You can bring me to the Shen Long!
-Shen Long?
-He's my only hope of freeing Tapion from this prison.
how...?
please!
I'm begging you!
-So the incident t the Tower was all a trick then?
-Look's like I've been busted!
it sounds like a fantasy story to me.
-I think so too!
-You still don't believe me?
the whole world could be destroyed.
no good.
There's no way to get it open.
It's made from some kind of impervious material.
-It's no good.
I can't open it.
then.
-Is he powerfull?
-Of course!
He was a Great Hero!
-Alright then...
Let's go!
We'll search for the Dragonballs.
All of us.
-The people of Earth are as helpful as I've heard!
-Huh?
You're not from Earth?
I. uh...
It's just an expression!
-Let's go Goten!
I want to be the first to find one!
-Me too!
I want to meet that Great Hero!
-So the story was true after all i wonder what this hero Tapion is like?
Wow!
A real life Great Hero!
-As usual.
I wind up alone.
-Found one!
-Got one!
Now let's find us a hero!
there's one!
-How are you going to get it?
-Not a problem.
Here.
That's the last one of them!
Shen Long!
-Incredible!
This is...
Shen Long!
-I can grant anything you desire.
Speak your wish!
-I want to free the Great Hero Tapion!
-It shall be done.
I leave... what a minute!
Nothing happened!
-It's turning by ifself...
-What a beautiful melody.
what'll happen next...
-He's comming!
Here he comes!
He's here!
-Father...
Incredible energy!
-Everything the old man said was true!
-Wow!
-He looks like a nice guy.
-Don't move!
-Cool sword!
-It was you who imprisoned me!
-Sorry to leave you in such a cramped place for 1000 years.
-Return me at once.
-That won't be possible!
The music box has been broken.
hey...
You're finally back after all this time.
To go back inside is...
-Please leave me alone.
You have no idea of the kind of trouble you grought upon yourselves.
-Trouble?
-I want to be just like him!
-What are you talking about?
He has the rudest manners I've ever seen...
-I'll be back!
Trunks!
please!
-What do you think?
-He's got a dangerous feeling about him.
-I don't get it.
-Trunks!
We should go back now!
-Wht are you talking about?
He's a Great Hero!
Don't you want to hear him tell his story?
-But we have to become friends first...
-That's why we're here!
-What is it?
-Just like a Great Hero!
He looks troubled!
-Where'd the little old guy go?
-That's right...
-He's probably out looking for cute girls.
That's what I'd be doing.
-Not every old man is a disgusting pervert like you!
but you're not bad for an older woman.
they're all gone!
-Got one.
-Ummm...
Big brother!
...
I'll just leave this food over here...
Well... we've got to be going now... okay?
what the hell is going on?
!
Speed it up!
-What was THAT?
-What's going on?
-This is terrible!
-Saiyaman?
Great Saiyaman has come!
Yes!
Leave it to me!
-What is that thing?
-What was that?
What is it?
!
-Some sort of weapon with legs?
No...
It's the bottom half of a monster!
The Great Evil that old man spoke of... could this be it?
let's go to Plan 'A'.
-We're attacking?
-We have to!
evil will taste defeat!
-Great Saiyaman #1.
-And #2.
-Onward to victory!
-I said TO VICTORY!
Weren't you listening?
-Damn!
Nobody wrecks my city like this and gets away with it!
Let's go!
Why won't you fall?
Okay than!
Gohan!
-That's it I have to knock him off balance.
-You did it!
-You did it!
not yet!
-I know that melody.
The monster just disappeared?
-Tapion.
-Gohan!
Look...
I brought you some stuff...
-Stay away from me.
-No need to get so mad at me!
Haven't you eaten anything yet?
-GO AWAY!
-Right!
-Damn it!
-Wha... what!
What happened here?
You're here!
I brought you breakfast... said not to brother you!
So long!
I'll be back later!
-Trunks seceretly smuck him some breakfast this morning.
doesn't he?
-Goten's jealous now that his "big brother" has found a big brother of his own!
-I know how Trunks feels!
I'm an only child as well.
But lately it's been getting dangerous...
-It's Tapion who should worry about Trunks power!
-Hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
That's for my big brother!
You're not supposed to eat it...!
big brother!
I'm putting your dinner over here okay!
Your flute sounds so nice!
Play a little for me?
I guess not!
-You brat!
Give me the flute!
-Trunks!
The flute!
-Right... you brat!
Tapion's no Great Hero!
He's the monster that destoryed the city!
don't believe him.
he'll detroy them all with it if you give it back to him!
So give me the flute!
trust me.
-That's right!
Give me the flute!
-Big brother!
-Wha... wha...
Whaaaat?
-Big brother!
I know...
I'll leave now.
-You're probably hungry.
Mind joining me for dinner?
This is delicious!
You've got to try it!
mking friends with a Great Hero!
-It's just amazing.
He's so excited!
-I don't know how I'll calm him down again!
-Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
This one is my favorite.
I got it for my birthday last year!
Isn't it great?
Eh?
Eh?
it turns into THIS!
give it a try!
This is great!
Having you here.
what about youL?
Do you have any sibilings?
I have a little brother.
cool!
What's he like?
Trunks... a sweet kid.
-Tell me about your planet.
a world called Konats.
green with life and beautiful.
Until the day an evil wizard released a demon upon us.
We were attacked by Hildegarn.
People were killed.
Cities were leveled.
Everything was in runs!
Death semmed inevitable.
Then a miracle happened.
Minoshiya!
Did you die in the midst of all that horror as well?
Trunks!
-Where are you off to?
you're welcome to stay as long as you like!
It's no intrusign!
Trunks couldn't be happier to have you here!
but I can't.
-Why not?
The spirit of that monster is trapped inside my body!
explain it to me.
So what exactly do you mean by "monster spirit"?
-Alright!
I'll tell you the story of how my world was almost destroyed by this monster spirit!
they were granted great powers by their evil master.
They used their black magis and brought the legendary evil of Hildegarn to life.
-Those warlocks must have possessed incredible dark powers.
and Hoi is one of them!
-That old man fooled all of us.
But why is the monster's spirit in your body?
-The warlocks were the only ones who could control them.
Only my legendary flute and sword can keep it in check.
-The warlocks were the only ones who could control them.
Only my legendary flute and sword can keep it in check.
-Your flute and sword?
-Yes.
Weapons from the Gods themselves.
a priest used the sword to split the monster in two - a top halt and a bottom half.
Hildegran's bottom halt was imprisoned in my body.
His top half was imprisoned in my little brother's.
Please returned to the planet Konats.
It was then that my brother and I became known as Great Heroes.
Then how did you get trapped in the music box?
-The warlocks came after the two of us next.
we agreed to be locked away in the music boxes... forever.
the greater the danger of the monster escaping.
We were placed in pods and sent to different ends of the galaxy in the hopes that they wouldn't find us.
But Hoi wants the whole universe as his own!
That's why he came looking for the music boxes!
-What about your brother?
-Most likely he's been killed.
-This is unforgivable!
the full horror of Hildegarn will be released again!
-Is that why for days at time your never sleep?
-Yes.
-No problem!
Leave it to me!
-Ehh?
-How about I build something for you that acts like the music box to help to control the monster's spirit?
-You can do that?
so I'll give it a try!
please!
I'm begging you!
-Alright then!
Wish me luck!
-Yes.
-I've finished it!
Meet me in Tapion's bedroom!
-Really?
-It's got the same configuration as the music box.
-Go on in and take a look.
You can rest at ease in here without worry!
-Thank you so much!
-This is not the full glory and might of Hildegarn!
-This is only the beginning of my great conquest of the galaxy!
-What was that?
-This is what it was all about then.
-Big brother.
What happened to you?
What about Hildegarn?
I don't know how but the top half is inside me now...
But the bottom half is attacking the city!
-What?
he'll possess unbelievable power!
You'll be no hope against him!
-Big brother.
Maybe I can build something more powerful to help you!
you must kill me!
-Big brother!
-Do it quickly!
-No you don't!
-Trunks!
-Big brother!
Play it!
-Right!
-Big brother!
-His body...
-Reformed!
-After a thousand years of waiting the mighty Hildegarn is whole again!
Now drink deeply of these Earthling's energy!
-Big brother!
-It doesn't matter what you try.
He's unstoppable!
-You fool!
-Now you will taste the full power of Hildegarn!
-We can beat him!
-Father!
-From here on in you should leave it up to me.
Stay right here Big brother!
-Trunks.
-We aren't so easily beaten!
-For something that huge.
It sure moves fast!
-Father!
-I can't tell where he's going to reform!
-You've really done it now.
because I'm burning eith rage!
Damn it!
I can't compare to him... either!
-Vegeta!
-Papa!
-Father!
we have to fuse!
-F-U-S-I-O-N HA!
Now you face a third stage Super Saiyajin.
hey you monster!
This has gone far enought Gotenks is here to send you back to hell!
Rapid fire death missile barrage!
hey!
Ohh?
Is that the best you had to offer?
Big wimp!
-What are you doing?
Finish him off!
okay!
Taka that!
-It... can't be!
?
-No way!
-Goten!
Trunks!
-Gohan!
-Videl.
-Such unbelievable power!
That monster!
Damn it!
All this damage... innocent people will be hurt.
Damn!
No matter how much... we throw at it it just won't fall.
-That's it!
Destory the entire galaxy!
All of it will become energy for Hildegarn to feed on!
-Why can't I wake up from this nightmare?
-Big brother.
-You fool!
It's too late for that now!
What?
!
-A Great Hero...
Big brother is definitely a Great Hero!
too!
Feeding on the suffering of people!
With your never ending hunger!
-You can't!
-You did it!
You did it!
Big Brother!
-Trunks!
you must kill me!
You must kill me!
-I can't do that!
-Do you want to be a Great Hero or not?
I can't!
the whole world is in danger while I'm alive.
Do it!
I want to die as a hero!
he'll never be free again!
Do it!
Thank you.
I'm lucky to have met you.
-NOOOOO!
YOUUUU BASTARRRRRRRRD!
-Big brother!
-You fool!
Did you think that you alone could hold back the might of Hildegarn?
I win!
-This must go no further.
that's enought!
He's mine to finish!
his weak point...
-I know it!
I only have one chance to finish him while he's in his full form.
Is that all you've got?
That last punch... was pretty weak!
come on!
Let's see what you've got!
I've got to do this.
I can't lose now!
It I don't do it...
Who will?
DRAGONFIST!
-He did it!
It's my fault that all these people had to die.
If only I could control it!
-Don't worry.
Shen Long will be able to revive all those that were killed.
-That should do it.
It's set. 1000 years in the past... your timeline.
-Thank you.
just when I finally had a big brother and now he's leaving.
you two will meet again.
that's right!
-Trunks!
-For me?
-Yeah!
I've got no use for it anymore.
alright!
-Lucky!
and be well!
Now, for Earth...
"Dragonfist Explosion!
If Goku Doesn't Do It, Who Will"?
Take that!
You bastard!
Who do you think you are!
?
Why, you bast...
Spare me!
As long as there is evil in the world the light of justice will burn as a flame.
Great Saiyaman, Mark I and Mark II whoosh to the scene again!
...whoosh to the scene again!
Nailed it!
I'm back now.
Nice work.
Sorry I took so long.
The bathroom was packed.
Gohan, we know who you are...
All right, let's continue.
Here, the writer, Doskevich, leaves the girls he was in love with.
Yes, this is Great Saiyaman, Mark II.
A strange old man has climbed Raenzel Tower, and is causing a disturbance.
You can handle something like that on your own!
Geez...
Sensei, excuse me, I need to use the bathroom.
Again?
I think the frog I ate yesterday might have been bad.
Just leave me alone!
My hopes and dreams are all gone!
I'm going to jump from here to my death!
Hey, that's the old guy that was carrying on about some music box on TV earlier.
Yeah.
It's that strange old man, huh?
Oh, it's the Great Saiyaman!
Saiyaman!
Saiyaman!
We're counting on you!
Whoever may come up here, I'm not coming down!
Old timer, it's dangerous up here!
Come on down with us!
Go away!
I want to die!
Then why don't you go ahead?
Videl-san!
Come on, hurry up and jump!
All right, watch this!
Y-you're kidding!
Save me!
He did it!
Are you all right?
Couldn't you have saved me sooner!
?
What if I had died!
?
Strange old man...
You don't know about the hero Tapion?
No.
How unfortunate.
Imagine, not knowing about the legendary hero, who saved Planet Conuts in the Southern Galaxy a thousand years ago...
Gohan-kun, we have to get back soon.
I sure would like to meet him.
Wouldn't you, though?
Can I meet him?
I'd like to let you meet him, but I can't.
Unfortunately, the hero Tapion is sealed up inside this mysterious music box.
Inside there?
If he's a hero, then why?
Once the hero is revived, you will understand everything.
Gohan-kun, let's hurry and get back.
Just a moment.
Old timer, what do you mean?
According to my sharp instincts, there is a crisis closing in on the Earth!
A crisis on Earth!
?
An enormous evil, one that will destroy the universe, is approaching Earth.
That is why we need the power of the hero, Tapion, right now!
For that reason, I have spent thirty years searching for this music box.
Then you could just hurry up and revive him, couldn't you?
I would do that, if I could!
You can't do it?
Can you turn this?
This?
If you can get the music box to play, the hero Tapion will be revived.
Oh yeah?
Why didn't you say so sooner?
It won't move...
W-why won't it?
Let me see that a minute.
This thing is rusted.
Miss!
How could you do that!
?
Let's go.
Class is going to end.
Oh, Videl-san!
Shen Long!
Please introduce me to Shen Long.
Shen Long?
Please have Shen Long revive the hero Tapion!
I beg you!
Old timer, how do you...
I discovered that you people have had dealings with Shen Long during my investigations.
Please...
This is my lifelong wish...
Then, that commotion earlier was just an act to call us out?
You found me out, huh?
Gramps, you wouldn't be telling us a fish story, right?
Yeah, don't you think so, too?
Miss, are you still saying that?
There isn't a moment to lose.
If we don't hurry and revive the hero Tapion,
Earth is going to be destroyed.
It's no use.
I can't trace out what's inside.
It looks like it's made of some kind of special material.
Yow.
I can't do it.
If not even Goku can handle it, then I guess it's not completely bogus.
Is this guy strong?
Of course.
He is a hero, after all.
Is that so?
All right...
What do you say we look for the Dragon Balls?
Right.
This is a real godsend for me, to find you here on Earth...
Huh?
Old timer, you mean you ain't from Earth?
T-t-that was just a figure of speech.
All right, Goten!
Let's hurry and find them!
Mm-hmm!
I want to hurry and meet this hero!
Say, if his story is true, what do you think this hero Tapion is like?
Beats me.
I'm so interested in heroes!
Sure enough, I'm all by myself.
Here it is!
All right!
I found the Yi Xing Qiu ball!
Ah, there it is, there it is!
So, how are you going to retrieve it?
Like this!
See?
All right, we should have them all now.
Come forth, Shen Long!
M-marvelous!
This is Shen Long?
I shall grant thee any wish.
Now, speak forth thy wish.
I-I'd like you to remove the seal on the hero Tapion...
That is a simple matter.
I have granted thy wish.
Farewell.
H-hold on, what is this?
Nothing changed, did it?
It's turning!
So it is true, huh?
That's a pretty melody.
There's something a bit sad about it, though.
- Here he comes, here he comes!
- Here he comes, here he comes!
He's here!
Father...
That's an incredible Ki...
So what the old timer said was true.
Awesome!
Isn't he a fine young man?
Stay back!
Cool!
Are you the one who revived me?
It must have been hard to spend those thousands of years in such a tight place.
Who asked you to!
?
Put me back!
That's impossible now.
The music box has been destroyed.
Now, now, you've finally been let out, so let's try to get along...
Please do not come near me.
You people have done a terrible thing!
A terrible thing?
I want to be like him!
What are you talking about?
Any boy who can't even say a word of thanks after we revived him is awful.
- Wait up!
- Ah, Trunks!
No!
Come back here!
Any impressions?
He reeks of danger, huh?
I don't know...
Trunks-kun, we'd better not.
What are you talking about?
He's a hero!
Don't you want to hear all of his stories?
But he said not to come near him.
Yeah, but...
What's wrong?
That's a hero for you!
He's awfully intense.
Huh?
Where did that old timer go?
Now that you mention it...
He's probably gone off to flirt with some pichi-pichi gal!
He's not like a certain dirty old man I could mention.
If not a pichi-pichi gal, perhaps it's some older woman.
Yoink!
Huh?
They're all gone...
Huh?
Ah, here's one, here's one...
Um, Big Brother, we'll just leave this meat here for you.
U-um, Mama's seasoning is pretty good.
Well, we're going home now.
I'll be back tomorrow, okay?
Hey, what are you doing!
?
Hurry and get going!
What was that?
What the...
This is awful!
It's the Saiyamen!
The Great Saiyamen have come!
All right, let's let them take care of this.
What is that thing!
?
What is that thing!
?
What is that!
?
A ghost with legs?
No, it's a monster with just legs!
This could be the enormous evil that the old man was talking about.
That has to be it!
Gohan-kun, let's do our usual!
Eh?
You want to do that!
?
Isn't it obvious?
- As long as the Great Saiyamen are here,
- As long as the Great Saiyamen are here,
- evil shall not prosper in our world!
- Evil shall not prosper in our world!
Great Saiyaman Mark I and Mark II as you expected...
...as you expected...
Hear us out until we've finished!
Damn it...
Wreck the city, will you!
?
You'll pay for this!
Here goes!
What kind of beast is this!
?
All right...
Huh?
Gohan-kun, let him have it!
I get it!
He becomes solid momentarily when he attacks!
All right...
You got him!
No, not yet.
That melody...
The monster disappeared!
Tapion...
Gohan-kun, over there!
B
- Big Brother, if you want, you can use this.
Don't come near me!
Don't get mad, I'm leaving.
Oh, you didn't eat?
Get lost!
R-right!
Oh, no!
W-what!
?
What happened!
?
Thank goodness!
You're safe!
I know.
I'll leave your breakfast here, okay?
Bye.
I'll bring you more later.
Apparently, Trunks-kun has been sneaking food to him.
Oh, yeah?
That's nice of Trunks-kun to do.
He's always talking about how jealous he is of Goten-kun for having an older brother, so maybe he feels like he's got his own big brother now.
I know how Trunks-kun feels.
I'm an only child, too, after all.
But you've been so keyed up lately.
It's Trunks-kun's power that is keyed up!
No!
No!
That's Big Brother's!
You can't eat it!
Aw, geez...
Okay, Big Brother, I'll leave tonight's stuff here, okay?
That flute sounds nice.
Play it some more.
Then again, never mind.
Boy, give me the flute!
Trunks, the flute!
R-right!
Wait, boy!
Tapion is no hero!
He is the very monster that ran wild through the city!
Trunks, don't let him fool you.
If you give him the flute, then the whole earth, to say nothing of the universe, will be completely destroyed!
Now, hand it over to me.
Trunks, trust me.
Come on...
That's it, hurry and give me the flute.
Big Brother!
W-what!
?
Big Brother!
I know...
I'm going...
I sure am hungry.
Would you eat with me?
This is really delicious!
Try some!
Trunks brought his big brother over to spend the night.
Isn't that amazing?
I mean, becoming friends with a hero...
He is absolutely delighted.
See?
See?
See?
This is awesome!
They bought it for me for my birthday last year.
Look!
Well?
Isn't this fun?
And look, when you do this here, it does this!
Say, Big Brother, you try it.
And actually, after that, you know what?
Say, Big Brother, do you have any brothers?
Yeah, one younger brother.
Wow, that's great!
What kind of boy is he?
He was a kind boy, like you, Trunks.
Say, tell me about your planet, Big Brother.
Sure.
My home is a place called Planet Conuts, in the Southern Galaxy.
It was a beautiful planet, which like Earth here, was blessed with greenery and water.
But then, one day, there was a warlock who raised this phantasm named Hildegarn, which attacked us.
People were killed, and cities were demolished and destroyed.
Just as everyone had resigned themselves to die, a miracle happened.
Minoshia... you've been killed, huh?
Take care, Trunks.
Where are you going?
If you'd like, you're welcome to stay with us from now on.
Please, feel free.
Trunks would be thrilled, after all.
I can't do that.
Why not?
There is a phantasm locked away inside my body.
Huh?
A phantasm?
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.
Explain it to me.
What is this "phantasm"?
Right...
There was a sect of warlocks that drifted in from somewhere...
They took the spirit body of the totem that had absorbed all of the evil will on Planet Conuts, infused it with wicked energy, and transformed it into the phantasm Hildegarn.
Those warlocks must have had incredible demonic powers, huh?
Yes.
Hoi was one of their order.
Then we were all completely taken in by that old man.
But why is the phantasm within your body?
It's because there was a legendary sword and flute that could control the totem.
By any chance, do you mean those?
Yes.
These items were given to us by God.
While we suppressed the phantasm's power with the flute, a priest who was in the service of God split the phantasm's body into an upper half and a lower half.
And then, Hildegarn's upper half was locked inside my body, and the lower half was locked inside my brother's body.
Peace returned to Planet Conuts.
As a result, my brother and I were hailed as heroes.
But you were inside that music box, right?
The warlocks tried to retake the phantasm, and began coming after us.
And so to lock away the phantasm forever, we had ourselves sealed up inside those music boxes.
However, with the two of us near each other, the upper half and the lower half resonated with each other, trying to reunite.
In order to keep the phantasm from ever being revived, the two of us were each sent away in pods to different galaxies.
However, Hoi wants to make the whole universe his own, so he located both of our music boxes.
Where is your brother?
He has probably been killed already.
We can't let Hoi get away with this.
As long as I keep his upper half locked away,
Hildegarn cannot be revived in his complete form.
You mean, you haven't slept in all these days since you were released?
N-no.
All right, let me take care of this.
All I have to do is make something like that music box, to keep that power under control, right?
C-can you do that?
I haven't thrown out the broken music box yet, so I think I can.
Please make it, I beg you!
You got it.
Hang in there until then, okay?
Yes.
There you go!
It's all done!
Tapion's bedroom!
Really!
?
Inside here should be just like the music box.
Go on inside and see.
You can go in there and sleep without having to worry.
Thank you very much!
Once Hildegarn is reunited, this will be nothing!
I will hold the whole universe in my hand, starting with Earth!
I will hold the whole universe in my hand, starting with Earth!
What!
?
Is that right?
So that's what the story is, huh?
Big Brother!
What happened to you?
Where's Hildegarn?
I somehow managed to lock his upper half inside my body, but his lower half is running loose in the city!
What!
?
The power attracting his upper half and lower half together has gotten stronger, and there's nothing more that I can do!
Big Brother!
I can make something even sturdier!
It's too late now!
N-now, while you still can, please, you have to kill me, and Hildegarn with me!
Big Brother!
Now!
Hurry!
I won't let you do that!
Trunks!
Big Brother, play it!
All right!
Big Brother!
His body...
It's reunited!
After a millennium's worth of time, the phantasm Hildegarn has now been completely revived!
Now, suck dry as much energy from the Earthlings as you like!
Damn it!
Big Brother!
That thing won't do you any more good!
Impossible!
Behold, the power of the completely restored Hildegarn!
You'll have to face me!
Huh?
Father!
Leave it to us from here on, okay?
Big Brother, don't you move from here.
Trunks!
We ain't letting you have your way!
His power and speed have risen to a whole new level!
Father!
I can't get a bead on his solid form!
Smash up another man's house, will you!
?
I am in a foul mood today!
Don't come too close, or you'll get burned!
Dammit!
I was too easy... on him...
Vegeta!
Papa!
Father!
Goten, Fusion!
All right...
- Fu-sion!
- Fu-sion!
- Ha!
- Ha!
Yay!
Super Saiyan 3, right out of the gate!
Yay!
Super Saiyan 3, right out of the gate!
Yo, yo, monster!
You're finished now!
Gotenks-sama is going to send you off to Yama-sama's place!
Now!
Continuous Die-Die Missiles!
Hmm?
Finished already?
Aw, that was disappointing.
What are you doing!
?
Hurry and finish him off!
Okay, okay...
I-it can't be...
You're kidding!
Goten!
Trunks!
Gohan-kun!
Videl-san...
What incredible power!
He really is a monster!
Dammit!
Oh, crap!
All of our attacks are going right though him!
Damn...
No matter how much power we have it's no use against him...
Destroy the entire universe!
It will all become power for you, Hildegarn!
If this is a bad dream, then wake up...
Big Brother!
You fool!
You think that thing is going to work at this point!
?
What!
?
A hero...
Big Brother is a hero, all right!
I cannot allow this planet to get caught in the middle of this, too.
How much longer will you feed on the suffering of others like this until you've had enough?
Impossible!
You did it!
You did it, Big Brother!
You did it, Big Brother!
Trunks...
Kill me, and Hildegarn with me!
You have to protect Earth!
I-I can't do that!
Kill me!
You want to be a hero too, don't you!
?
I-I can't!
Trunks, if this keeps up, Earth will be destroyed.
Please, let me die as a hero!
If he is revived one more time, there will be no stopping him.
Please!
Thank you.
I'm glad to have met you.
S-stop!
Big Brother!
Fool!
You do not have the power to contain Hildegarn in his complete form!
Get them!
There ain't no way you're going to get away with this!
Trunks, stay out of this!
I'm going to defeat him!
Father!
His weakness is...
I know!
I can only beat him to attack during the instant when he's solid!
That won't work.
This sort of punch won't work!
Fight like you mean it!
Hey, what's the matter?
Come and get me!
If I don't do it...
If I don't do it...
If I don't do it who will!
?
Ryu-ken!
You did it!
It's my fault that so many people were made to die.
If only I had been able to fully control Hildegarn...
Don't worry.
We'll ask Shen Long to bring those who were killed back to life.
There.
Now you should be able to go back a thousand years, to your time.
T-thanks.
Aww, and here I had finally gotten a Big Brother.
As long as we have the time machine, you can see him again.
Oh, that's right!
Trunks!
You're giving it to me?
Yeah.
I don't need it anymore, after all.
- All right!
Yay!
Yay!
- How nice!
Okay then, everyone, take care!
This blue world now shines, embraced in love.
I wouldn't lie to you!
I won't stand by and let anyone destroy the earth, where dreams dance!
With a bang-up passion, Dragon Ball!
When I throw a punch, he disappears like smoke.
My foe this time has me bowled over.
(Go!
) Don't let your guard down!
(Jump!
) Gohan and Videl!
(Go!
) Even if your friends... (Kick!
)... get taken down, in the end, if I don't do it, who will!
?
I wouldn't lie to you!
I'm through playing around!
I'm going to show you my Super Saiyan power!

The events you are about to see were inspired by the true story of Graham Young...
All characters save those in the Young Family are entirely ficticious... any resemblance to any other person or company is entirely co-incidental...
Graham never obtained poison from his employers, he bought it from a specialist chemist.
THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK
I was very young when I realized I had a gift for chemistry.
My earliest memories were quiet afternoons spent in the serenity of my parent's home.
...gazing at some new-found wonder of scientific discovery.
By the time I was in my teenage years I was beginning to see life as it really was.
A series of illusions that only the scientist could strip away.
I wanted to see this hidden world.
To lift the veil.
And hold the secret of existence in the palm of my hand.
And this is a gift, from me to you.
For your experiments.
A HANDBOOK FOR EXPERIMENTS AND EXPLICATIONS
I had little in common with my father, my sister and my step-mother.
And life at home was a stale affair.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please put your hands together for Mister...
Dickie Boone!
Think I'll make us all a nice cup of tea.
But I tried hard to look upon my time there as an opportunity for research.
After all, even the most ordinary domestic item has its scientific value.
He in my bloody room again?
He is!
I'll kill the little swine!
Dad!
Graham Young, if you've been interfering in my private things again I'll swing for you!
Wait!
Get back in here you!
Dad, I want a lock put on that door!
NURSE ESTHER wants to take your pulse.
Blimey O'Reilly Fred.
What the devil have you put in this tea?
Smells all ammoniary, Dad.
Smells like brake fluid.
Smells like cat's piss.
Graham!
Get your back side in here.
Have you been using your mother's cups and saucers for your bloody experiments?
What have I told you?
Taste this!
Go on!
Taste it!
Let go of me.
It's got nothing to do with me.
You want to ask her.
Ask her what she was mixing up in the kitchen last night.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
I think you recall mixing a certain something in one of my ma's teacups.
Oh, you didn't use the best china Winn?
- She most certainly did.
- Shut up you.
What was she mixing?
Her stuff.
- What stuff?
- Yes.
What was that stuff?
Will you tell him to shut his mouth before I kick him in it!
Yeah, shut up you.
Did you or did you not mix up some stuff in one of your mother's best teacups?
Yes.
Now we're getting somewhere.
What was it?
Doesn't matter what it was.
- It was private.
- Private?
Women's private.
For removing unwanted- You know what.
- No, I don't know what.
- You are not pregnant, are you?
No I'm not.
Someone get him out of here.
What was she mixing?
Oh, for God's sake, let it drop!
Come on love, you can tell me, I'm your fiancé.
I think this might provide some answers.
You bastard!
- Give us that here.
- No!
Depilatory cream for use on problem moustaches vanish in minutes.
Crikey, love...
You never told me about this.
Watch out Dennis, I reckon she's turning into a werewolf.
You didn't tell me about that stuff.
How was I supposed to know about it?
I knew there would be some who would want to stand in my way.
But I would not be swerved.
I was on the verge...
The verge of a great discovery.
NURSE "ETHER" wants to take your pulse.
RESTRICTED BOOK.
These books have been removed from our shelves because they are considered unsuitable for readers under eighteen years of age.
A fact of which you should be perfectly cognoscenti Mr. Young.
Gray's Anatomy.
Pathology for the Student Nurse.
My Friends on the Slab.
They're for my father.
He's asked me to do some research for him.
He's a GP, you see?
No, he isn't.
He's a machine setter at Cadogan's.
And your mother plays the accordion at The Spotted Dog.
And from now on, Mr. Young, you will restrict your reading matter to the appropriate section.
I'll have you know I'm presently involved in a series of highly important scientific experiments.
Children's Library through the swing-doors on your way out.
Hey.
In here.
Are these what you wanted?
Thank you, Miss Buttler.
You're very kind.
Do you fancy a date, Graham?
Don't be shy.
WEST WATERS RESERVOIR:
Serving the homes of over 1 million people
Every king needs a queen.
And I had found mine.
I decided to pursue my work with renewed vigor.
While others followed the common course my every waking hour was consumed with study.
- What have you got today?
- Advanced pathology and A cycle of killers.
No!
Sandwiches.
Oh, egg and cress.
Swaps.
And then, one day I found it.
An experiment which captured my imagination like nothing before.
Antimony sulphide.
One of nature's most volatile substances.
If treated incorrectly it leaves the residue of a lethal poison.
But Newton discovered that it could also be transformed in the flask, into a diamond of breath-taking beauty.
Then and there, I vowed that this time it would be mine.
Damn.
The effects of antimony poisoning... i.e. vomiting and severe abdominal pain, are easily confused with a whole host of intestinal disorders.
Swaps.
As recently as 1942, Ronald O' Keefe, a young New York accountant succeeded in poisoning his secretary's lunch-time ham sandwiches with antimony.
Cleverly disguising the poison's sharp tartaric taste with a liberal sprinkling of mustard powder.
- Mustard powder?
- Yeah, there's a picture of her stomach here.
Oh, God!
That's disgusting!
I thought Dexter had banished you to the junior shelves?
I've a contact.
She can get me anything I want, anytime I want.
Sue Buttler.
Well, you can lay off there if you don't mind.
I've been softening her up for weeks.
Do you know her?
Know her?
Sue and me... or is it me and Sue?
Have a date this Friday night.
Front Circle, Golders Green Hippodrome.
Admit, two only.
It's just that we made a date too.
Weeks ago as a matter of fact.
You...?
When did she give you that?
Your months out of date pal.
Look.
It's almost completely faded.
Oh, you don't believe me, Graham?
Go on.
Take a look.
Nothing wrong with the print quality on that.
MUSTARD
Ladies and gentlemen will you please put your hands together for Mr. Dickie Boone!
You know it's true.
I'm in love with you.
I try to hide it but I just can't do it.
I know its no good.
I've never been so sure before.
I can't ignore this feeling of love all around, everywhere.
Everywhere I go.
I let it all hang out.
It's a mystery.
What you do to me?
I get a feeling, it's an Oody Doodie feeling that you're the one for me.
I wanna be your company.
All the world to see.
This feeling of love all around, everywhere.
Sorry about all the sauce.
Terrible predilection I have for ketchup.
When I was a boy I drank a whole bottle on my way home from a fish chip shop.
It looks like a road accident, doesn't it, Sue?
We'd a terrible one last summer.
Our house is very close to one of the north's circular's black spots.
Awful thing.
- Was anybody hurt?
- Yes.
A young woman.
Mercifully she was killed outright.
Thrown fifty yards through the windscreen, decapitated.
Yes.
The firemen searched up and down the road for hours, couldn't find it.
Eventually it turned up in Hatfield.
Seems its trajectory had sent it across the central reservation and into the oncoming traffic.
It landed in this chap's camping trailer.
When he arrived at his destination he looked in the back and found an extra item, as it were that was not on the packing list.
Sometimes the speed of impact can force the head so that it disappears completely.
Right inside the ribcage.
What do you think about this?
I'm going to miss my bus.
Here's the money for the tea.
You left your chocolates.
Filthy little tripe hound!
What's the meaning of these?
Hey?
They're not mine.
Do you want to look at these whores?
Do you?
I told you they're not mine!
You wouldn't do this in a million years if you had any respect for your body, would you?
No, mum.
I'd rather someone took me out and shot me.
Now there's an idea.
Look, I told you, I've never set eyes on them before.
Then what were they doing behind the immersion tank in my bedroom?
You're not suggesting they're your sisters'?
I don't know whose they are.
Maybe they're her boyfriend's.
Dennis?
Dennis is a Supervisory Weights and Measures Officer for the Board of Trade, thank you very much.
You're sick.
D'you know that?
They're not mine!
Who's are they then if they're not yours?
Get in that bath!
What?
Get in that ruddy bath before i...!
You contaminate everything you touch, don't you?
Well, I'm going to scrub you till you're raw.
You foul minded little demon!
I fell asleep in my loved one's arms.
And that night I dreamt of my diamond.
I was happy in my sleep because the diamond was mine.
But when I woke up it was gone.
Graham!
Refills already?
Just one item today, Mr. Goez.
I could see now that everything had been leading to this moment.
I had decided on the direction my scientific career was to take.
And there could be no turning back.
TO MY DARLING MOTHER
Where have you been?
Mum's inside, with Doctor Scott.
Does he know what's wrong with her?
How the hell should I know?
I told you, he's in there now.
She'll be all right now.
I've given her some muscle relaxant and a rectal lavage.
- Lavage?
- An enema, father.
Enema?
What on earth did she need that for?
Have you any idea what brought it on?
Rich food, I imagine.
Rich food?
In this house?
Forgive me Mr. Young, but as I understand it your wife's discomfort was preceded by the ingestion of half a box of Velvet Victories.
I've given her some soothing medicine for her tummy...
Otherwise it'll be the usual drill, plenty of fluid, and no staring into the fire.
I'll leave it to our young medical expert here to make sure she does what she's told.
Two spoonful's daily.
After meals.
The first stage of the experiment had gone to plan.
Now there was only one obstacle in my path.
Graham, where's that medicine?
Mum's waiting!
I'm coming!
The prying eyes of my dear sister Winnie.
She's supposed to get two of those.
I know, thank you.
Christ!
Would you not sneak up on people like that?
Sorry.
I just thought I'd bring you a cup of tea.
What's turned you into an angel all of a sudden?
Nothing.
I just think we should all stick together now that mum's ill.
Oh, for God's sake Graham, your acting as if she's on death's door.
She's only got a touch of the tummy wobbles.
- I'm not so sure.
- What are you getting at?
Nothing really, just a thought.
Drink your tea before it gets cold.
With that I was free to conduct my experiment without interruption.
Oh, dear!
Dog breath love!
Smells like...
Like what?
Like death.
Sweet Jesus.
MARCH
APRIL
MAY
Hello, Percy.
Talk about something nice...
for a change.
- She had to have it all cut out.
- Shut up.
- Well she did.
- All right, we've heard it all before.
- She had one of them bags to hold out.
- All right, give it up.
Well I never!
Look at this, uncle Jack.
Quite the young toff these days, aren't we?
Looks like a bloody funeral director.
Been out courting, nephew?
I'm afraid I don't have time for anything but my work these days, auntie.
Still finding the cure for cancer, are you?
So what's your diagnosis on all this then Graham?
Well, Dr. Scott seems to think it's some kind of nervous stomach disorder but I'm exploring other avenues.
I'm just off to Dennis'.
See you later.
Ah, poor girl.
And you say she bought it from Boots?
Oh, you've no idea how many lethal products are sold over the counter these days, auntie.
Well, they're normally very good, aren't they?
They do these wine making kits now.
These people will put anything in their products as long as they sell.
They're completey unscrupulous.
I wouldn't be surprised if this is exactly the kind of thing behind my poor mother's illness.
Well, I must say you seem to know an awful lot about this sort of thing...
He's my little Louis Pasteur.
Aren't you, Graham?
Suspicion had been voiced.
It was necessary to deliver the fatal blow.
And then, one day the solution presented itself.
It was a true story that I was reading.
A unit of Dutch resistance fighters had poisoned the Nazi's water supply with a substance called "Thallium".
Over the next few days, the Nazis dropped dead, one by one.
Each of them apparently from a different cause.
They all had only one symptom in common all their hair had fallen out.
I decided to research the substance more thoroughly.
I've got something to give you.
It's a diamond ring.
It was your mother's.
Fred gave it to me when we married, but I've never been able to wear it.
Want you to have it for always.
Its yours by right.
Oh, Graham...
How funny.
It should have taken all this to bring us together.
Graham?
Graham?
EXPERIMENT 4:
Antimony Poisoning:
Molly Young
STABILIZING
TO POISON
Dad, tins can't go off!
Pull yourself together, will you?
I'm going to find out what's behind this if I have to tear the house apart.
Hope you are not gonna have another nervous breakdown like you did when our first mother died.
What did you say?
You did, didn't you?
Don't think I'll be here to look after you.
Or our Graham for that matter coz I shalln't.
God, it's no wonder he turned out so sodding weird.
Christ, just look at her, will you?
I don't reckon she even knows who we are anymore.
She's not been near that toilet for days.
- Yes she has, haven't you mum?
- She hasn't, you know.
I would've heard her if she had.
Have you been to the toilet for solids, in the past 24 hours, mother?
For solids, not just pee-pee.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Never a day's illness in her life!
Strong as a cart-horse!
And now look at her!
She's like a broken stick!
She can hear you!
Help me get her head back.
For God's sake, can't you see?
She don't want it!
Bloody buffoon.
I've a mind its this its making her worse!
She's trying to tell us something.
What is it, mother?
Is it the medicine?
What she's trying to say is she wants us to give it to her.
It's just too painful for her to swallow.
What the hell are we supposed to do?
Look, I think you should both go off to work.
You're just getting yourselves in a state.
I'll take the day off school, read to her.
Maybe she'll take some later on when she's feeling more relaxed.
Come on you can walk me to the bus.
The Thallium had been a greater success than I could possibly have hoped.
After she was gone we couldn't decide whether to buy her a walnut coffin or an afromosia teak.
Finally we settled on walnut.
She'd always liked walnuts.
And alongside the inevitable sadness I found myself pondering an interesting question.
Namely...
That while being a good poisoner involves remaining undetected becoming a famous one would seem to demand getting caught.
Such were my thoughts as I watched my stepmother go up in smoke that day.
Don't you talk to me like that!
No!
Shut up!
Piss off, will you?
Don't tell me to piss off.
May I help you to some pickle, uncle Jack?
Yeah, go on.
Go on, yeah.
Just a jot.
Help things down.
Look I don't want to worry you.
And not a word of this to Winn.
But...
Well, I've been feeling a bit queer myself these past few days.
You know?
Same symptoms as your mum.
No, you're imagining it, dad.
You feel guilty about her suffering and you won't let her go without suffering yourself.
Anyway, if you're worried, we could always call doctor Scott.
No fear.
I'm not having that clown shoving things up my anus.
Mind my pint.
I'll be back in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
I had discovered my métier.
Thallium was to be my life's work.
Tasteless, colourless, odorless, untraceable.
I would be the greatest poisoner the world had ever seen.
Hello, Graham.
Hello, Mick.
Hello, Sue.
We heard about your mum.
Your Dad's on his last legs and all, I hear.
Yes.
Same hospital, same symptoms, two weeks later?
Stroke of bad luck that, isn't it?
Think I heard everyone in your street has come down with some bug or other.
Rate your going you'll be the only bastard left in Neasden.
My mother died of a prolapsed bone at the top of her spinal column, Michael.
She slipped whilst walking in the garden and it snapped.
Just like that.
No bugs, Michael.
No bug's mentioned here.
And if I were you, I'd watch how you speak to me in future.
Both of you.
Have you any idea where he is?
He's not here at the moment.
- Was it you who called?
- I'm his auntie.
That was my exit dose, you fucking idiot!
Now you've gone and ruined everything.
Everything!
I was convicted of murder and attempted murder.
And after my trial, which was a swift affair the judge sent me for medical tests.
The evidence was conclusive.
I was an incurable psychopath.
And was to be locked away for life.
Prisoner 2338175, Graham Frederick Young, Home Secretary's warrant..
...for detention and the prison's medical dossier, Sir!
- Pink Card, Mr. Hopwood?
- Pink Card, Mr. Trent.
Carry this at all times.
Fourteen years old, eh?
Welcome to HarshHurst, son.
We hope you enjoy your stay.
TWO YEARS LATER.
Dad!
My bunk mate, Berridge, was a young soldier from Lewisham who'd come home on leave one day and shot both his parents in the head.
Mummy?
He was about to relive this episode for the second time that night.
Berridge.
Berridge.
Berridge, wake up.
You're dreaming again.
Let's go back to sleep.
Did you never have this, Graham...
your mum, visions and that?
No!
Lucky.
Perhaps this new bloke might be able to do something for me.
What new bloke?
I heard in the office we are getting a new senior... psy...chologist chiatrist.
Doctor Zeigler.
They reckon he's one of the best.
You work with him and then if he reckons you're cured he recommends you to the Home Office.
My career as a poisoner may have been temporarily interrupted but I had not entirely wasted the last two years.
Having worked my way up from the tailor shop, to the carpentry class...
I found my way into block two.
Which has HarshHurst's considerable library.
Within days of my arrival I had the run of the shelves.
The Danish doctors, have applied a treatment of castration to their criminal psychopaths.
Which they say promises well.
Purely from a medical and legal standpoint they are nothing but a bloody nuisance.
The lawyers don't know how to convict them and we don't know how to cure them.
Have any of them had any kind of individual treatment since they arrived?
Doctor Zeigler, these patients are not labelled chronic simply for our convenience.
Here at HarshHurst we forego the luxuries of rehabilitation.
And humbly limit ourselves to the more mundane tasks of control and protection.
I see.
So, all of these men are classified as psychopaths?
Moral imbeciles to a man.
Allow me to demonstrate.
What's your name, boy?
Berridge, Sir.
And why are you here, Berridge?
I killed my parents, Sir.
And if you had your time over, would you do it again?
No, Sir.
No, Sir.
Why "No, Sir"?
Why do you think you would not do it again?
Because they'd send me back to this place, Sir.
"Because they would send me back to this place, Sir."
A conditioned response indicating fear of reprisal.
There's no moral sense at work here at all.
In my experience psychopaths rarely show the least sign of inner change or development.
"Vulpes pilum mutat, non mores", as they say.
The leopard never changes his spots.
- Wolf, Sir.
- Did you speak, boy?
Sorry, Sir, but vulpes means wolf, Sir.
"Vulpes pilum mutat, non mores" means, literally the wolf changes its fur but not its nature, Sir.
Not that it changes the essential point of your argument I'm sure you're absolutely right.
And so it was, that the very next day I was selected for treatment by the famous doctor Zeigler.
Are you going to cure me, Sir?
Sit down, please.
Well, hmm...
That's what we're here to find out.
Do you think I'll ever get out?
I don't think we should speculate on these things just at the moment.
I think that we should apply ourselves to the work that's ahead of us.
Do you think that you're up to it?
I want to live rightly and lovingly, Sir.
And what do you think has prevented you from doing so up until now?
I don't know, Sir.
Doctor Triefus says something inside me has died.
He says I'll never be able to feel anything for anybody.
And you always believe what Doctor Triefus says to you?
Maybe you'll allow me to be the judge of that from now on.
All right, this thing that Doctor Triefus says has died inside you.
Let's say just for the moment, that it hasn't died.
Let's say that it isn't functioning properly.
How so, Sir?
Well, I like to think that our emotional functions are not unlike our limbs, our organs, they can be broken, damaged.
And I like to think that anything that's broken or damaged, can also be fixed.
You're going to fix me, Sir?
Well, it's not just going to be up to me.
You're going to be doing most of the work.
How will you know I'm not faking it?
Because...
The work that we are going to be doing here in this room we're gonna be doing together.
D'you see?
I'm gonna be with you on this journey.
And...
When we find what we're looking for we will know.
I want you to, uhm, tell me your dreams.
You'd like me to tell you my dreams, Sir?
Yes, I want you to...
write them down.
Somebody once said that...
"until something is written down, it doesn't really exist".
And, the same with our dreams.
Once you put your dreams on paper, then we'll be able to examine them and see what they have to show us.
Will you do that for me?
I think it's a wonderful idea, Sir.
And I'd like to thank you for this opportunity.
Up to that point I'd been doing brilliantly with Dr. Zeigler.
Or so I thought.
But he had asked me to give him the one thing which I couldn't provide.
In all my time in HarshHurst, I'd not been able to remember a single solitary dream.
I'm standing in a room, and there are these two exits.
One leads down the stairs into darkness...
And at first I think I really want to go down there and see what's going on.
The other leads out into fields of quiet sunshine.
And suddenly I'm at the side of a lake.
And I have my chemicals with me, bottles and bottles of poisons.
One by one I tip them into the lake.
When I'm finished I feel cleansed.
And then I wake up.
What do you think this is trying to tell us?
I think it's trying to tell us that we're wasting our time.
You've made this up.
Yes?
Do you have any idea how much trouble I've gone to on your behalf?
There's 700 men in this institution I've got the impossible task of selecting a handful with whom I can find the time to work.
Now, if you're not prepared to give of yourself honestly i promise you that I'll find a replacement who will.
So I had one more chance.
Doctor Zeigler was obviously a man who required the real thing.
But where was I to find it?
You what?
I think we need to extract them.
As if they were a poison.
I think we need to write them down.
Somebody once said that, "until something's been written down..."
..."it doesn't really exist."
- I can't write.
- It doesn't matter.
You can tell them to me, and I'll write them down.
And then, once they're on paper we have them, you see?
They're ours.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
Well it starts like this, I walk in the house.
And the whole place smells of fat pig fat like, you know, really sweet.
And then I see, my mum and dad there, their limbs are all hanging off.
And they're all green and rotten inside.
The worst bit is when I go into the toilet.
I go into the toilet because I'm going to be sick with the smell.
I look into the bowl, and I can see my mum's head.
My mum's head's staring back at me from the bowl.
Then her face comes up out of the toilet bowl, lips quivering with rage gums bad and bleeding.
She wants to devour me.
She grabs me by the throat, begins to drag me down into the bowl.
Yeah, and that's where he wakes up.
What exactly would you like us to conclude from all this?
Well, yes, all right.
I know that you're sceptical doctor, but if we can't help this boy who is so intelligent and in such pain.
Who can we help?
I mean...
What is the purpose of our work here?
And so, thanks to the zeal of Doctor Zeigler I was plucked from the ranks and planted firmly on the road to recovery.
I woke up at home, I was in my own bed.
There's a thunder storm.
My mum.
She said let me sleep.
Every night, Berridge would offer out the fruits of his rabid psyche.
And every morning I would offer them up as if they were my very own.
I was happy.
Dr. Zeigler was happy.
Even Dr. Triefus was happy.
There was only one person who was not.
Berridge.
Berridge.
It's all right, it's all right.
I'm here.
Now tell me what's happening.
Tell me everything you see.
- I can't, it won't come.
- It will come, it wants to come.
No.
Look, we've got to get this stuff out, Berridge.
We mustn't let it fester, must we?
Not like your parents.
And the bedroom carpet.
No.
I can't.
You can, Berridge, and you must.
Come on!
Think, damn you!
It's not working.
Just leave me alone.
Poor Berridge, I'd been waking him on the hour, every hour, for the past three months.
It seemed he'd finally reached the end of his tether.
There's nothing that you could have done.
The important thing is you stuck by him.
You were his friend.
I don't know.
I could have spent more time with him.
Listened to his cries for help.
Sometimes it isn't our place to help, you know?
That's a lesson I've had to learn many times... in my work.
Look...
You've made a friend, you're grieving because he's left.
And that's good, it's a common... unhappiness.
It's a price we pay for getting close.
So, that's what it was.
It seems I really did miss him.
But it was a double-blow.
My future freedom depended on Berridge's endless flow of dreams.
And his death had cut off my supply.
We waited, and we waited, and we waited.
Maybe it's the loss, Sir.
Maybe I haven't recovered from the trauma of his death.
Perhaps that's why the dreams won't come.
Yes, well perhaps it's I and not your dreams that's failed you.
Sometimes when we push too hard, nature doesn't like it.
- I'm sure if we just waited a little--
- No, I'm sorry, Graham...
I'm afraid it's all rather out of my hands now.
There are others coming up for parole that need my help and if I'm to continue my work here, I have to show results.
So...
We'll keep in touch, of course.
And there will be an ongoing program of therapy with other doctors.
You'll be in very good hands.
What?
Like Berridge was?
Goodbye Dr. Zeigler.
Please accept my apologies for wasting your valuable time.
And then, just as I had abandoned all hope the strangest thing occurred.
It was my diamond.
And that night it came back to me more brilliantly than ever.
I wrote it all down for him.
Dr. Zeigler!
- Graham!
- Dr. Zeigler, I had a dream!
A real one!
I've written it down for you!
It's all right, let him go.
Let him go!
Thank you, Graham.
I look forward to reading this.
But now I think you must go back into the line.
Yes?
And you'll leave this with me over the weekend.
Graham, go back into the line!
Why haven't you told me about this before?
Graham!
It's a secret.
Well, I want to know about this experiment with the diamond.
All right, I'll tell you.
You were using a substance called antimony.
Deadly poison.
But actually, that's not what interested you.
You wanted to use it to make something beautiful.
To make this...
diamond of Newton's.
But something went wrong, it blew up in your face.
Yes?
And then later you used the same substance to poison your step-mother.
Am I right?
I'm not that simple.
I switched poisons to fool them.
I used a substance called Thallium.
That's what killed her.
- Thallium?
- It's a heavy metal, probably the most toxic substance known to man.
Before I was caught, I was working on a compound that would have made it completely untraceable.
A doomsday weapon.
I would have used it too.
But something went wrong.
- No.
- Yes.
Otherwise you'd be out there now, ruling the world, but you ended up in here.
Now...
I think that, this dream is pointing us to a moment...
The moment when things started to go... very wrong for you.
You see?
You wanted to make something beautiful in that flask, that day.
And something turned it into a poison.
Now, I think that we ought to go back and do that experiment again.
And maybe this time we can make things go in a different way.
Why should I share my knowledge with you?
You've told me what I am.
Nobody cares about me.
I've got nothing, I can't feel anything, fine?
But I have my secrets.
And why should I show them to you or anybody else?
They're mine.
They're all I've got.
Well, maybe this will make you change your mind.
And would you believe I cried real tears?
Torrents and torrents of them.
Tears of the death of my mother, tears of the death of my friend.
And tears of the rotten world that had made me this way.
I claimed then that my redemption was sure to follow.
SEVERAL YEARS LATER
It is precisely by allowing Graham to continue his scientific studies in here that I've been able to wean him from morbid science towards a more responsible and humane application of his interests.
What was bad in the flask has been made good in the flask.
I don't claim to have achieved miracles.
One can achieve nothing unless the raw material is already in place.
Well, thank you for your introduction, Doctor.
Perhaps we should see the patient for ourselves?
Please, be seated, Graham.
Try not to be nervous, okay?
So, who'd like to kick-off?
Graham, we were all impressed by your academic achievements here at HarshHurst.
I wonder, would you like to tell us a little about the work you're doing at the moment.
Well, we've been looking at-- Sorry, that's myself and Dr. Zeigler.
Have been looking at the work of chemists in the 16th and 17th centuries who were investigating the medicinal possibilities of various curative herbs.
Thanks to the help of Doctor Zeigler, I've managed to comandeer a small section of the grounds.
And create a physic garden, much as it would have been laid out at the time.
Sounds fascinating.
Have you found any that work?
Well, we still haven't found a cure for the common cold, I'm afraid.
Thank you, Graham.
Anyone else?
Yes.
I should like to ask Graham a question.
What in your opinion were the influences that brought about your mental disorder?
And how can you be sure that they will not present themselves again?
Well, Sir...
I think if there's one thing I've learned above all else is that I can never be sure about anything ever again.
I looked for certainties in my youth.
I think they were all I could understand.
And they comforted me, I suppose.
But they also led me here.
I don't expect to be forgiven for what I've done.
I've taken life, I know.
Nothing can ever change that.
I'll always have to live with it.
But maybe, if you see fit, I could spend my life making up for it in some way.
And with the greatest respect, the best place to do that is probably not in here.
The Board has made their decision.
You're a free man.
Aren't you glad?
This is everything that we've worked for.
Who'll look after all this after I'm gone?
It'll all go to waste.
You've got more important things to do... out there.
You have to learn how to live.
I'm afraid.
It's a symptom of your recovery.
From now on your life will be a series of small triumphs, small failures.
Just like for all of us.
Where will I go?
God willing, you'll strike out on your own.
Maybe go to universities as we discussed.
Graham.
Look how far you've come.
Hasn't really changed much, has it?
Wait until you get inside.
It's... amazing.
I didn't know what size.
It's been so long!
That's perfect, Winnie.
Just what I wanted.
Sorry.
Its all I had time to get.
Didn't know what your interests were any more.
Now that you've stopped poisoning people.
We're gonna get to know each other all over again.
A new start.
New family.
This'll come in handy.
Oo my ciggies, lovely.
Smellies.
And a lighter!
Real onyx, Graham you shouldn't have!
This really is an embarrassment to richness.
Isn't it, Dennis?
Oh, yeah.
Thanks very much, Gra.
Yeah, it's very interesting ta.
Yeah, I shall read that.
Oh, and the piece de la resistance, for Rupert the beagle.
- What on earth is it?
- It's an ID tag.
Unscrew the top, I had to print it specially.
To whom it may concern, this is to certify that Rupert the beagle has undergone psychoanalysis and contrary to appearances is not suffering from hydrophobia, or any other canine psychosis.
Signed:
Sigmund Freud.
Are we having any tea?
Den you're joking, after all them chocolates?
I must say I'm feeling a little peckish too.
Oh, God, you two... honestly.
No, no, my turn.
I'll make some sandwiches, shall I?
- Cold turkey?
- No, it's all right mate, I--
Yeah, cold turkey sandwich be nice.
I told you...
- I told you.
- Shut up.
Ap.
Ap?
You want this?
Apple sauce?
You don't want apple sauce, it'll rot your teeth.
All right, just a taste.
You bastard!
You murdering bastard!
You fucking murdering bastard!
- What?
What's he done?
- Donna!
He was trying to poison Donna!
- No, I didn't.
I didn't touch her, honestly.
- She's 16 months old!
She's all I've got, she's all I've bloody got!
Best ring the hostel, hey Graham?
Maybe it'll be best if I run you back now, yeah?
Yes, yes, maybe it would.
I'm so sorry.
- You're here for the storekeeper's job?
- Yes.
Bloke just gone in got 3 "O" levels.
- Really?
- Fucking waste of time coming.
They'll be wanting nuclear scientists next.
Yes, yes indeed.
Next please?
Dear Doctor Zeigler:
You'll be happy to know that the Placement Officer at the Home Office has finally found me a job.
It's at a factory called Dudley and Hunter's.
Where they manufacture high-speed cameras and camera lenses.
I'm the new trainee store manager.
I suppose it's not quite the career I had in mind but it will at least give me a chance to find my feet.
Here, let me give you a hand with these, Edna.
Oh, you are a love.
You'll be doing me out of a job next.
My duties include general store keeping taking inventory and so on.
But I'm hoping that in time my true talents may be put to better use.
In the meantime I try to make myself as useful as I can.
Queen Mum for you Ray, and Douglas the Dog for you, right Nathan?
- So if you brought those two out here.
- There's another two.
All did not go quite as I hoped with my family.
And I had to find my own accommodation.
But life at work was a new and refreshing experience for me.
It's a very pleasant crowd of people here.
And most importantly, thanks to Home Office policy none of them have any knowledge of my former troubles.
- Yours is the antique car, right John?
- Yes, it is, thanks.
And the lovely lady for Debra.
Oh, will you just look at those hands!
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Don't know where they've been.
Oh, just look at them!
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
For the first time in my life I find that I'm accepted as part of a team.
With a clean slate as it were.
THE BEST GRANDAD IN THE WORLD.
I feel I really have a chance now to make life go my way.
And I know of course that it is you I have to thank for this opportunity.
I remain your loyal friend Graham Young.
Come on Deb.
Come on, Nathan!
Coming for a bevy?
I'm afraid I've a bit of work to catch up with.
Come on Graham.
Simon's driving ain't you, Simon?
Well, I dunno.
Give over whining Simon, we can all squeeze in.
What's the matter son?
You a bit boracic?
Go out and enjoy yourself.
Go on.
Give it to me back on payday.
Well go on!
You'll miss the boat!
2 Pounds 15 this round's just cost me.
It's not fair this round system.
The women on Bacardis.
Still, shan't be here much longer.
- Where are you going?
- Back to East Anglia.
I'm doing a PhD, Structural Inorganic Chemistry.
I'm just doing some lab work, to pay off my overdraft.
It's quite interesting, I suppose.
They're working on a camera that can take 6,000 pictures a second.
Is that the Maximage?
Hey, how do you know that?
It's meant to be top secret.
I work in stores, things come in and out.
Just put two and two together.
Why don't you pop around the lab tomorrow.
You can have a look at the "you know what".
I'd like that very much, thank you.
Listen, Graham, don't tell the others, but I'm slipping out the back.
I don't mind you, but I'm not giving this lot a lift home.
They never give you any petrol money.
Well, what do you think of a wet Tuesday night in Berkshire little Graham?
Not so bad, is it?
It's opened up a whole new vista.
Vista.
See?
What did I tell you, John?
I told you he was an artist.
Oi where's that Simon that sculked off to then?
I think he's just gone to the toilet.
Yeah, trying to slip out the back more like.
Yeah.
Well, he needn't bother.
I just took the rotor off his distributor.
Hey.
Are you looking?
Here you've got the mechanical elements.
You've got an incredibly powerful motorized taker that pulls the film through.
Now... there's no gate.
They couldn't find a shutter that works fast enough obviously.
So the film travels loose over this prism.
It's a beautiful system.
Now...
Here you've got a little problem...
Because the film plane is so far from the lens you've got to bend the light an incredible amount.
Here's what we use to do it.
An extraordinary little substance, really...
Here, are you concentrating?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
And indeed I had.
For there in front of me sat row upon row an old friend I hadn't seen for many years.
Thallium.
Was this some kind of trick by the Home Office?
To see if I would fall back into my old ways?
Or had it been an illusion?
Was I losing my mind?
I had to find out.
DANGER
Where are those bayonet mounts I asked you to get half an hour ago?
- Oh yes, bayonets.
- Yes, bayonets.
You deaf as well as daft?
Sorry Ray, I left them in the metal workshop.
"Sorry Ray, I left them in the metal workshop."
Dear, oh dear!
It's a good job your balls are in a bag.
Ray?
Ray?
Ray what's the matter?
I can't feel my fingers.
Hold on to him.
Billy?
Billy!
Billy!
Dennis, go get an ambulance.
Go on!
Graham, I was wondering if you fancied having lunch.
- There's this research...
- No, thanks Simon, I'm a little busy.
Are we feeling any better, Ray?
Is it just feeling sore, or is it more a stitch sort of thing?
Flaming Nora.
I've told you a thousand times, just leave us alone, will you?
I'll be fine!
Terrible news about Billy, isn't it, Debra?
Oh, yes, yes.
I was wondering if you would care to sign this get-well card.
NEED A LIFT?
Do they know what's wrong with him?
Some kind of stomach thing, I think.
Yes, but, do they know what caused it?
All that I know is that he's in hospital.
I wonder if it's the same thing Ray came down with.
Do you think there's a virus going around?
Look, I've got to get on, Graham.
Haven't you got any work to do?
God, Ray, are you all right?
I was going to ask you to sign this get-well card.
Now I don't suppose it's such a good...
Morning John, terrible news about Billy, isn't it?
Why are you always slooping around here, Graham?
You don't work in here, you work in the store room.
I was just getting Debra to sign this get-well card.
Yeah, well just keep your fairy fingers to yourself.
I beg your pardon, John?
There's something about you, Graham, I just don't like.
What are you saying, John?
I'm not saying anything.
Just get back down there, with the wooden tops, where you belong.
This time there would be no error.
Tasteless, colourless, odorless, untraceable.
The ultimate elixir.

As most of you will know, Billy and Ray have both been admitted to hospital.
Now, there seems to be a rumour that their illness is related to some kind of bug.
And may therefore be contagious.
I don't know who started this, but it simply isn't true.
I don't need to remind you that this company has a higly lucrative order due in Australia at the end of the month.
So I'm sure I can rely on you to put your hands to the pump your shoulders to the wheel and uh... so on.
Thank you.
Somebody said I was needed in stores.
Somebody want my body or something?
Hello?
Anyone here?
What's going on?
Nathan?
Graham?
For he's a jolly good fellow!
For he's a jolly good fellow!
For he's a jolly good fellow!
And so say all of us!
John, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the other day.
I was just trying to be friendly.
I would hate you to think that my intentions towards Debra were anything but entirely honourable.
Forget it son.
Thanks for the cake.
They make quite a couple, don't they?
If I could have your attention, please!
Please!
I'm sorry!
I've just received some devastating news.
Ray Braithwaite is dead.
John, control yourself!
He passed away at half past six this evening.
Hello?
This is Graham.
Graham Young.
I'm a friend of John's from work.
I just wanted to enquire about his health.
He's feeling very poorly I'm afraid.
Oh, dear.
Is he in much pain?
We had the doctor in a little while ago.
He says... he sees no improvement.
He's gonna have to have him admitted.
Has there been much vomiting and so forth?
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Well, I wish you strength.
Goodbye.
We've just heard about Billy.
He's gone.
Went in the middle of the night.
They say he was begging for a gun to shoot himself in the end.
John's in intensive care.
And Pete's wife phoned up to say he'd lost all his hair!
Looks like a three quarters plucked chicken, she says.
I don't want to lose my hair!
She's been ill too over the weekend.
There's talk now we may have some new kind of bubonic plague on our hands.
Well I'm going to scour out our every corner of that kitchen for starters.
No one's going to say Edna hadn't done her bit.
It's my hunch that there's some kind of dreadful mismanagement going on here.
It's the chemicals used to produce the lenses.
They can't afford to lose the Australian order and they will sacrifice as many workers as it takes to get it in on time.
You mark my words.
This health inspection is going to be a whitewash.
But if you believe this to be true, Graham, why haven't you told the authorities?
You should go to the police.
When I was a child I had a sort of breakdown.
My mother was killed in a terrible road accident.
They sent me to a home for treatment.
I made a complete recovery, of course.
No one here knows my medical history.
Once they know I was there, they could use me as their scape goat.
Blame me in some way.
It was a terrible place, Debra.
I don't think I could live another day if I thought they were going to send me back there.
Don't you worry, Graham.
Nobody's going to put you back in that hole.
Your secret's safe with me.
Well, we have some good news, and some bad news.
After extensive investigations I can happily say that everything here appears to be fine.
That's the good news.
The bad news is that it doesn't bring us any closer to understanding what this thing is.
It could be an as yet unexplained strain of influenza?
Could be a mini-plague?
Carried by fleas?
Could even be radioactivity from your nearby government airfield.
I'm just suggesting possibilities.
In the mean time, I have no reason to keep you from your work.
Have you considered heavy metal poisoning?
What makes you ask that?
Well, from what I've read on the Barchington Tribune...
Ray's symptoms and those of the other victims are constant with some form of metallic toxicity.
The convulsions, tachicardia, rapid onset of allopecia, ...blackening of the fingernails.
Discoloration of the skin around the nose and scrotum.
I'm anxious not to open this discussion up to idle speculation...
We'll look into it, meanwhile, back to work.
Thank you.
As the days went by, it became clearer and clearer that my life's work was nearing completion.
Soon I'd be able to bring the fruits of my labour to the world at large.
That Saturday morning all hands were on deck for the Australian order.
Seriously jeopardized by the spate of ill health.
Here I would put my final compound to the test.
Soon the ultimate weapon would be mine.
The final solution.
FUCK.
PAKIS OUT.
I'M BACKING BRITAIN.
Fuck!
Fuck!
I wish he'd hurry up with that tea, I'm parched.
I'll go see what's keeping him.
Graham, Edna, Debra, Darcy, Mark, Simon, Ron and Tom.
Graham, Edna, Debra, Darcy, Mark, Simon, Ron and Tom.
Come on, Graham.
They'll be frozen by the time--
I'm coming!
All right.
Don't forget the sugar there...
in the cupboard.
No, wait!
Tea's up!
The two in the left are sugared for Tom and Ron.
Look at these aren't they posh?
What happened to all our old mugs?
He had me chuck them all out, because of the disease.
No, not those.
They are for Tom and Mark.
I mean, Tom and Ron!
- I don't take sugar.
- Don't have one then.
No, no that!
That's for Simon!
And Ron.
I didn't want one without sugar.
- Oh, it has some sugar.
- No, it hasn't.
Put it back!
Come on, any one of these will do.
Hold on!
Hold on!
I'll sort this out!
That's fine.
No sugar.
Stop!
What's the matter, Graham?
It's him.
He's the disease.
It's been him all along.
He's been poisoning our mugs.
Give me one.
You stupid woman.
A DIAMOND IS FOREVER
FREED HARSHHURST MAN POISONS AGAIN
THE POISONER YOUR FRIENDLY FRANKENSTEIN WILL BE FREE
Now my story is nearly at an end.
And I wonder why it all went so horribly wrong for me.
Perhaps my step-mother was right.
Maybe I really did contaminate everything I touched.
I wonder if it could ever have been any different.
Are we destined to live the lives we do?
Or does the power of change lie within our grasp?
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
In the meantime I leave this handbook to those of you who are thinking of travelling in my path.
If you find yourself falling under the spell of poisons and their influence may it be of some use to you on that strange and fascinating journey.
Your humble servant:
Graham Young.
Dr. Ernest Zeigler, Psychiatric Counsellor
The Clairmont Old Age People's Home, Hawkhurst, Kent.
Graham Young was found dead in his prison cell on the 22nd of August 1990.
The cause of his death remains a mystery.
Move!
You know what?
One of these days.
I'm gonna go to that TV station in Buenos Aires and give myself in to Silvia Fernandez Barrios.
I'll tell her everything I've done.
But I won't name any names.
Cabeza. you don't know how to drive.
You played around with death.
my friend.
Tell me. you know the Turk?
That's fine. man.
I told you to stop screwing around with that. bro!
It's been blessed.
That's right.
What can I say?
They better think twice about it.
But I can tell you this:
Whoever touches her ass is gonna hear from me.
I swear to you.
That son of a bitch!
Take it easy. bro.
Calm down.
DEAD KING
Yo. bro.Juana's leaving.
Nobody gets away from Cabeza that easy.
Yeah!
To hell with that Juana.
I hope nobody tells Cabeza about this.
Gustavo. let's finish here and get the truck.
We gotta tell Cabeza.
- Is the Caribbean nice
- Beautiful.
- My boat's leaving tomorrow.
-Already
Everything's loaded.
We sail for the Caribbean.
- Is the Caribbean nice
- Beautiful.
A deep blue sea coral reefs... thick forests, palm trees and coconut trees.
Leave that woman alone.!
- Hurry up!
-All right, go.!
Go.!
Stop busting my balls.
Mom.
Don't stick your nose in this.
- Let's go.
- He's gonna kill her someday.
Poor woman has a scumbag for a husband.
It's almost full.
Take this.Juana.
Hurry.Juana.
SAVE YOUR SOUL
What are we gonna tell him?
What else can we do?
We have to let him know.
Get ready f or a real mess!
I knew this was gonna happen.
That's how things are.
You get to know a rooster in the fight.
A place f or everything and everything in its place.
Like that guy in Buenos Aires when the bomb went off.
My God. blood everywhere!
Never saw anything like it in my life.
And that reporter was in the middle of that mess.
You know the one I mean?
Silvia.
Silvia Fernandez Barrios.
Exactly.
She works as a reporter because that's her job.
And the guy comes up and touches her ass.
Complete lack of respect.
There's the dago.
What does he want here?
You go alone. then.
What's up. man?
Did you find her?
Yeah. with the kids.
Hold this. old man!
He's nuts.
Mom. it hasn't got any bullets.
You plan to take the kids?
Where the hell you think you're going?
How you doin'. my friend?
What's this?
For a ticket.
Just leave.
Go to hell!
Don't talk to me like that in front of the kids!
All the money I threw your way wasn't enough?
Some damn mother you are!
Get back to the house right now.
bef ore I kick your ass!
I'll finish you off.
and the kids and the dog too!
You think I won't?
I'll cut you open!
What happened?
I can't see.
What happened.Juanita?
What the hell happened?
Juana. help me!
Come help me!
Help me!
Bring the kids back!
Fuck. help me!
You fucked up my eye!
Oh. shit!
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
If I go across the border.
I'll bring you back some presents.
Did you take his eye out?
I don't know.
You think he's dead?
Come back.Juanita.
You fucked up my eye!
I forgive you.Juanita. I forgive you.
What if he comes back?
Let him come back if he wants.

Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1[ miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $5[ sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1[ dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
MORTAL KOMBAT
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
Is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- I trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- I won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- I won't.
- It's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you.
I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not.
I...
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
Is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks.
I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1[miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour...
I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- I shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay...
I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- I'm following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- I am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- I know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up.
I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now...
I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $5[sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do.
I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you...
I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care... of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1[dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home...
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
[GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
No, please.
[screaming]
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
[gasping]
Chan.
[THUNDER rumbling]
Let's go.
Sixty seconds to target.
-Jaxx, is the perimeter secured?
-Locked tight.
-lt better be. I want Kano.
-Trust me, Sonya.
I trust one person on this planet, Jaxx.
You're talking to her.
[BAND playing HEAVY METAL music]
[MEN GRUNTING]
[CHUCKLES]
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman.
Don't you, Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she's gonna follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
[laughing]
[GRUNTS]
Maybe me and Sonya should share a cabin have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano...
[SWITCHBLADE clicks] ...you're going to need a Seeing Eye dog.
[MEN GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
[ALL GRUNTING]
This is where you fall down.
[GRUNTS]
Where do you get these guys?
And the press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
Cut.
-All right, reset.
We're back in 1 5.
-l'm not doing it again.
-What do you mean?
-l'm not.
Johnny, it's the last shot.
Where are you going?
To my trailer.
I'm gonna get a gun and I'm gonna shoot myself for being in your movie.
It'll kill me. I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me, Johnny.
-l love you, I need you.
MAN:
Johnny.
Excuse me, Johnny, there's, uh, someone over there who wants to speak to you.
-Who is it?
-l don't really know.
You let somebody on the set you don't know?
No, of course not, I- lt had better not be a reporter.
-Oh, God, no, l--
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Hey, mister, you're in my chair.
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd, I--
I see the, uh, press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
Johnny, you're one of the best martial artists in the world.
And I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The best fighters in the world are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world that you're the real goods.
-So how do I, uh...?
-There's a boat.
It leaves Pier 40, Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
Liu.
LlU:
is this the place?
-Yes.
-This is where we found his body.
-What happened?
After you left for America, he followed in your footsteps preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather, it wasn't enough that you filled my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things, Grandfather.
-How can you, a wise man, believe this?
-We all believe in it.
Including your brother.
[BELL ringing]
[MONKS shouting INDISTINCTLY]
GRANDFATHER:
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the chosen one.
No.
He left our temple, turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the tournament.
For what reason?
LlU:
The man who killed my brother will be there.
MONK:
That cannot be your only reason for going.
-Or you will fail.
-Oh, yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
MAN:
That's why you left the temple and ran away, isn't it?
The great tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your god of thunder and lightning.
He's just a beggar.
Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So you're going to win the tournament?
-Yes, I am.
-Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of a simple beggar?
[LIU GRUNTS]
If you are Rayden why did you let Chan die?
-Why didn't you protect him?
-Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'm going to find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
[ALL muttering]
He isn't ready, my lord.
-And we've lost so much time.
-l know.
But there is no one else.
[MAN speaking INDlSTlNCTLY OVER LOUDSPEAKER]
-Oh, give me a break.
-Hey.
-Look, don't let them get to you.
JOHNNY:
Yeah, sure.
Hey, you're Art Lean, aren't you?
Man, I saw you fight in London, you were great.
Thanks.
I saw a couple of your films.
-Listen, you can't fake those moves.
-Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Hey, pal, when the ship comes in, could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
Yeah. I pay money, you carry the bags.
-Or is that too complicated?
-No.
-l got it.
-Good.
Huh.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying his ass off.
Kano could be a thousand miles from here by now.
What is that?
You gotta be kidding me.
-That's him.
-Hold on.
KANO:
That's it, baby.
Come to papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya.
Hey, you.
All right, tough guy, you wanna get...rough?
No, do you?
Hi. I'm Johnny Cage, and you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
-But I'm sure I can help you find him.
-Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
It's an honor to finally meet you, Sonya.
Shang Tsung, at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour, I'd love to give it to you myself.
Hey, be nice to the lady.
She's just doing her job.
When I want backup, I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero, deadliest of enemies.
But slaves under my power.
Move aside.
[SQUEALING]
-Enough.
TSUNG:
Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament.
-As your emperor well knows.
-My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
-Hmm.
I shall see to that.
TSUNG:
Of course.
Until we reach the island, where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
-Thank you.
-What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
JOHNNY:
We got a guy with things coming out of his hand another guy who freezes stuff.
And then a man who, as far as I can tell, is made out of electricity.
I mean, how did he disappear like that?
What is going on?
Who is this guy?
Let's just think this through.
There is a rational explanation for this.
He's Rayden.
God of lightning and protector of the realm of Earth.
-Oh, great.
-There's your rational explanation.
RAYDEN:
Listen.
What you're about to face is vastly more important than your ego your enemy or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the realm of Earth in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful, then why doesn't he just invade us?
To enter the realm of Earth the emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung, and his warriors have to win 1 0 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
Heh.
They have won nine.
This will be the 1 0th tournament.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are gonna save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat is not about death, but life.
Mortal men and women defending your own world.
Why are you telling us all this?
-What about the others?
-They are all great fighters.
But I have looked into their souls.
And yours.
One of you three will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate of billions will depend upon you.
[laughing]
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now, you will lose your life and your soul.
He is gonna pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look. it has begun.
It has begun.
SONYA:
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
[RADIO STATIC]
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, why don't you call my agent?
Do I look like your secretary?
[YELLS]
What are you doing?
That electrical disturbance must have blown out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
-Do I look like your travel agent?
-Fine.
Okay. I give up.
-What's going on?
-l don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
LlU:
Do you need help with those?
[JOHNNY panting]
Ah, ha, ha.
Ah, no more steps.
Oh, great.
Can't wait to see what the bathrooms look like.
You know, when a woman looks at you like that it usually means something.
TSUNG:
Princess Kitana.
She's a most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
[SQUEALING]
[MEN SHOUT]
TSUNG:
Welcome.
You're here to compete in Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some of you will even have the distinct honor and pleasure to face Prince Goro, our reigning champion.
You are all witnesses to one of the greatest turning points in the history of your planet.
Treasure these moments as if they were your last.
And now, for a taste of things to come.
[ALL shouting]
[YELLS]
[JOINTS cracking]
[GROANS]
[GRUNTlNG]
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
-Hey, where are you going?
-After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Don't you remember what Rayden said?
Yeah, well, he didn't say anything to me.
Shang Tsung knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you gotta admire her.
When she sets her mind on something....
It's not her mind you're admiring.
It's true.
[grumbling]
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it, it's a guy thing.
-Hey, where are you going?
-l'm following him.
-l work alone.
-No, Shang Tsung is mine.
JOHNNY:
Why don't we forget about Shang Tsung?
What do you mean, "forget about him"?
Did you see what happened back there?
-l wanna get to the bottom of this.
JOHNNY:
Are you out of your mind?
[ROARING]
Sonya.
You go ahead, find out what that was.
-Liu and I will wait right here.
-What?
Mm!
See, me, I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man, hand-to-hand.
Just like my daddy taught me.
But what I saw out there was not very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
So then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Heh.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I wanna know, if this Shang Tsung guy is so great how come he's got such a crummy-looking boat?
Hmm?
Eh.
Anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
Heh.
"Treasure these moments."
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power become his slaves.
Yeah?
Well, I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool.
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the emperor himself.
-You're some kind of royalty too, right?
GORO:
I am Goro.
General of the armies of Outworld and prince of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that?
Something like underground?
Yes, something like that.
Yeah?
Well, I'm kind of an underworld boss myself, you know.
-Hmm.
-Well, I mean, back home.
How lucky for them back home.
-lt's true, Prince Goro.
-Hmm?
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable-looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity, no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth, men like him can amass great wealth and almost godlike power.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
-Now, when do I get paid?
-After you've fought the girl.
But remember, she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
I've come to warn you that Kung Lao's descendent is competing in the tournament.
You must handle him carefully.
I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to absolute victory which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
-Princess Kitana.
-The emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 1 0,000 years old and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
But she must not be allowed to join with the forces from the realm of Earth.
Especially Liu Kang.
-What's so special about you?
-l don't know.
The emperor will not tolerate failure.
And neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
[PEBBLES FALLING]
-What?
What is it?
-Huh?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look.
That has to be Princess Kitana.
-l think she's trying to help us.
-You're hard up for a date.
-She's trying to lead us out.
-Forget about her, she's 1 0,000 years old.
-So what?
-Liu.
Liu?
Liu.
[SCRAPING]
[SCREAMS]
[SQUEALING]
-Liu, what happened?
-There's something here.
-l think it's following Princess Kitana.
-Where is she?
I don't know.
LlU:
Do you know where we're going?
-l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
[MEN GRUNT]
-We got company.
-l know.
[ALL shouting]
[ALL GRUNTING]
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
-Piece of cake.
-Piece of cake, huh?
-Well, it was easy for me.
-Oh, get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing, they're not.
What more do you want?
[SLOW CLAPPING]
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So why don't you show me what you plan to do about them?
[ALL SHOUT]
Ah, ah.
I don't think so.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
So now you've seen what you'll be facing in the tournament.
-You mean Goro?
-And Shang Tsung.
-Will Shang Tsung fight in the tournament?
-lf he chooses to.
As a former champion, he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung is to face not one, but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on, my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang, you will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
[GRUNTS]
MAN 1 :
Come on.
MAN 2:
Yeah.
[BOTH shouting]
[BOTH grunting]
Your soul is mine.
FIGHTER:
No!
[SCREAMS]
Fatality.
Hyah.
Sonya Blade.
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
[laughing]
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
[laughing]
Ooh.
Now, look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, now, doesn't it?
What?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
No, it put a big smile on your partner though.
Ear...
[whistles] ...to ear.
[CHUCKLES]
[YELLS]
Give it up, baby.
-l've studied all your moves.
-Yeah?
Study this.
[BOTH grunting]
[GROANING]
Does it hurt, baby?
Yes.
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't.
-Oh, give me a break.
-Okay.
[BONES CRUNCH]
[CROWD BOOING]
Get over here.
[SQUEALING]
Come here.
Welcome.
[BOTH grunting]
Get down here.
[YELLING]
[screaming]
[BOTH YELLING]
TSUNG:
Begin.
[BOTH grunting]
If you won't fight with all of your heart, there is no hope.
LlU:
Why do you care if I win or lose?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
-What?
-Kitana.
Remember my words.
TSUNG:
Kitana, that's enough.
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
[BOTH grunting]
[YELLS]
KlTANA:
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
[GORO ROARING AND CROWD CHEERING]
[ROARING]
[GRUNTlNG]
What the--?
[cracking]
[ROARS]
[GORO LAUGHS]
-Yeah, that's it, in and out.
LlU:
Come on.
[ROARS]
Yeah!
Goro!
-Come on, Art.
You can do it.
Come on.
-Make your move, Art.
Use your feet.
SONYA:
That's right, use the kick.
-Ugh!
[GRUNTlNG]
JOHNNY:
Come on, Art.
Get up.
[ROARING]
Yeah!
Kill him, smash him!
Get out.
Get out.
[ROARS]
Yeah!
Goro!
Finish him.
Time to die.
Finish him.
[ROARING]
No!
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine.
No!
SONYA:
We can't win now.
How could we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you your own fear.
So who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight bravely enough but foolishly, carelessly and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust you will lose.
Wait.
-What about me?
-Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled it once when you went to America.
It has brought you guilt for the death of your brother.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
No.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
-l tried.
-Despair is the most dangerous fear of all.
I know this, and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul and use the fear he sees there against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
SONYA:
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
Well, if I don't, then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now, I can finish this.
You're making this all sound really simple, and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
Because I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I got a plan.
Oh, I can't believe this.
You are the most egotistical, self-deluded person I have ever met.
Yeah?
Well, you forgot good-looking.
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who's gonna die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends, but make no mistake.
They too will die after Goro destroys you.
So, what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return, I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself or another of my choosing in a place designated by me for the final battle of the tournament.
-You got it, pal.
-l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's-
- How do you say?
A deal's a deal.
-What have you done?
-l made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
[CHANTING] Goro, Goro, Goro.
[ROARING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
-Get him!
-Goro!
[CHANTING] Goro, Goro, Goro.
[laughing]
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
All right.
Let's dance.
[ROARING]
[GROANING]
Yes.
Ha-ha-ha!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
CROWD [chanting]:
Finish him, finish him, finish him.
Yeah!
Goro!
Finish him, finish him, finish him.
[GORO ROARING]
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
[YELLING]
This is where you fall down.
[screaming]
SONYA:
No!
No!
Let me go!
Aah!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
-Stand and fight.
-We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply changing the place as we agreed.
SONYA:
No!
-Sonya!
-No!
-Where's he taken her?
-To the emperor's castle in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden, can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
No.
I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?
-There is one last rule.
He neglected to mention it.
She has to accept the challenge or there can be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
JOHNNY:
You sure you don't wanna go with us?
RAYDEN:
In Outworld, if you look hard enough, you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So this is Outworld, huh?
Well, I can see why they want a change of scenery.
LlU:
We should head for that tower.
Shang Tsung would have taken Sonya there.
Liu, I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you, I hate it.
I'm in a hostile environment, I am completely unprepared.
I'm surrounded by people who probably wanna kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school.
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
[SQUEALING]
[BOTH YELLING AND GRUNTING]
LlU:
Oh, no, you don't.
[YELLS]
KlTANA:
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
LlU:
What happened here?
KlTANA:
The same thing that will happen to your world unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld.
Then his best warriors lost 1 0 Mortal Kombats and the emperor entered the realm, killed my parents and adopted me to lay claim to the throne.
It was beautiful once before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I possibly stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you, Liu Kang, I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower, you will face three challenges:
You must face your enemy, you must face yourself and you must face your worst fear.
[DOOR opening]
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
Sonya.
My sweet Sonya.
There is no one else.
If you don't fight the realm of Earth will forfeit the tournament and its portals will open to our great emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched, really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
-Seize them.
-Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament and betray our emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose for all time the keys to the realm of Earth.
Very well.
Johnny Cage, I challenge you.
No, you'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care of this impudent mortal myself.
-Nice dress.
-Ugh.
[BOTH YELLING AND GRUNTING]
You fool.
[DRONlNG]
What's that sound?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of a thousand dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
[ALL yelling AND grunting]
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang.
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul, but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died and you promised that you would always take care of me?
I remember.
Now it's my turn to take care of you, brother.
Liu, come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
No.
It wasn't my fault.
-Brother.
-No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
[BOTH grunting]
The chosen one.
I am the chosen one.
[GHOSTLY VOICES MUTTERING]
-You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
VOICE 1:
Finish him.
VOICE 2:
Finish him!
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
[BOTH GRUNT]
All those souls, and you still don't have one of your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender. lt's over.
[GROANING]
[YELLING]
Never!
[YELLING]
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day, we will be reunited.
But until then, my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home.
[cheering]
RAYDEN:
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
[laughing]
I've got to tell you something, you guys did great.
evil VOICE:
Bow to me.
What is it?
The emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.

"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
ThE EnD
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
Is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- I trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- I won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- I won't.
- It's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you.
I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not.
I...
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
Is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks.
I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour...
I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- I shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay...
I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- I'm following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- I am Goro!
General of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- I know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up.
I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now...
I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking. "
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal. "
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do.
I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
But it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you...
I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care... of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home...
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
No, please.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
Let's go.
Sixty seconds to target.
- Jaxx, is the perimeter secured?
- Locked tight.
- It better be.
I want Kano.
- Trust me, Sonya.
I trust one person on this planet, Jaxx.
You're talking to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman.
Don't you, Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she's gonna follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Maybe me and Sonya should share a cabin have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano you're going to need a Seeing Eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
And the press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
Cut.
- All right, reset.
We're back in 15.
- I'm not doing it again.
- What do you mean?
- I'm not.
Johnny, it's the last shot.
Where are you going?
To my trailer.
I'm gonna get a gun and I'm gonna shoot myself for being in your movie.
It'll kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me, Johnny.
- I love you, I need you.
Johnny.
Excuse me, Johnny, there's, uh, someone over there who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.
You let somebody on the set you don't know?
No, of course not, I-
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh, God, no, I-
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Hey, mister, you're in my chair.
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd, I-
I see the, uh, press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
Johnny, you're one of the best martial artists in the world.
And I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The best fighters in the world are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world that you're the real goods.
- So how do I, uh...?
- There's a boat.
It leaves Pier 40, Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
Liu.
Is this the place?
- Yes.
- This is where we found his body.
- What happened?
After you left for America, he followed in your footsteps preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather, it wasn't enough that you filled my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things, Grandfather.
- How can you, a wise man, believe this?
- We all believe in it.
Including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the chosen one.
No.
He left our temple, turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the tournament.
For what reason?
The man who killed my brother will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going.
- Or you will fail.
- Oh, yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple and ran away, isn't it?
The great tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your god of thunder and lightning.
He's just a beggar.
Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'm going to find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my lord.
- And we've lost so much time.
- I know.
But there is no one else.
- Oh, give me a break.
- Hey.
- Look, don't let them get to you.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, you're Art Lean, aren't you?
Man, I saw you fight in London, you were great.
Thanks.
I saw a couple of your films.
- Listen, you can't fake those moves.
- Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Hey, pal, when the ship comes in, could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
Yeah.
I pay money, you carry the bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
- I got it.
- Good.
Huh.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying his ass off.
Kano could be a thousand miles from here by now.
What is that?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That's him.
- Hold on.
That's it, baby.
Come to papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya.
Hey, you.
All right, tough guy, you wanna get... rough?
No, do you?
Hi.
I'm Johnny Cage, and you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
- But I'm sure I can help you find him.
- Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
It's an honor to finally meet you, Sonya.
Shang Tsung, at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour, I'd love to give it to you myself.
Hey, be nice to the lady.
She's just doing her job.
When I want backup, I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero, deadliest of enemies.
But slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament.
- As your emperor well knows.
- My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- Hmm.
I shall see to that.
Of course.
Until we reach the island, where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
We got a guy with things coming out of his hand another guy who freezes stuff.
And then a man who, as far as I can tell, is made out of electricity.
I mean, how did he disappear like that?
What is going on?
Who is this guy?
Let's just think this through.
There is a rational explanation for this.
He's Rayden.
God of lightning and protector of the realm of Earth.
- Oh, great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is vastly more important than your ego your enemy or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the realm of Earth in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful, then why doesn't he just invade us?
To enter the realm of Earth the emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung, and his warriors have to win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
Heh.
They have won nine.
This will be the 1 Oth tournament.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are gonna save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat is not about death, but life.
Mortal men and women defending your own world.
Why are you telling us all this?
- What about the others?
- They are all great fighters.
But I have looked into their souls.
And yours.
One of you three will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now, you will lose your life and your soul.
He is gonna pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, why don't you call my agent?
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
That electrical disturbance must have blown out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay.
I give up.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, ha, ha.
Ah, no more steps.
Oh, great.
Can't wait to see what the bathrooms look like.
You know, when a woman looks at you like that it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's a most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some of you will even have the distinct honor and pleasure to face Prince Goro, our reigning champion.
You are all witnesses to one of the greatest turning points in the history of your planet.
Treasure these moments as if they were your last.
And now, for a taste of things to come.
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Hey, where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Don't you remember what Rayden said?
Yeah, well, he didn't say anything to me.
Shang Tsung knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you gotta admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It's not her mind you're admiring.
It's true.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it, it's a guy thing.
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Why don't we forget about Shang Tsung?
What do you mean, "forget about him"?
Did you see what happened back there?
- I wanna get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya.
You go ahead, find out what that was.
- Liu and I will wait right here.
- What?
Mm!
See, me, I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man, hand-to-hand.
Just like my daddy taught me.
But what I saw out there was not very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
So then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Heh.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I wanna know, if this Shang Tsung guy is so great how come he's got such a crummy-looking boat?
Hmm?
Eh.
Anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
Heh.
"Treasure these moments. "
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power become his slaves.
Yeah?
Well, I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool.
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the emperor himself.
- You're some kind of royalty too, right?
I am Goro.
General of the armies of Outworld and prince of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that?
Something like underground?
Yes, something like that.
Yeah?
Well, I'm kind of an underworld boss myself, you know.
- Hmm.
- Well, I mean, back home.
How lucky for them back home.
- It's true, Prince Goro.
- Hmm?
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable-looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity, no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth, men like him can amass great wealth and almost godlike power.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
- Now, when do I get paid?
- After you've fought the girl.
But remember, she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
I've come to warn you that Kung Lao's descendent is competing in the tournament.
You must handle him carefully.
I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to absolute victory which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
- Princess Kitana.
- The emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
But she must not be allowed to join with the forces from the realm of Earth.
Especially Liu Kang.
- What's so special about you?
- I don't know.
The emperor will not tolerate failure.
And neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
- What?
What is it?
- Huh?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look.
That has to be Princess Kitana.
- I think she's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- She's trying to lead us out.
- Forget about her, she's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu.
Liu?
Liu.
- Liu, what happened?
- There's something here.
- I think it's following Princess Kitana.
- Where is she?
I don't know.
Do you know where we're going?
- I know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
- We got company.
- I know.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Oh, get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing, they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So why don't you show me what you plan to do about them?
Ah, ah.
I don't think so.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
So now you've seen what you'll be facing in the tournament.
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will Shang Tsung fight in the tournament?
- If he chooses to.
As a former champion, he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung is to face not one, but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on, my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang, you will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
Come on.
Yeah.
Your soul is mine.
No!
Fatality.
Hyah.
Sonya Blade.
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Ooh.
Now, look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, now, doesn't it?
What?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
No, it put a big smile on your partner though.
Ear to ear.
Give it up, baby.
- I've studied all your moves.
- Yeah?
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Yes.
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't.
- Oh, give me a break.
- Okay.
Get over here.
Come here.
Welcome.
Get down here.
Begin.
If you won't fight with all of your heart, there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win or lose?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
- What?
- Kitana.
Remember my words.
Kitana, that's enough.
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the-?
- Yeah, that's it, in and out.
Come on.
Yeah!
Goro!
- Come on, Art.
You can do it.
Come on.
- Make your move, Art.
Use your feet.
That's right, use the kick.
- Ugh!
Come on, Art.
Get up.
Yeah!
Kill him, smash him!
Get out.
Get out.
Yeah!
Goro!
Finish him.
Time to die.
Finish him.
No!
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine.
No!
We can't win now.
How could we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you your own fear.
So who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight bravely enough but foolishly, carelessly and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
- What about me?
- Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled it once when you went to America.
It has brought you guilt for the death of your brother.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
No.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
- I tried.
- Despair is the most dangerous fear of all.
I know this, and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul and use the fear he sees there against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
Well, if I don't, then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now, I can finish this.
You're making this all sound really simple, and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
Because I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I got a plan.
Oh, I can't believe this.
You are the most egotistical, self-deluded person I have ever met.
Yeah?
Well, you forgot good-looking.
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who's gonna die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends, but make no mistake.
They too will die after Goro destroys you.
So, what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return, I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself or another of my choosing in a place designated by me for the final battle of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's
- How do you say?
A deal's a deal.
- What have you done?
- I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro, Goro, Goro.
- Get him!
- Goro!
Goro, Goro, Goro.
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
All right.
Let's dance.
Yes.
Ha-ha-ha!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
Finish him, finish him, finish him.
Yeah!
Goro!
Finish him, finish him, finish him.
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
No!
No!
Let me go!
Aah!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
- Stand and fight.
- We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply changing the place as we agreed.
No!
- Sonya!
- No!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the emperor's castle in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden, can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
No.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- There is one last rule.
He neglected to mention it.
She has to accept the challenge or there can be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't wanna go with us?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough, you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So this is Outworld, huh?
Well, I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
Shang Tsung would have taken Sonya there.
Liu, I hate this place.
I do.
I'm telling you, I hate it.
I'm in a hostile environment, I am completely unprepared.
I'm surrounded by people who probably wanna kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school.
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld.
Then his best warriors lost 10 Mortal Kombats and the emperor entered the realm, killed my parents and adopted me to lay claim to the throne.
It was beautiful once before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I possibly stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you, Liu Kang, I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower, you will face three challenges:
You must face your enemy, you must face yourself and you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
Sonya.
My sweet Sonya.
There is no one else.
If you don't fight the realm of Earth will forfeit the tournament and its portals will open to our great emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched, really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament and betray our emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose for all time the keys to the realm of Earth.
Very well.
Johnny Cage, I challenge you.
No, you'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care of this impudent mortal myself.
- Nice dress.
- Ugh.
You fool.
What's that sound?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of a thousand dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang.
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul, but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died and you promised that you would always take care of me?
I remember.
Now it's my turn to take care of you, brother.
Liu, come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
No.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The chosen one.
I am the chosen one.
- You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
Finish him.
Finish him!
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you still don't have one of your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender.
It's over.
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day, we will be reunited.
But until then, my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home.
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I've got to tell you something, you guys did great.
Bow to me.
What is it?
The emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Storm's coming.
And you boys?
Your daddy?
You are smack in the middle of it.
Take your brother outside as fast as you can!
Now, Dean!
Go!
He wants us to pick up where he left off.
Saving people, hunting things...
The family business.
Our whole lives have been searching for this demon.
Samuel Colt made a gun.
They say this gun can kill anything.
We finally know who this demon's gonna be,
And now, we know how to kill it.
More and more demons are walking among us.
You're not my dad.
Dean, what the hell's going on?
I think he's possessed.
My plans for you, Sammy...
You, and all the children like you.
It's inside me.
I can feel it.
Shoot me!
I can't hold on to it much longer!
Why didn't you kill it?
We still got the colt.
We still have the one bullet left.
Get back
Or I'll kill you.
I swear to god.
You won't.
You're saving that bullet for someone else.
You want to bet?
Oh, my god!
Dad...
Did I do this?
Dad...
Dean...
Significant passenger, space intrusion.
Unresponsive.
B.P. 180 over 50.
B.P. 100 over 15.
Heartbeat 95.
Tell me if they're okay!
You have to stay still.
Are they even alive!
Sam?
Dad?
Anybody?
!
Shadow county, nurses' station.
How can I transfer your call?
Of course.
I transfer your call.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I, uh...
I think I was in a car accident with my...
Dad and my brother.
I just need to find them.
Hello?
Sammy...
You look good...
Considering...
Man, tell me you can hear me.
How's dad?
Is he okay?
Come on, you're the psychic.
Give me some ghost whispering or something.
Your father's awake.
You can go see him if you like.
Oh, thank god.
Doc, what about my brother?
Well, he sustained serious injury.
Blood loss, contusions to his liver and kidney.
But it's the head trauma I'm worried about.
There's early signs of cerebral edema.
Well, what can we do?
Well, we won't know his full condition until he wakes up.
If,
He wakes up.
If?
I have to be honest.
Screw you, doc I'm waking up!
Most people with his degree of injury wouldn't have survived this long.
He's fighting very hard.
But you need to have realistic expectations, son.
Come on, Sam.
Go find some hoodoo priest to lay some mojo on me.
I'll be fine.
Sam?
All right.
Here.
Give them my insurance.
Elroy Mcgillicuddy?
And his two loving sons.
So...
What else did the doctor say about Dean?
N othing.
Look...
If the doctors won't do anything,
Then we'll have to, that's all.
I don't know.
I'll find some...
Hoodoo priest and lay some mojo on him.
We'll look for someone.
Yeah.
But, Sam...
I don't know if we're gonna find anyone.
Why not?
I found that faith healer before.
That was one in a million.
So what?
We just sit here with our thumbs up our ass?
No, I said we'd look.
All right?
I'll check under every stone.
Where's the colt?
Your son is dying,
And you're worried about the colt?
We are hunting
This demon, and maybe it's hunting us too.
That gun may be our only card.
It's in the trunk.
They dragged the car to a yard off of i-83.
All right, you got to clean out that trunk before some junk man sees what's inside.
I already called Bobby.
He's like an hour out.
He's gonna tow the Impala back to his place.
All right.
You,
You go meet up with Bobby.
You get that colt and bring it back to me.
And you watch out for hospital security.
I think I got it covered.
Hey.
Here.
I made a list of things I need
That Bobby pick them up for me.
Acacia?
Oil of Abramelin?
What's this stuff for?
Protection.
Hey, dad...
You know the demon?
He said he had plans for me and children like me.
You have any idea what he meant by that?
No, I don't.
Well, you sure know something.
Oh, man.
Dean is gonna be pissed.
Look, Sam, this...
This just ain't worth a tow.
I say we empty the trunk, and sell the rest for scrap.
No.
Dean would kill me if we did that.
When he gets better, he's gonna want to fix this.
There's nothing to fix.
The frame's a pretzel.
The engine's ruined.
There's barely any parts worth salvaging.
Listen to me, Bobby.
If there's only one working part, that's enough.
We're not just gonna give up on...
Okay.
You got it.
Here...
Dad asked if you could get this stuff for him.
What John want with this?
Protection from the demon.
What?
Nothing.
It's just...
Bobby.
What's going on?
Come on, dad.
You got to help me.
I got to get better.
I got to get back in there.
I mean, you haven't called a soul for help.
You haven't even tried.
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Aren't you gonna even say anything?
!
I've done everything you have ever asked me.
Everything.
I've given everything I've ever had.
Now you're just gonna sit there?
You're gonna watch me die?
I mean, what the hell kind of father are you?
!
What is that?
I take it you didn't see that.
Hey!
I need some help in here!
I can't...
Breathe.
Sammy, tell me you can freaking hear me, man.
There's something in the hospital.
Now, you got to bring me back, and we got to hunt this thing.
Sam!
You're quiet.
You think I wouldn't find out?
What are you talking about?
That stuff from Bobby.
You don't use it to ward off a demon.
You use it to summon one.
You're planning on bringing the demon here, aren't you?
Having some stupid macho showdown!
I have a plan, Sam.
That's exactly my point!
Dean is dying, and you have a plan!
You know what?
!
You care more about
Killing this demon than you do saving your own son!
No, no, no.
Guys, don't do this!
Do not tell me how I feel!
I am doing this for Dean.
How?
How is revenge gonna help him?
You're not thinking about anybody but yourself!
It's the same selfish obsession!
Come on, guys, don't do this!
That's funny,
I thought this was your obsession too.
This demon
Killed your mother,
Killed your girlfriend.
You begged me to be part of this hunt!
Now, if you killed that damn thing when you had the chance,
None of this would have happened.
It was possessing you, dad!
I would have killed you, too!
Yeah,
And your brother would be awake right now.
Shut up, both of you!
Go to hell.
I should have never taken you along in the first place.
I knew it was a mistake.
I said "shut up!"
Dude, I full-On swayzed that mother.
What is it?
Something's going on out there.
All clear?
Clear.
Still no pulse.
No.
Still no pulse.
Okay, let's go again. 360.
Charging.
All clear?
Clear.
Come on, come on...
Still no pulse.
Clear.
Still nothing.
Okay, let's go again.
Charging.
All clear?
Get the hell away from me.
Stay back!
There's no change.
Starting cpr.
I said get back!
Still nothing.
We have a pulse.
We're back into sinus rhythm.
Don't worry, Sammy.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm getting that thing before it gets me.
It's some kind of spirit,
But I could grab it.
And if I can grab it,
I can kill it.
Can't you see me?
!
Why won't you look at me?
!
Now what?
Somebody talk to me!
Say something, please!
Can you see me?
Yeah.
All right, just calm down.
What's your name?
Tessa.
Okay, good, Tessa.
I'm Dean.
What's happening to me?
Am I...
Am I dead?
That sort of depends.
I don't understand.
I just came in for an appendectomy.
I hate to bear bad news, but...
I think there were some complications.
It's just a dream, that's all.
This is just
A very weird,
Unbelievably vivid dream.
Tessa,
It's not a dream.
Then what else could it be?
You ever heard of an out-Of-Body experience?
What are you, some new-Agey guy?
You see me messing with crystals or listening to Yanni?
It's actually a very old idea.
It's got a lot of different names.
Bilocation,
Crisis apparitions, fetches.
I think it's happening to us.
If it is...
It means that we're spirits...
Of people close to death.
So we're gonna die?
No.
Not if we hold on.
Our bodies can get better.
You can snap right back in there and wake up.
What do you mean you felt something?
I mean, it felt like...
Like Dean.
Like he was there, just out of eyeshot or something.
I don't know if it's my psychic thing or what.
But do you think it's even possible?
Do you think his spirit could be around?
Anything's possible.
Well, there's one way to find out.
Where are you going?
I got to
Pick something up.
I'll be back.
Wait, Sam.
I promise
I won't hunt this demon.
Not until we know Dean's okay.
I got to say, I'm impressed.
With what?
You.
Most people in your spot would be jello by now, but
You're taking this pretty well.
Maybe a little better than me.
Don't get me wrong,
I was pretty freaked at first.
But
Now I don't know.
Maybe I'm dealing.
So you're okay with dying?
No, of course not.
I just think whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen.
It's out of my control.
It's just...
Fate.
That's crap.
You always have a choice.
You can either roll over and die, you can keep fighting no matter what...
Room 237.
Code blue.
Dr. Christie
Dean, where are you going?
Just wait here.
Give me another amp oepi, please.
Get away from her!
Still nothing.
All right.
Let's call it.
Time of death... 5:11 p.M.
At least she's not suffering anymore.
Hey.
I think maybe you're around.
And if you are,
Don't make fun of me for this,
But, um...
But there's one way we can talk.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dean?
Dean, are you here?
God, I feel like I'm at a slumber party.
All right, Sam.
This isn't gonna work.
I'll be damned.
Oh, it's good to hear from you, man.
It hasn't been the same without you, Dean.
Damn straight.
All right.
Dean, what?
" H"...
"U"...
"Hunt"?
What, "hunting"?
Are you hunting?
Dean, it's in the hospital, what you're hunting?
Do you know what it is?
One question at a time, dude.
What is it?
I don't think it's killing people.
I think it's taking them...
You know, when...
When their time is just up.
A reaper...
Is it after you?
If it's here naturally,
There's no way to stop it.
Yeah, you can't kill death.
Man, you're, uh...
I'm screwed, Sam.
No.
No, no, no.
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a way.
Dad will know what to do.
Dad?
Hey, so dad wasn't in his room.
Where is he?
But I got dad's journal, so...
Who knows?
Maybe there's something in here.
Thanks for not giving up on me, Sammy.
Son of a bitch.
Hi, Dean.
You know, you read the most interesting things.
For example, did you know that reapers
Can alter human perception?
I sure didn't.
Basically they can make themselves appear however they want...
Like, say...
A pretty girl.
You're much prettier than the last reaper I met.
I was wondering when you'd figure it out.
I should have known.
That whole "accepting fate" rap of yours is far too laid-Back for a dead chick.
But, you know, the mother and the body...
I'm still trying to figure that one out.
It's my sandbox.
I can make you see whatever I want.
What is this, like a turn-On for you, huh?
Toying with me?
You didn't give me much choice.
You saw my true form, and you flipped out.
Kind of hurts a girl's feelings.
This was the only way I could get you to talk to me.
Okay, fine.
We're talking.
What the hell do you want to talk about?
How death is nothing to fear.
It's your time to go, Dean.
And you're living on borrowed time already.
What the hell are you doing down here, buddy?
I can explain.
Yeah?
You're gonna explain to security.
Come on.
You follow me.
Hey.
How stupid you think I am?
You really want an honest answer to that?
You conjuring me, John?
I'm surprised.
I took you for a lot of things,
But suicidally reckless wasn't one of them.
I can always shoot you.
You could always miss.
And you only got one try, don't you?
Did you
Really think you could trap me?
Oh, I don't want to trap you.
I want to make a deal.
Dean, are you here?
Couldn't find anything in the book.
I don't know how to help you.
But I'll keep trying, all right?
As long as you keep fighting.
I mean, come on, you can't...
You can't leave me here alone with dad.
We'll kill each other.
You know that.
Dean, you got to hold on.
You can't go, man, not now.
We were just starting to be brothers again.
Can you hear me?
Look, I'm sure you've heard this before, but...
You got to make an exception.
You got to cut me a break.
Stage 3...
Bargaining.
I'm serious.
My family is in danger.
See, we're kind of in the middle of this, uh...
War.
And they need me.
The fight's over.
No, it isn't.
It is for you.
Dean...
You're not the first soldier I've plucked from the field.
They all feel the same.
They can't leave.
Victory hangs in the balance.
But they're wrong.
The battle goes on without them.
My brother,
He could die without me.
Maybe he will.
Maybe he won't.
Nothing you can do about it.
It's an honorable death,
A warrior's death.
I think I'll pass on the 72 virgins, thanks.
I'm not that into prude chicks anyway.
That's funny.
You're very cute.
There's no such thing as an honorable death.
My corpse is gonna rot in the ground, and my family is gonna die.
No.
I'm not going with you.
I don't care what you do.
Well,
Like you said...
There's always a choice.
I can't make you come with me.
But,
You're not getting back in your body.
And that's just facts.
So, yes,
You can stay.
You'll stay here for years...
Disembodied.
Scared.
And over the decades, it'll probably drive you mad.
Maybe you'll even get violent.
What are you saying?
How do you think angry spirits are born?
They can't let go,
And they can't move on.
And you're about to become one.
The same thing you hunt.
It's very unsinly,
Making deals with devils.
How do I know this isn't just another trick?
It's no trick.
I will give you the colt
And the bullet.
But you got to help Dean.
You got to bring him back.
Why, John, you're a sentimentalist.
If only your boys
Knew how much their daddy loved them.
It's a good trade.
You care hell of a lot more about this gun than you do Dean.
Don't be so sure.
He killed some people very special to me.
But, still, you're right.
He isn't much of a threat.
And neither is your other son,
Of course.
You know the truth,
Right?
About Sammy...
And the other children?
Yeah.
I've known for a while.
But Sam doesn't, does he?
You've been playing dumb.
Can you bring Dean back?
Yes or no.
No.
But I know someone who can.
It's not a problem.
Good.
And before I give you the gun,
I'm gonna want to make sure that Dean's okay,
With my own eyes.
Oh, John, I'm offended.
Don't you trust me?
Fine.
So we have a deal?
No, John, not yet.
You still need to sweeten the pot.
With what?
There's something else I want
As much as that gun.
Maybe more.
It's time to put the pain behind you.
And go where?
Sorry.
I can't give away the big punch line.
Moment of truth.
No changing your mind later.
So, what's it going to be?
What are you doing that for?
I'm not doing it.
What the hell...!
You can't do this!
Get away!
What's happening?
!
Today's your lucky day, kid.
Dean!
Help!
I need help!
I can't explain it.
The edema has vanished.
The internal contusions are healed.
Your vitals are good.
You got to have some kind of angel watching over you.
Thanks, doc.
You said a reaper was after me?
Yeah.
How did I ditch it?
You got me.
Dean, you really don't remember anything?
No.
Except this
Pit in my stomach.
Sam, something's wrong.
How you feeling, dude?
Fine, I guess.
I'm alive.
That's what matters.
Where were you last night?
I had some things to take care of.
Well, that's specific.
Come on, Sam.
Did you go after the demon?
No.
You know, why don't I believe you right now?
Can we not fight?
You know, half the time we're fighting, I don't know what we're fighting about.
We're just butting heads.
Look, Sammy, I've...
I've made some mistakes.
But I've always done the best I could.
I just don't want to fight anymore, okay?
Dad, are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.
Hey, son, would you mind, uh...
Would you mind getting me a cup of caffeine?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
What is it?
You know, when, uh...
When you were a kid,
I'd come home from a hunt,
And after what I'd seen, I'd be...
I'd be wrecked.
And you...
You'd come up to me, and
You'd put your hand on my shoulder, and you'd look me in the eye, and you'd...
You'd say, "it's okay, dad".
I'm sorry.
Why?
You shouldn't have had to say that to me.
I should've been saying that to you.
You know, I put...
I put too much on your shoulders.
I made you grow up too fast.
You took care of Sammy.
You took care of me.
You did that.
And you didn't complain.
Not once.
I just want you to know...
That I am so proud of you.
Is it really you talking?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's really me.
Why are you saying this stuff?
I want you to watch out for Sammy, okay?
Yeah, dad, you know I will.
You're scaring me.
Don't be scared, Dean.
Okay.
Dad?
No, no, no, it's our dad.
It's our dad!
Okay.
Let's try again.
An amp of atropine.
Come on...
Okay.
Stop compression.
Come on, come on.
Still no pulse.
Okay.
That's it, everybody.
I'll call it.
Time of death, 10:41 a.M.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.

Flawless victory!

Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1[ miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $5[ sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1[ dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
ThE EnD
greetings from roNy 300MBUNiTED
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
Is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- I trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- I won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- I won't.
- It's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you.
I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not.
I...
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
Is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks.
I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour...
I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- I shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay...
I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- I'm following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- I am Goro!
General of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- I know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up.
I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now...
I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking. "
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal. "
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do.
I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
But it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you...
I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care... of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home...
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
This was a roNy re-encode for 300MBUNiTED.co
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Subtitles:
Modern Videofilm
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Subtitles:
Modern Videofilm
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
Is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- I trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- I won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- I won't.
- It's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you.
I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not.
I...
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
Is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks.
I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour...
I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- I shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay...
I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- I'm following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- I am Goro!
General of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- I know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up.
I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now...
I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking. "
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal. "
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do.
I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
But it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you...
I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care... of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home...
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Subtitles:
Modern Videofilm
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
MORTAL KOMBAT
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Re: sync by Scooby, credit to Modern Videofilm
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
No, please.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
Let's go.
Sixty seconds to target.
- Jaxx, is the perimeter secured?
- Locked tight.
- It better be.
I want Kano.
- Trust me, Sonya.
I trust one person on this planet, Jaxx.
You're talking to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman.
Don't you, Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she's gonna follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Maybe me and Sonya should share a cabin have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano you're going to need a Seeing Eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
And the press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
Cut.
- All right, reset.
We're back in 15.
- I'm not doing it again.
- What do you mean?
- I'm not.
Johnny, it's the last shot.
Where are you going?
To my trailer.
I'm gonna get a gun and I'm gonna shoot myself for being in your movie.
It'll kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me, Johnny.
- I love you, I need you.
- Johnny.
Excuse me, Johnny, there's, uh, someone over there who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.
You let somebody on the set you don't know?
No, of course not, I...
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh, God, no, I...
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Hey, mister, you're in my chair.
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd, I...
I see the, uh, press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
Johnny, you're one of the best martial artists in the world.
And I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The best fighters in the world are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world that you're the real goods.
- So how do I, uh...?
- There's a boat.
It leaves Pier 40, Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
Liu.
- Is this the place?
- Yes.
- This is where we found his body.
- What happened?
After you left for America, he followed in your footsteps preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather, it wasn't enough that you filled my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things, Grandfather.
- How can you, a wise man, believe this?
- We all believe in it.
Including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the chosen one.
No.
He left our temple, turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the tournament.
For what reason?
The man who killed my brother will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going.
- Or you will fail.
- Oh, yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple and ran away, isn't it?
The great tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your god of thunder and lightning.
He's just a beggar.
Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'm going to find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my lord.
- And we've lost so much time.
- I know.
But there is no one else.
- Oh, give me a break.
- Hey.
- Look, don't let them get to you.
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, you're Art Lean, aren't you?
Man, I saw you fight in London, you were great.
Thanks.
I saw a couple of your films.
- Listen, you can't fake those moves.
- Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Hey, pal, when the ship comes in, could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
Yeah.
I pay money, you carry the bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
- I got it.
- Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying his ass off.
Kano could be a thousand miles from here by now.
What is that?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That's him.
- Hold on.
That's it, baby.
Come to papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya.
Hey, you.
All right, tough guy, you wanna get... rough?
No, do you?
Hi.
I'm Johnny Cage, and you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
- But I'm sure I can help you find him.
- Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
It's an honor to finally meet you, Sonya.
Shang Tsung, at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour, I'd love to give it to you myself.
Hey, be nice to the lady.
She's just doing her job.
When I want backup, I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero, deadliest of enemies.
But slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament.
- As your emperor well knows.
- My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- I shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island, where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
We got a guy with things coming out of his hand another guy who freezes stuff.
And then a man who, as far as I can tell, is made out of electricity.
I mean, how did he disappear like that?
What is going on?
Who is this guy?
Let's just think this through.
There is a rational explanation for this.
He's Rayden.
God of lightning and protector of the realm of Earth.
- Oh, great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is vastly more important than your ego your enemy or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the realm of Earth in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful, then why doesn't he just invade us?
To enter the realm of Earth the emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung, and his warriors have to win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the 10th tournament.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are gonna save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat is not about death, but life.
Mortal men and women defending your own world.
Why are you telling us all this?
- What about the others?
- They are all great fighters.
But I have looked into their souls.
And yours.
One of you three will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now, you will lose your life and your soul.
He is gonna pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, why don't you call my agent?
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
That electrical disturbance must have blown out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay.
I give up.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, ha, ha.
Ah, no more steps.
Oh, great.
Can't wait to see what the bathrooms look like.
You know, when a woman looks at you like that it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's a most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some of you will even have the distinct honor and pleasure to face Prince Goro, our reigning champion.
You are all witnesses to one of the greatest turning points in the history of your planet.
Treasure these moments as if they were your last.
And now, for a taste of things to come.
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament", he said.
"Be good for the career", he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Hey, where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Don't you remember what Rayden said?
Yeah, well, he didn't say anything to me.
Shang Tsung knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you gotta admire her.
When she sets her mind on something...
It's not her mind you're admiring.
It's true.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it, it's a guy thing.
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm following him.
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Why don't we forget about Shang Tsung?
What do you mean, "forget about him"?
Did you see what happened back there?
- I wanna get to the bottom of this.
- Are you out of your mind?
Sonya.
You go ahead, find out what that was.
- Liu and I will wait right here.
- What?
See, me, I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man, hand-to-hand.
Just like my daddy taught me.
But what I saw out there was not very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
So then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I wanna know, if this Shang Tsung guy is so great how come he's got such a crummy-looking boat?
Anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments."
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power become his slaves.
Yeah?
Well, I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool.
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the emperor himself.
- You're some kind of royalty too, right?
- I am Goro.
General of the armies of Outworld and prince of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that?
Something like underground?
Yes, something like that.
Yeah?
Well, I'm kind of an underworld boss myself, you know.
Well, I mean, back home.
How lucky for them back home.
It's true, Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity, no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth, men like him can amass great wealth and almost godlike power.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
- Now, when do I get paid?
- After you've fought the girl.
But remember, she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
I've come to warn you that Kung Lao's descendent is competing in the tournament.
You must handle him carefully.
I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to absolute victory which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
- Princess Kitana.
- The emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
But she must not be allowed to join with the forces from the realm of Earth.
Especially Liu Kang.
- What's so special about you?
- I don't know.
The emperor will not tolerate failure.
And neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look.
That has to be Princess Kitana.
- I think she's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- She's trying to lead us out.
- Forget about her, she's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu.
Liu?
Liu.
- Liu, what happened?
- There's something here.
- I think it's following Princess Kitana.
- Where is she?
I don't know.
- Do you know where we're going?
- I know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
- We got company.
- I know.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Oh, get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing, they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So why don't you show me what you plan to do about them?
I don't think so.
I think you'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
So now you've seen what you'll be facing in the tournament.
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will Shang Tsung fight in the tournament?
- If he chooses to.
As a former champion, he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung is to face not one, but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on, my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang, you will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Your soul is mine.
No!
Fatality.
Sonya Blade.
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now, look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, now, doesn't it?
What?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
No, it put a big smile on your partner though.
Ear to ear.
Give it up, baby.
- I've studied all your moves.
- Yeah?
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Yes.
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't.
- Oh, give me a break.
- Okay.
Get over here.
Come here.
Welcome.
Get down here.
Begin.
If you won't fight with all of your heart, there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win or lose?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
- What?
- Kitana.
Remember my words.
Kitana, that's enough.
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
Is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
- Yeah, that's it, in and out.
- Come on.
Yeah!
Goro!
- Come on, Art.
You can do it.
Come on.
- Make your move, Art.
Use your feet.
That's right, use the kick.
Come on, Art.
Get up.
Yeah!
Kill him, smash him!
Get out.
Get out.
Yeah!
Goro!
Finish him.
Time to die.
Finish him.
No!
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine.
No!
We can't win now.
How could we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you your own fear.
So who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight bravely enough but foolishly, carelessly and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
- What about me?
- Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled it once when you went to America.
It has brought you guilt for the death of your brother.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
No.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
- I tried.
- Despair is the most dangerous fear of all.
I know this, and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul and use the fear he sees there against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
Well, if I don't, then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now, I can finish this.
You're making this all sound really simple, and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
Because I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me.
I got a plan.
Oh, I can't believe this.
You are the most egotistical, self-deluded person I have ever met.
Yeah?
Well, you forgot good-looking.
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who's gonna die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends, but make no mistake.
They too will die after Goro destroys you.
So, what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return, I reserve the right to challenge the winner myself or another of my choosing in a place designated by me for the final battle of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
A deal's a deal.
- What have you done?
- I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro, Goro, Goro.
- Get him!
- Goro!
Goro, Goro, Goro.
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
All right.
Let's dance.
Yes.
Hahaha!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
Finish him, finish him, finish him.
Yeah!
Goro!
Finish him, finish him, finish him.
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
No!
No!
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
- Stand and fight.
- We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply changing the place as we agreed.
No!
- Sonya!
- No!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the emperor's castle in the wastelands of Outworld, where I cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden, can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
No.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- There is one last rule.
He neglected to mention it.
She has to accept the challenge or there can be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't wanna go with us?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough, you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So this is Outworld, huh?
Well, I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
Shang Tsung would have taken Sonya there.
Liu, I hate this place.
I do.
I'm telling you, I hate it.
I'm in a hostile environment, I am completely unprepared.
I'm surrounded by people who probably wanna kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school.
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld.
Then his best warriors lost 10 Mortal Kombats and the emperor entered the realm, killed my parents and adopted me to lay claim to the throne.
It was beautiful once before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I possibly stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you, Liu Kang, I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower, you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy, you must face yourself and you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
Sonya.
My sweet Sonya.
There is no one else.
If you don't fight the realm of Earth will forfeit the tournament and its portals will open to our great emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched, really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament and betray our emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose for all time the keys to the realm of Earth.
Very well.
Johnny Cage, I challenge you.
No, you'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that sound?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of a thousand dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang.
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul, but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died and you promised that you would always take care of me?
I remember.
Now it's my turn to take care of you, brother.
Liu, come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
No.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The chosen one.
I am the chosen one.
- You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
- Finish him.
Finish him!
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you still don't have one of your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender.
It's over.
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day, we will be reunited.
But until then, my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home.
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I've got to tell you something, you guys did great.
Bow to me.
What is it?
The emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Your brother's soul is mine.
Liu!
You will be next.
Chan.
"Liu Kang
- Brother Dead.
Return home.
Grandfather"
Let's go.
is the perimeter secured?
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person.
You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time.
I love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.
If you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says I don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut.
Reset.
Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot!
Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then I'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!
I love you. I need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and I can help you prove it.
Prove it?
How?
A tournament.
The tournament.
It's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu.
is this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No.
He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back?
I want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, I forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar?
If you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?
I've had enough of this.
I'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time.
I know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean?
I saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage?
I pay money.
You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.
I got it.
Good.
Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No.
Do you?
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano?
I don't know who you're talking about.
But I can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh?
I'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service.
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.
I'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... I'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When I want back-up I'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies.
It won't happen again, I promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on?
Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second.
If this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer, Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but I have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance?
If you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look.
It has begun.
It has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
is anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do I look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... I give up.
What's going on?
I don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great!
Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him?
I want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead.
Find out what that was.
Liu and I'll wait right here.
What?
See, me...
I believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what I just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah?
I haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro!
general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that.
I'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well...
I mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home".
It's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would I have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power.
I'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do I get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated.
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why I've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should I worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you?
I don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will I.
I do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What?
What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, I don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her.
She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here.
It's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way.
I can smell her perfume.
I don't smell anything.
I smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way I like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing...
they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them?
I don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?
If he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade!
I have something for you, my dear.
I don't want anything from you.
On the contrary.
I have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back?
It put a big smile on your partner, though.
Ear... to ear...
Give it up. I've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right.
Finish him.
No, Sonya.
Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if I win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water.
is it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it!
In and out!
Come on.
You can do it!
Move!
Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art.
Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro!
Goro!
Yes!
Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help.
If you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death.
I am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?
I tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear.
I know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you.
If I don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time.
If I challenge him now... I can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause I can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. I've a plan.
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person I have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die?
I'm not the one who'll die.
I see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, I shall grant it.
In return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing.
In a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear.
It's...
How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done?
I made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro!
Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem.
I'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes!
Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes!
Yes!
- Goro!
Goro!
Finish him!
Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop!
I hereby exercise my right to challenge.
I challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...
Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung?
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat.
I have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go?
In Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But I'm fine.
I can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld.
I can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there.
I hate this place.
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.
A hostile environment, I'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass.
It's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne.
but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can I stop this from happening in my world?
If I did not believe in you... I would not have helped you.
In the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear.
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.
I am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else.
If you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched.
Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor?
In his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You'll fight me.
I am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao.
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield?
I accept.
Leave us.
I will take care..
of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy.
is that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang!
I can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear.
I'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan?
It can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me?
I remember.
It's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me.
I forgive you for letting me die.
It wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One.
I am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own.
I pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory.
I knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home..
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable.
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.
I don't think so.
Excellent!
Flawless victory!

...Praise be to God.
Food and clothing, house and home,
Where would God's children be without them?
Man is nourished on God's word children have homes, where their father lives.
Praise be to God.
Receive the Holy Cross, for both your face and your chest, as a witness that you belong to the crucified Lord Jesus Christ.
What's the child's name?
Frederik Steppe Andersen.
Do you believe in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?
Yes.

Yes.
Do you want to be baptized in this faith?
Yes.
(The HumanBeast), The Beast Within
Otto gets promoted today.
Haven't we expected that for the past 10 years?
Now he's first in line.
It must be hard times for the meat industry
Ouch!
That hurts.
Do it right!
It's good for your muscles.
Frederik loves Henriette
You're coming tonight, right?
- It's a HumanBeast night.
- Yep, yep.
I'll come.
So swear by the vengeance of the dead.
Frederik and I need to be alone.
- Well, see you later.
- Bye, bye...
Why don't you listen in my classes?
What?
I'm asking:
Why do you not listen in my classes?
What?
Are you naughty?
Stand up.
It's Krause
Frederik!
Now comes the big nasty Krause to eat you!
I have plenty of time, Mr. Stefan Andersen.
It's now 2 o'clock and I'm free until 8 pm.
Then we can really get to know each other.
Frederik, my boy!
Hi, Priest!
What are you doing up there?
I tried to get closer to God, but then the ladder fell over.
Have you messed up again?
Yes, I know.
I'm a terrible priest.
You are the world's best priest!
You may think so, but I don't.
I mocked God, and now accidents keep happening to me.
Fate knows no justice!
What's Fate?
Fate?
It's lukewarm shit... laying in the toilet until someone takes pity and flushes it.
If you raise the ladder, I'll give you a gift.
Come on!
Good!
- Come!
- It weighs more than my Dad!
Come!
Frederik?
Come here!
You're crazy!
Are you blind?
What the hell are you doing up there?
Nothing.
I was just about to jump when Frederik arrived.
Well, don't mind me.
Sweet Marie.
Marie, dammit.
- We're off.
- Marie!
Marie!
I've told you not to vist that priest.
Why not?
That's how it is.
Fate is lukewarm shit.
Who says?
No one.
He's not timid, huh?
He really is.
I don't want to hear any more about that priest.
Why not?
What did I say?
Yep, Yep.
And stop all the yepping.
- Hi, Krause!
- Hi.
I just stopped by to hand you these.
Thank you!
You could have given them to Frederik.
Well yes, but I was already out driving.
See you the next week!
Yes, but...
I've got a terrible pain in the back, so...
Schoolmaster.
Does that pay well?
No,...
Not really
It's a minimum subsistence.
But I think the old headmaster will retire soon.
Headmaster...
That must be more interesting.
When are we finally going to eat?
Would you zip me up?
It's a big day for your Dad.
Can't we just start?
I'm hungry.
No, we'll wait.
He's just a little late.
There would've been a reception.
Can I go over to Henriette's after dinner to practice spelling?
Since when do you practice spelling with Henriette?
Can't I, Mom?
Here he comes.
Oh, it smells good!
Ouch!
How did it go?
I got twelve cups.
- They're beautiful!
- Yeah.
What about the job?
Well...
Mogensen got it.
You got twelve cups?
And twelve teaspoons.
Exactly!
And Mogensen got the job.
Yes.
Please wash your hands.
aaaahhh...
What about you Frederik, are you afraid of a little blood?
No.
Did you hear what I said, Otto?
Just because you work with animals... you don't need to act like one.
Now shut the fuck up, you...
Or what?
My birthday's in two days!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
So I have decided... you'll visit my workplace... on your birthday.
- And see the cows?
- Yes.
- Yep, yep, yep!
- Come give your old Dad a hug.
He's not going anywhere.
- Can't I go, Mom?
- No, I said.
The men make the decisions in this house.
Right, Frederik?
Did you do your homework, Frederik?
So you won't end up working in a dirty slaughterhouse.
Dad?
Yes?
Have you seen the seahorse?
Dad?
Yeah?
Who makes the decisions in this house?
I do!
Mommy says I can't go over to Henriette's.
Oh.
Does she now?
You all know the rules.
The HumanBeast must find my Dad.
The HumanBeast must find your Dad.
I have between one and seven teeth in my hand.
The one who guesses the number, shall drink from the sacred cauldron... and be reborn as The HumanBeast.
Swear by the vengeance of the dead.
I swear by the vengeance of the dead!
Sacred cauldron.
Here's a seagull.
Twelve ladybugs.
Here's four flies.
Two beetles.
Here's a mouse.
A sparrow.
A seahorse.
I say Seven.
Then I say three.
Five.
Two.
Six.
Four.
Stop.
It's Frederik.
You let Frederik go?
It's done now.
I'm tired of your zoo.
I am.
How do you think it's been.... 10 years with a man who comes home from work.... smelling of dead cow?
How do you think it is... afraid of getting a pelvic infection... because you never wash your hands?
Well?
Do you think your dead animals excite me?
They do, Otto.
They do.
Just the sight of dead animals, it excites me like crazy!
They do!
I'm coming!
Are you sitting there jerking off?
The sacred cauldron has spoken... soon you will be reborn as The HumanBeast.
With your HumanBeast's eyes, you'll be able to see what nobody else can see.
You'll be able to see into another world.
- We salute you.
- We salute you.
I am The HumanBeast.
Don't be afraid, Jesus.
You can talk to me.
I can hear that which nobody else can.
Hey, Jesus.
How come...
Henriette doesn't have a Dad?
Hi, Mogensen.
Hi, Mogensen!
Hi.
This is the balloon hall.
Isn't it great?
- They're beautiful.
- Yes, yes.
- They smell.
- Yeah, they stink.
You could fart and no one would know.
Where will they be buried?
They won't be buried, they're made into sausages.
Stay right here.
Mogensen can see you in the camera up there.
But he can't hear what you say.
Hi, Mogensen!
He's doesn't know shit about technology.
Incompetent idiot!
Look here, Frederik!
This is why it's called the balloon hall.
That's disgusting.
Then close your eyes.
Or look away.
Now I'll take of it's coat.
That's for sausages and the best skin is for...
Frederik!
Alright.
Come here.
Come here, come, come here.
There's nothing so tender as a teacher's back.
But, Mrs. Andersen...
Call me Marie.
As I said at the parent's conference...
Frederik could do a lot better, if he was a bit more... positive towards the teaching.
He's always had so much nonsense in his head.
With such a Mom he must be very stimulated at home.
Now, please turn over.
I think my body has had enough for today.
Now turn over.
You don't get away until I'm finished with you.
Well, sorry, it...
No need to apologize,
I'm used to it.
Men can't always control everything.
Feel better now?
Not really.
It gets better when you get hair under your arms.
- No.
- Let's see.
It's coming in soon.
No.
The girls like it.
And I think you're about to get a beard
Then you just need big biceps like Dad.
Come...
You look like a ape.
Now it is... exactly a quarter past four.
Exactly 10 years since you were born.
Close your eyes.
No, no, don't cheat.
Congratulations.
Alligator!
It's from Miami.
It's called...
"Alice Steppe Andersen"
They live in some of the world's largest marshlands.
- Dad?
- Hmm.
What is it?
Is it true that Henriette doesn't have a Dad?
All children have a Dad.
- But why doesn't she have one?
- She does have.
It's just you don't always know where they live.
He might be in a swamp in Miami.
Heh, yeah.
Congratulations, my boy.
There's nothing wrong with your back, but... but... if it hurts, you must come again..
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
You too.
See you.
Yes, we will.
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.
Hi, Frederik.
- That's a beautiful machine.
- Thank you.
Frederik
Happy Birthday
It's just you, Priest!
I bought a little gift for you.
How is it?
It's very cool.
Come here.
Look into this one.
Yep, yep.
What is it?
Yep, yep.
It's a church measurement tool.
- Not true!
- It's true.
Take a look.
Ok, keep looking!
Does it look crazy?
Look again, keep looking!
Keep looking!
Now look!
Aarrg...
Frederik!
Frede, Frede!
Stop!
Do you have much hair under your arms?
Hair under the arm?
Priests don't have that.
It's God's will.
The girls like it.
My Dad says.
Hair has never really been my strong side.
So that's why you're not married!
I don't think so.
Nowadays, decent girls just don't want a a priest.
Those who do are so boring that I don't want them.
Ole and Henriette, they're married.
Love can be cruel and capricious.
Can't they divorce?
You're just like me, Frederik...
We have the longing in the blood, a large hole in the stomach.
Can't we just pray to God, Priest?
The only thing is that...
God isn't really what he...
used to be.
What is he then?
Well, maybe he's a little red-haired girl...
Perhaps he's a tree, a gas...
I think the whole thing becomes more and more diffuse.
What's "diffuse"?
It's when... things slip through the fingers.
It's only cowards who becomes priests.
Once you become a priest, God puts an eye on each finger.
Can I see?
I'll never be The HumanBeast!
Japanese tourists were at the church this morning.
They wanted to buy it.
They thought I owned it.
Wanted to turn it into a recording studio.
Should I sell the church?
Then I could start over.
In Mexico.
You must not!
I forbid it.
You can ride along in the trunk
No, I won't.
They have guns in Mexico.
I'd rather be with my Dad and Mom.
Well, I'd better run home.
Mom says you'll give her a nervous breakdown.
Yep!
Yep, yep!
Well, better get going.
Well?
What about Otto?
- What about him?
- Did he get the job at the factory?
It's not settled yet.
Well, interesting.
So when will it be decided?
I don't know.
That hasn't been decided either.
He's not career-minded.
Never has been.
Not everybody cares about that.
Otto has other interests.
Stuffing animals.
Otto is quite zoologically gifted.
Zoological perhaps.
If you ask me... the priest has far more personality.
Of course, everyone's free to choose
Yes.
They are.
And he and Frederik get on well.
It's a real pity that you're barren...
You who know children so well.
Hello, my darling.
What kind of a fine crocodile is that?
It isn't a crocodile.
It's an alligator.
If godmother says crocodile, then it's a crocodile.
Speak properly to her.
He ​​does!
I can't help that I was born with a longing in my blood... like the priest.
Well,...
I think your customer has arrived.
He looks like a biker...
Why does he have to come here?
You said that bikers were disgusting.
Had enough coffee?
It does looks like it.
Frederik?
Frederik, is that you?
Frederik?
Frederik?
Hi, HumanBeast
I am The HumanBeast?
I can see... into another world
Show of hands.
Henriette?
Hissing Beast
10 deciliter... equals 100 centiliters... equals 1000 milliliters...
I am The HumanBeast!
I can see into another world!
I am The HumanBeast!
I can see into another world!
The HumanBeast!
What's making that noise?
That's just Frederik from my class.
Frederik?
Why is he yelling like that?
Because he has a new bike.
Mom?
What's it, darling?
Frederik's Mom says you were once in the loony bin.
Now, now.
How's that?
You still married to Ole?
No, we separated two days ago.
Now you're my little HumanBeast.
What are you doing?
Styling your hair.
Would you like your hair shorter, Sir?
No,
I actually want it a little longer.
Henriette.
I've told you not to play in the salon.
Come here!
Customers come here!
It's not a toy store!
Frederik is maladjusted!
Do you understand?
I'm not allowed around you because you're maladjusted.
What's that?
Frederik?
Please go home to your Mom, who apparently has no inhibitions, when it comes to men.
whether teachers or priests, they're all the same to her.
You said yourself that Krause was sexy.
Frederik?
Your Mom is a bitch... and you're probably a bastard.
Can you really see what no one else can see?
Then, HumanBeast, who's my Dad?
I'll marry Henriette when I get hair under my arms.
You can't, Frederik.
Why not?
Because it's me who's married to Henriette.
The HumanBeast can do anything.
And you don't have underarm hair either.
I'm not wrong.
The HumanBeast!
Hi.
Bikers should not come here anymore.
No, Frederik.
Swear by the vengeance of the dead.
Both Hands.
Yep...
It's okay.
In this house... remember it's The HumanBeast who decides.
Why do you have cotton in the keyhole?
Frederik peeks in.
Why aren't you honest, baby sister?
You're still crazy about that priest.
What?
I think he still loves you.
I think so.
Hey, stop!
What are you doing?
Hey, stop.
What?
Dad?
Yes?
Was Mom the priest's girlfriend?
Was she?
Your Mom knew other men, before she met me.
I don't think a priest was among them.
You sure?
Yes!
Absolutely sure?
Yes.
Now get up to Mogensen.
Yep.
Dad?
Yes?
The HumanBeast knows about Mom things you don't know.
We'll talk about it during break.
Now, go.
Hi, Dad!
My Dad says you don't understand technical stuff.
Well, does he?
You know who's the boss here?
My Dad is more important than you.
Your Dad is the lowest paid here.
What the devil?
My Dad's more important than you.
You can't figure out technical stuff.
Shut up.
Look Mogensen, the cows are swinging.
Fuck, man!
Damn it to hell!
Dad!
Dad!
Ages shall come to be,
Ages shall pass away,
Kindred shall follow the path of kin.
A never-to-be-silenced, tone from the heavens, in the joyful soul's pilgrim song.
Merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
Otto Steppe...
From dust you came... to dust you return.
From dust shall you rise again.
Marie.
Sacred cauldron.
My Dad is all too dead.
We can't keep all of them here?
Hey, listen.
I've been thinking that we could make it really nice up here.
Then you can have it as your room.
Frederik.
Wouldn't you prefer this room instead?
Hmm?
Afraid of a bit of blood?
Are you?
Mom!
Mom!
There was a live bird.
It flew out.
Who is it?
Niels.
Hi.
Hi.
Frederik?
You're my best friend.
The others are all fools.
Don't understand a damned thing.
Their heart's in their ass.
Frederik, my boy.
Let's play darts?
Come on, baby.
Was it fun?
No.
Yep.
Yep, yep, yep.
Do you know who'll be your new headmaster?
No.
Who?
I...
I've invited him here for a glass of champagne.
Who is it, Mom?
It's...
It's Krause.
Frank Krause.
You promised that the bikers wouldn't come here anymore.
Stop it, Frederik.
It's only a glass of champagne.
I'm dying!
I'm dying!
I'm dying!
Stop it, Frederik.
Help!
Now get up and eat your food.
I'm dying!
Enough with that dying-shit!
Do you hear?
I'll go crazy!
Thanks, Thanks.
First of all, I want to thank the teachers and parents, and those... who supported my appointment as headmaster.
I will do my utmost to live up to the trust you have shown me.
Are you sad, Frederik?
No.
It's a shame that your Dad is dead.
It's really a shame for you.
My Dad isn't really dead.
What's he then?
He's no more dead than so many others.
That's a lie.
Frederik's Dad is dead.
My Dad isn't really dead, Ole.
He's as dead as that.
I'll smash you.
You think I'm afraid just because your Dad is dead?
What's going on?
Ow, ow!
Hi, Frederik.
Come congratulate your new Headmaster.
Stop it.
Ow!
It doesn't matter.
You must never kick people.
Marie, let him just be.
Stop it right now!
You're a Bitch!
Who says so?
The priest?
Bitch!
Bitch!
You stop it!
No I won't!
I can very, very quickly create a scandal!
Stop it!
You'll fuck Marie, but you won't fuck me!
Keep your mouth shut!
You'll fuck Marie, but you won't fuck me!
I live across from you, you can see me every day!
I'm living there with your daughter!
Your daughter!
Your daughter!
- That's a lie.
- It's true!
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
He's not my Dad.
You're so crazy, Frederik.
I heard it myself.
My Dad is dead, just like yours.
My Dad isn't really dead.
Frederik, you are becoming more and more maladjusted.
Potato Art.
It's really amazing.
You cook a primo potato.
Thank you, Frank.
Stop it.
You'll end up in the loony bin, just like Henriette's Mom.
Frederik.
Look what I've bought for you.
Now you just watch, honey.
Gross!
Get away!
Your hair has biker scabies.
A motorcycle-car model deluxe 2.
What do you say to that?
Isn't it cool?
Lets go for a trip?
Krause is Henriette's Dad.
Stop that nonsense, Darling.
Stop it!
- You nasty boy.
- It's HumanBeast spit.
It will never come off.
I'll take care of this.
What the hell is going on with you?
You can't treat your Mom like that.
Did you hear what I said!
Do you know what you are?
You are just a silly little boy.
The dead will take vengeance on you.
What did you say?
The dead will take vengeance on you, and your disgusting, filthy body.
You don't hit my little boy!
Is that clear?
Yes.
If you ever hit him, I'll never see you again.
I'll leave now.
Frank?
Ali...
If one day you come alive... then you must eat him.
Krause is Henriette's Dad!
Krause is Henriette's Dad!
Krause is Henriette's Dad!
Stop that yelling!
Krause is Henriette's Dad!
Krause is Henriette's Dad!
Who's shouting?
It's not true, is it Mom?
What's not true?
Nothing, Mom.
I will do everything for you and Frederik.
He's become so strange.
He doesn't look me in the eyes anymore.
He stares at me as if I'm a stranger.
I've got a little surprise for you.
Wedding Invitations?
Fucking great, Frank Krause!
Let's just get married right away.
I'm so impressed with your situational awareness.
I am!
Biker thugs!
Biker thugs!
I'll take care of it.
Biker thugs!
Frederik?
You mustn't do that, little boy.
Frederik?
What's the rush?
You haven't seen me, okay?
- Good evening, Mr. Krause.
- Good evening.
What brings you here?
God, or... racing?
Frederik Steppe Andersen, have you seen him?
No.
Hardly anyone comes to church, so I'd have noticed.
I can't get over it.
Who Fate can bring together...
You must never marry them.
Right, Priest?
Your Mother, and that biker thug?
Do you promise?
Yep, yep.
Hi, Marie.
You don't want to?
Yes.
Yes, that's how you should see it.
Then you'll never see Frederik again.
I'll see Frederik just as much as it suits me.
Just relax.
Marie!
When I got home, you'd already given birth to Frederik.
And had married Otto.
You know... he could just as easily be mine.
No.
Yes, you do.
How should I know?
I fucked Otto in the evening...
And made love to you in the day.
I really don't know.
Marie!
I expect it to be the finest church wedding in the city's history.
No more will I be Frederik Steppe Andersen.
Now I'll only be The HumanBeast.
Will you marry Henriette Beast-Hansen?
Yep.
And will you marry Frederik Beast-Andersen?
Yep.
Then swear by the vengeance of the dead.
We swear by the vengeance of the dead.
Now you are married, in all realms, forever.
Amen.
Frederik.
Marie!
Marie!
You can't be serious!
You can't marry that fool!
Marie!
What about Frederik?
Listen,
I think you should go home and care of your own family.
Can't you see you're destroying Frederik?
because you can't restrain yourself.
Slut.
- You're can't call me a slut.
- You're a slut!
A horny slut.
Marie requests we start with hymn number 738.
How lovely it is to journey together for two, who would be joined to each other for their joys increase to be shared by two, and their griefs divided to halve their burdens.
Yes, it is merry, no need to tarry, on wings aloft, that will, us carry upheld in love
Now I ask you,
Frank Krause, do you take Marie Andersen,
who stands by your side, as your wife?
Yes.
Will you love and honor her... in prosperity and adversity... in what fortune God Almighty, will send you... as a husband should live with his wife... until death do you part?
Yes.
Likewise I ask you,
Marie Andersen,
Do you take Frank Krause, who stands by your side, as your husband?
If you're involved in this, I'll kill you.
Frederik!
Don't jump!
Sweet little Frederik!
Frederik!
Listen to what your Mom says!
This is so silly!
Frederik?
Open up!
Open up, Frederik!
Listen to what your Mom says!
Marie.
He shouldn't be allowed to spoil the wedding, right?
I'm no longer Frederik Steppe Andersen!
I am The HumanBeast!
Take it easy, Marie.
I'll help him down.
Go to hell, for fucks sake!
Do as your Dad says, Man!
Frederik!
Do as your Dad says!
I'm no longer Frederik Steppe Andersen!
If you don't come down now, you'll have to repeat two classes!
HumanBeast!
Don't do it!
The HumanBeast sides with the dead!
- I swear he jumps over my dead body!
Frederik!
- Carefull.
- Frederik?
Come, Marie.
Frederik?
Frederik?
Frederik!
Frederik!
Frederik!
Danish Subtitles and First-Draft English Subtitles by Anonymous
As far back as I can remember, I associate this time with words,... simple words now drained of their blood, and their sense scrapped.
Once hard and straight to the point, clear as the sky above the roofs,... like a bike race run across the fields,... words and images as once pertained to my childhood.
Now I know what happiness means to me, that's all.
¤ THE LITTLE BOY ¤
Hey, don't go so fast, I can't keep up...
Will we take the shortcut?
No, it runs better here.
Hey, wait for me.
Come on, move it!
Let's go!
You're again last.
You cheated.
Oh, you should look where you put your feet.
Sorry.
And don't drink anything cold, you're swimming.
Hello, Cécile...
Hello, Dora.
Oh, God!
Clumsy ox.
Leave that alone, you.
There's no more jam?
Down in the cellar.
Have you seen the white tablecloth, Cécile?
The round one that Aunt Augustine gave me last year.
I can't find it anywhere.
No idea.
Oh, I'll work it out.
Who in the world's coming tonight?
Friends of your father.
I broke the carafe.
It's nothing.
Well, then, I guess we don't attend the dinner table tonight?
No.
Oh, I'm stupid, it's still in the trunk,...
I'd stored it while taking down the candelabra.
Don't set my place, Cécile, I'll dine in town.
With what money?
He'll do fine in the café.
In Warsaw, they say "Keep your chickens, I'll use my cock."
Francois, how many times have I told you to go around by the courtyard?
Dora waxed all over the floor this morning.
Come on, scram...
Germain, Germain!
Have you thought about my tree, Germain?
Oh, sure, I've thought.
Then?
But then, so.. .I haven't found the right one.
Ah, good.
Patience, little buddy, I'm reflecting, I'm reflecting on it, that's for sure.
A fir tree, a fir tree would be nice.
Not for this type of landscape.
Flowers, then...that's almost the same.
In that case, I should make flowers.
You know, you like flowers, right?
Back there, too, it's you who grew flowers?
No, not me, in my country I was making phrases.
Phrases?
Yes, I wrote stories.
Funny stories?
Oh, no, mine were rather more serious.
Maybe I could tell some jokes, but you see,...
I don't think I could have written.
I'd like to know how to write funny stories but I can't.
That's something that must come to you all alone, you know.
That is poetry.
Francois, Francois, come quickly.
Give us a break from your Juliette's songs.
Come in, please.
It's very kind of you to receive us.
Very nice.
Christina, Christina!
Christina!
Just a second.
They arrived, the guests, I saw them.
~ What are they like?
~ They talk like Dora.
"It's very kind of you to receive us."
They're all foreigners, anyway.
The dark man, he wasn't there.
Who cares, get some sleep.
The dark man, this is still etched in my memory.
This mysterious figure who arrived on foot at night.
London calling.
He wore a black hat that hid his face.
I felt that he had no face at all,... which added to the mystery of his sudden appearances and disappearances.
And then there was Madame Roussel.
Francois, words ending in UAE and AU,... as you know, always an X in the plural.
X, x, x, and x.
Are you listening to me, Francois?
Yes.
What I am saying?
I should remember better.
Try to think about the envelope next time.
Yes, yes.
Oh, damn, it burst.
Well, you took your own sweet time.
It's not that, my tire went flat.
Mom...
Oh my darling!
What on Earth's the matter?
I can't listen to her.
Are you talking about Madame Roussel?
Did she scolded you?
No.
But then, you see.
I'm afraid she won't teach me more.
If you continue to make mistakes in spelling,... don't you worry, she'll take the chicken.
Antoine, I forbid you to speak like that.
You don't even know what you're saying.
What are you reading there, anyway?
Where did you find that book?
Papa's library.
But anyway, it's not for people your age.
How do you know, have you read it?
Enough.
I hope it's just a matter of taste.
Keep your chickens, I'll use my cock.
~ Where did you get that from?
~ From Warsaw.
I found it in the pine forest.
Will it have time to grow?
Not for this Christmas, but for the next one.
And if you're gone?
If you've already returned to Paris?
I could be already dead, who knows.
~ Hey, hey, I'm kidding.
~ Don't joke with me alike that.
...being rounded up by the Germans.
~ So he says.
~ Why this one in particular?
Because...yeah, yeah.
It's becoming unbearable.
In addition, there's this Madame Roussel.
I haven't seen the report.
How is it that I've never been presented in Paris?
It was under consideration, a complicated process, and I barely knew her.
You were lovers, no doubt?
Oh, Christina, if only you'd get undressed instead.
Don't look at me with those eyes of a greedy cat.
How do you think I look?
It must be for me, I don't have much time.
~ What are you doing here?
~ I forgot to flush.
Come on, back to bed.
That's it.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Sorry, I wasn't able to warn you earlier.
Forgive me.
If you go to the dance tonight, is that what you'll wear?
Huh, huh.
Shall we dance, Miss?
Most beautifully.
This is your first time at Maxim's?
Yes, I'm celebrating my fifteenth birthday.
What's Maxim's?
This is the most beautiful place in Paris after all the beauties were present.
Obviously the country folk here are better.
He wasn't being serious.
When you join with one's spirit, make sure you're ready.
Ex nihilo, nihil.
What's so funny about the spirit?
Hello.
Hello, sir.
Half full, is that possible?
Yes, of course.
You accept petrol coupons?
Yes, thank you.
"NEWS:
On various fronts.
"The Battle of Stalingrad.
"After crossing the Don, the troops of Marshal von Block reach Rostov.
"North of the city a division of the German army launched an assault...
"reaching to the edge of the Volga.
"For several days troops remained isolated from their base,...
"and the vanguard set up their positions on the west bank of the river.
"While that they thus control the traffic of the Volga, the German forces also..."
~ Mom!
~ Yes, dear.
I need to pee.
"They have successfully cut the rail link between Moscow and Stalingrad."
You know there's no toilet in the cinema.
I really need to...
Go to the café.
Ouch!
So what's the word?
Here it is: the Germans crossed the line.
There's no more free zone.
They may be here tomorrow.
Shit --- what about the Halsbergs?
What about the Halsbergs?
They're arriving tonight, right?
Look, let them come, you just get busy hiding them,... because it's not your place the Krauts will search first.
There's Germain, Dora.
We've finished laughing anyway, right?
"You are the vanguard in the fight against misfortune.
Persevere!"
Antoine and Juliet, you're adorable, but small fry's falling asleep.
Let them enjoy themselves a bit longer.
~ Excuse me.
~ To be sure.
~ Hello.
~ Good evening, ma'am.
And you, are you well?
Fine.
Did she muss you?
Oh, she's had a drink too many.
Look, there's a little boy with them.
Yes, it's Halsbergs themselves.
Halsberg --- that's a mouthful, that name.
Hey, it's over here...
That's him, the dark man who always has a hat over his eyes.
So what?
It's him!
He always dresses the same.
We never see his face, he always hides himself.
In any case, we'll end up laughing.
How old's the child?
Oh, 8 or 9 years old, Francois's age.
My poor dear!
~ Come on, hurry up!
~ We'll be late again.
~ Hurry up, Francois!
~ I'm coming.
They're here, they're here, we saw them, we saw them!
That's it, they German have shown up.
~ Oh, my God!
~ Where's Mom?
I don't know.
Mama, mama, it's the war, it's here.
All right, we know, we know.
There's hundreds.
Soldiers with huge guns,... they washed in the fountain.
There's even one that wanted to take my bike.
We saw their tanks.
Not tanks, armored cars.
The guns themselves are 105 mm.
All right, go on.
Perfect, you go play.
You, young man, you stay with me, I want to speak with you.
Come on.
What have I done?
Nothing, have a seat.
Don't look so confused, I won't eat you,...
I just want us to put things straight.
Sure.
Fine.
First, I'd like to know where you heard the name Halsberg.
~ Halsberg?
~ Yes.
I don't know.
You heard that name somewhere, since you've been repeating it to the twins.
In the café, I think.
When we went to the movies, I had to pee and...
And what?
~ Well, when I goed to the bathroom...
~ You went...
When I went to the toilet, there was you and the dark man.
The dark man?
Yes, a big man with a hat.
Ah...
And you overheard our conversation, is that it?
A little.
What else do you know about the Halsbergs?
They came last night.
And who else knows?
You, Bastien, Michel...
Anyone else?
Who else has heard the name Halsberg?
I don't know of anyone else.
Did you talk about this with your classmates?
No.
Francois, listen to me.
I won't scold you.
But it's very important that you tell me the truth.
If you've mentioned this to anyone, you should tell me.
I haven't told anyone except Bastien and Michel.
You're sure?
Yes.
Because it's a matter of life and death, you know?
Yes.
Don't tell anyone that we sometimes get foreign friends,... not even your best friend, not a grown up,... not even your teacher, no one.
Not even Mom?
I mean any person outside the family, of course.
If ever I learn that you haven't been able to hold your tongue...
I will be ruthless.
What would you do, you'd kill me?
Don't be a fool, but beside that, someone could indeed die.
Who are they?
People you don't know, who are courageous, who are our friends.
So the war is for real?
If you move again, you've been warned...
Bang, bang, bang!
But no, it's not like that.
Look.
Bang, bang, bang, bang!
Oh, oh!
So, I'm really dead.
Listen to my heart.
Wait, I'm not sure.
That's not right, you have no right to tickle me, you're cheating.
~ Stop, stop!
~ Francois?
Francois, come along, Mom's waiting.
Now I understand why you always want to pick up eggs with us.
Why?
To meet your lover, of course.
She isn't my lover, we were playing war.
Oh, tell me, you've seen a lot of soldiers who were tickling people.
Francois, what?
Georgi, come and see.
Look at me.
Listen to me well:...
In a country far, far away from here,... there was a queen.
She was the Queen Lisa.
She had a tender heart, but her heart was sad and lonely.
But far away in another country,... a king was awaiting his queen.
He was King Gustav.
He looked around and shouted into the wind.
The queen loved the king and came running... of this union between the king and queen, a beautiful child was born.
Sorry to bother you, do you mind if we go over things?
No, no, no, on the contrary, here we can exchange ideas.
Well, on my signal. do what I said.
Are you ready, Georgi, pay attention.
And voilà.
Wait, wait, not like that, especially not... jerkily, you'll see, it normally slides easily,... like that.
You see?
It's as simple as making a dove appear under a hat.
Francois.
This is what you do at night, you sleep or you wander around?
If you're looking for your room, it's upstairs.
Go on.
When my mother tells me about Warsaw... it's as if I were there.
I was there, unfortunately.
Dora, go on, drink!
You're here.
We were talking about first love and a bakery in Warsaw.
Dora lived in the same neighborhood as my mother.
It's funny, I hope it was spared...the bakery.
These are old memories, I'll tell you more tomorrow when my head's a bit clearer.
You're a little fried, yes.
A little.
This is the story of a young woman who drank,... who sold her soul to the devil because her man has left.
You keep your soul.
Wait, wait, I can walk.
But I don't think so.
Dora, you, too, you should go to bed.
I can't sleep since they got here.
They won't come for you here at our house.
Get up, Bad Influence, the world belongs to those who get up early.
It's already 7:00?
Move, move, move.
I didn't get a wake-up call.
What's wrong, Mom, is she sick?
She got pickled with the Pole, Mom did.
You, you're going to hop into the shower, it'll wake you up.
Get cracking, Juliette, we're always waiting on you.
Francois isn't yet there, though.
What are you doing?
I can't find my history and geography homework.
Wait for me, it's not nice.
That's it, they're gone.
Let them go, if you want.
What are you doing still by the window?
Nothing, I was gazing at the moon.
You'll come back after the jewelry?
Yes.
For you.
After the war.
We won't be Jewish anymore?
There will be stars.
In any case, there is a little boy... who nobody knows exists, and well, I've seen him.
Where did you see him?
~ In the night.
~ In your dreams, yes.
Murielle!
Murielle...
Francois, you know what?
Was it in the jar that you saw the little boy?
No.
Hey, in there, wake up.
What are you doing?
The little one's awake, the others, too.
Mandrake the Magician... the Phantom of Bengal...with his panther.
Francois, Murielle?
Go on home, Murielle, your mother's waiting for you to care for the animals.
~ Now?
~ Yes.
Go the back way, quickly.
You run to the basement, tell them to hide quickly.
You go through the side door.
OK?
That's not right.
Mom said...
You're a girl...
Mom said you've got to hide quickly.
He says the house looks very big.
Tell him that my family is very big, too.
That's always true.
What will they do?
Nothing, they just want to visit the house...
What if they want to settle in here?
They can't move in like that on just anyone.
Anyway, this region's filled with houses.
There's Dr. Lepine's,... the Autezacs'... they're spoiled for choice.
This is the most beautiful.
But, no, there's no heating on the ground floor.
And the others are too far from the city.
But such pessimism!
Say, it's a pity that there's no downstairs bathroom.
It may not be practical for the general.
There are toilets, he can at least wash his feet?
Dora, take that soothing orange blossom tea right this minute, go on.
What are you laughing at?
You're too cute sometimes.
Oh, they left.
You see, it wasn't worth getting yourself in a state!
The fleet was scuttled at Toulon.
The allies have been bombing everything in sight.
It's indeed not worth it putting us into such a state.
You sometimes, I regret that you're not old enough to work in Germany.
Mom!
I beg your pardon.
You can say whatever you want, darling.
Are crying, Antoine?
No, he's not crying.
How are the people in the cellar?
The boy's a girl.
Who do you think they are, the Résistance?
In my opinion, if there's a kid, it must be they're Jews.
Jews?
Isn't that dangerous?
Not a bit.
Dora's just as Jewish.
Dora?
Empires always eventually collapse, you know.
I remind you of the Etruscan empire, the Roman empire.
By trying to spread so far... they weakened their base and caused their own downfall.
Look what's happening... with the Nazi empire.
They are everywhere.
In Russia, to Stalingrad, and in Africa.
And if it were the first empire to endure?
Hey, check out the housewives!
They must have the day off.
Come on.
Chicken.
Prove you're not chicken.
The basket, splash.
You'll give him something if he does?
Soldiers, the British colony, even the toilet.
What do you say?
~ Everything?
~ Everything.
They can't see you.
Can you imagine when you tell about it?
You cover me, right.
Obviously.
Oh, the fuckers.
The Huns saw you, the bastards.
~ You think so?
~ You bet.
War, we can't laugh about it until it's over.
When someone risks his skin.
Suppose they'd shot you, huh, with real bullets.
Go on, get the hell out of here...
Come on, beat it...
Mom?
What is it?
Have you seen a ghost?
Ah, it's you, I can't get rid of this damn cold.
They came to me.
They'll probably requisition part of the house.
This I tell you, that's for sure, by the end of the week.
There's a good chance.
General Stadler selected as your home as his base of operations.
~ Are you kidding?
~ No.
I believe he plans to has move in on Saturday.
Talk about a disaster.
But no, it's an amazing misdirection.
Who could imagine that you sheltered Jews... under the boots of a German general?
This is great.
Isn't this a bit risky?
Yes.
Georgi, I brought you a soldier.
This man lost his leg in the trenches.
If you want, you can keep him to heal him.
Why do you have short hair, like boys do?
Because of, you know, butterflies, I had a head full.
Can I touch your cheek?
This will scare away my clients.
Do you think the farmers will stop coming by... for all the notary work you do for them?
Hardly!
She's not wrong.
Cécile's never wrong?
Even when she was tanning my butt with a hairbrush!
Sir...
I've pampered you much more often than beaten you.
Pampered?
Exactly, pampered.
Go on, eat, Antoine, it'll get cold.
I was with Madame Roussel, I couldn't extricate myself.
Madame Roussel?
It's my fault, I forgot to give her the envelope.
I asked Antoine if he could...
The next time it would be preferable if you, Pierre,... to take an envelope to Madame Roussel.
You can certainly extricate yourself better.
Who said: "To be loved more than we love is one of the crosses of life..."?
Henry Montherland: "Les Jeunes Filles"... in Pierre Costals's letter... to Andrée Ribaud.
I just wanted to ask whether you have a hot water bottle.
No, sir, we don't have a hot water bottle, a caravan, a casserole, or a bauble...
Thank you, enjoy your meal.
Oh, scary, huh?
They gave it to me when we were in Paris.
You have a funny nose, like in a masked ball --- I wouldn't have recognized you.
I had one of Columbine with a wig --- I wore it all the time.
I loved him more than my real face.
It's not always fun to be the same person all the time.
Who would you be?
You.
~ Me?
~ Yes.
Why?
Because you have a bicycle and you're cute.
~ You think I'm cute?
~ Yes.
Completely.
Francois!
I think you're cute, too.
I like it short...this is as sweet as chicks.
Francois, come quickly!
Hide this quickly, otherwise my mother'll go nuts.
If we get back before dark, I'll come see you, OK?
Sure.
~ Are they going to kill it?
~ Yeah.
You're not going to the festivities?
No, I'm on duty.
A very young guard.
Anyway, they won't be there, the Germans.
It's rather symbolic.
Like the little tree I planted the other day for your brother.
There was so much to his tree.
It was a symbol?
A tree, it always is, right?
Where is this tree?
In a rectangle near the orchard.
Well, he has already forgotten it at his age, you get interested and then you move on.
A guardian angel painted your bicycle color of the sky.
I tell you that there'll flow around sunset... the breasts of young fighters.
It rhymes.
You're going to the party, Germain?
Yes, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going...
It's over.
It's over.
They're forced to smash its skull before slaughtering it.
But every time the knife pierces in the flesh, that awakens it.
Georgi!
Georgi...
Come eat dinner, don't wait for your friend any longer.
~ It's not nighttime yet.
~ Come on.
It's the pig's nose, right?
And his nose, taste his nose.
Pigs, they're good enough, but me, I prefer the vine.
The beautiful vineyard's quite noble.
He's right, look at that color.
~ Health.
~ Health.
Are there just 13 at that table?
No, Germain's on the way, they've saved him a place.
¤ Tuesday morning, the Emperor with his wife and little prince... ¤ came to me to shake my hand... ¤ Since I wasn't there, the little prince said hi, hi... ¤ In that case, we'll return on Wednesday. ¤
Francois, turn off the lamp, you'll flatten the battery.
There was something on the grass there.
It looks like Germain's bike.
Yes, it's his stuff.
His poems.
Here's a knife.
What's all that?
What are you doing out at this hour?
Hurry back, you'll catch your death.
We will ever see Germain again?
Was it the Germans who did this to his bicycle?
She entrusted her necklace to Maxime.
M-A-X...
I know, my brother's already told me about eating there.
But, no, we don't entrust her necklace to a restaurant.
Maxime is a name, a male name.
Think about it, Pierre.
Me, Francois, Pierre is the name of my Dad.
No matter.
Names don't matter?
Yes and no.
There are hundreds named Pierre.
Yes but Roquier Pierre, there's only one of them.
~ Unfortunately...
~ Why unfortunately?
I said that for a laugh.
It doesn't matter.
A teacher finally said something... by repeating over and over the same thing to boys whose heads were elsewhere.
I was saying, Maxime,...
M-A-X-I-M-E... is not a restaurant, but a lover...
I mean, a name.
~ Hello.
~ Hello.
Damnit.
Hi, there.
It's nice out, it's all white.
Here, for you: the scent of Paris.
Thank you.
It smells nice, huh.
I'll do it, it'll give me less pain than it will you..
No, I'll have too much fun spit shining!
Oh, I've had enough, I never get a dry towel.
Tell me, Antoine, have you started nicking my perfume to baste your girlfriends?
You're crazy, I've never touched it..
The stock in my bottle's visibly down, don't take me for an idiot.
Treat me like a liar, if you dare!
Look around you --- who else?
It's not these boys who go to court Madame Roussel.
In any case you have more interest in delving into my business.
Next time use a pair of scissors, it will be faster to shave.
What a character!
Oh, it's sad we left the angels behind in Paris.
Father Christmas's so handsome, right?
Where were you, Francois, you'll miss your class.
Hurry, your father's waiting in the car.
Put it like that.
Dora or Cécile, there should be some balls there.
Wait, you give her that.
She was already paid last week.
~ This is a letter.
~ OK.
I completely forgot, but it doesn't matter.
Come in, I'll get dressed right away, just give me 2 seconds.
~ My father gave me a letter for you.
~ Oh?
Is there an answer?
No, no answer.
You have the same eyes as your father.
Yes, I know.
I'll be right back.
"I think, Claudine, it would be wise that you plan to go back to Paris.
"This separation costs me as much as you, believe me.
"If since leaving Paris, I have changed the nature of our relationship...
"it was by the force of events and also a kind of respect for my family."
You haven't taken your coat off?
What's wrong with you?
Would we say that you've fallen from the moon?
Go to work.
You were doing card tricks?
~ No, I was playing Patience.
~ Ah.
~ You know some tricks, do you?
~ A few.
Show me, it will distract me.
I'm not very good, OK.
"I just wish that you understood me.
"We understood each other so well in the past."
Gustave, him, he's the best.
Gustave?
From the people in the cellar.
It's a secret.
We can't tell anyone.
They have a daughter, Georgi.
She's the same age as me.
If the Germans knew that, they could kill them.
Already they got Germain, we've never seen him again.
Jews, they hate them.
I promised Dad not to tell anyone.
I won't, I promise.
This is a secret between you and me.
How long have they been there?
Two months, I think.
But they're not in the house, it wouldn't be possible with the general.
In the basement's less risky.
Especially since Dad invented a hiding place for them if the general went down there.
Do you know any Jews, do you?
I had Jewish friends, yes.
Come on, show me your card trick before we get to work.
Ten of spades, 5 of hearts.
Queen of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds...
I think I've already said too much.
If he knew, Dad would kill me.
Francois, I swear on the head of my children, I'll say nothing.
Do you have any children?
On the head of my mother, if you prefer.
Well, I'm giving pledge, with my hair.
Does that suit you?
If I betray you, may I become bald.
Her hair is the best asset for a woman... like a lion's mane.
Georgi.
Shh, she's asleep.
I was afraid she was dead.
What made you think that?
I don't know.
Listen to me, your fears, you can keep them to yourself.
You'll bury them out there in the park.
There's no place for them here, you understand?
Wait, excuse me, excuse me.
You know, these days are a long time for children in a cellar.
Fortunately, there are dreams...
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
~ You couldn't sleep?
~ No, I was too scared.
~ What are you scared of?
~ The silence.
Ah, good.
~ What's that?
An owl?
~ No.
For an owl, the cry of an owl, that's more piercing.
Come on.
Look, there it is, your owl.
~ And that, what's it?
~ A mouse?
A dormouse, once a big favorite of the Romans.
And now, that's barn owls and other owls.
That one, that sounds like a cry of distress.
Listen.
Can you hear the river flowing?
Do you think I can hear the lapping of the water over the pebbles?
Yet there are thousands of other noises.
Frogs jumping, trout leaping out of the water to catch an insect.
Is that a train?
A fox?
No, these are Logarec's dogs.
Nightingales, we can hear them at night, too?
Yes, but nightingales, they do require more light from the sun.
~ Oh.
~ Yeah.
You can see that by putting in some effort, you can hear everything at night... everything we can't see.
This is why sometimes it's important to remain silent.
Get cracking, we'll still going to be late because of you.
Strange how they look just like everybody else, huh?
Looks aren't everything.
You coming with me?
No thanks, I've got my bike.
Georgi?
We're just finishing up the Christmas tree.
Wait for me, I'll just be a quarter of an hour.
The star hit the ceiling, it's so tall, the fir... and then there are balls of all colors... red and gold and silver garlands.
I haven't counted but there are at least a hundred.
When we lived in Paris,... they were hung with Father Christmases hanging from the branches,... and lots of gifts beside the tree.
I'll bring you a Father Christmas.
And then I have a gift as a surprise, you'll see.
What are you doing here?
Just talking with my friend.
Friend?
Yes, he who dwells under the house.
Under the house?
Yes, he's dumb.
He lives with the mouse.
"Often laugh"?
Animal!
Bigger, like Mandrake the Magician or the Ghost of Bengal.
A magician or a ghost?
A ghost, who no one ever sees.
Invisible.
Yes, there is only me who can see him, at night he runs into the woods.
At night, no one can see anything.
Yes, he can see.
He has phosphorescent eyes, as big as headlights.
Come on, you're cold.
~ What time is it?
~ The master isn't here, he's out.
What time will he come back?
At times the master's hours are as fanciful as his clock's.
Chard again?
This is war.
You're still very lucky, your war is pretty relaxed.
If only you had known the Great War, that of '14.
We're not waiting for Dad?
No, he asked us not to wait.
He must have an appointment with the dark man.
Who's that?
Hush?
Dora, don't talk, you're deaf and dumb.
Francois, get back to your place, please!
Stay there.
One moment, Madame.
I need to talk to your husband.
Hello, sir.
Good evening.
What did he say to you?
There was a leak, someone spilled the beans.
Oh, dear.
He advises me to disinfect the basement within 48 hours.
These are his own words.
Someone let it slip.
Good Sunday.
Yes.
It's cold here.
Yes.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Just seeing how far you could see.
Not very.
No, not very much.
I'm not dressed yet... and I'm wearing my father's sweater.
They are less afraid now.
They say your father is our Santa Claus.
They also say that when you sleep in the house of Father Christmas... you should no longer be afraid.
And you, are you scared sometimes?
Sometimes, but not all the time.
We'll have to leave.
I'm sorry, I'll take you to the border.
What are you doing here?
No, Francois, you stay, you'll be helpful.
Well, I brought the car to the door.
I'm sorry to upset you like this.
Georgi, what are you waiting for.
Get dressed, quickly.
It this where you hide your birds?
My birds...they're well hidden, all right.
We can't take any luggage.
My wife will look after your stuff.
We'll keep it in a safe place.
Don't worry.
Let's go.
You couldn't ask for a more comfortable ride, right?
~ Is it a long trip?
~ Roughly three hours.
The little one --- she can't stand being confined like that.
She'll ride with me.
With two children, I will be even better.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Keep your eyes peeled.
And enjoy the countryside, OK?
You'll tell us all about it.
Here, you can keep it, I'm giving it to you.
Thank you.
Could I see Mom, just for a minute?
Come on, let's go.
~ There they are again.
~ Shit.
~ Ouch!
~ Are you crazy, Dad?
She's your sister, you argue.
We're going to see your grandmother.
When you arrive at the checkpoint, you pull her hair.
You start screaming.
Go on, Francois, quickly.
Ouch, stop, ouch!
Stop, stop!
Your papers.
These are your children?
~ Unfortunately, yes.
~ "Unfortunately"?
A three hour trip and they're driving me crazy.
They hit me...
On My nefVeS.
They drive me crazy.
Where are you taking the kids?
To Hell, and they'll stay there.
To Hell.
This is fine, let them pass.
You've really hurt us, Dad.
I had to come up with something, all right?
You also hurt my hair.
Next time, I'm shaving my head.
If you do that, you'll look more like a boy.
Oh, oh.
~ Did you hear that?
~ What?
Hello, hello.
Hello, echo.
It would be nice when I'm in Spain... if I could call out to the echo:...
"Hello Francois, it's me, Georgi.
How are you?"
You reply to the echo: "Hello Georgi, I'm very well, thank you.
"Isn't Spain beautiful?"
It would be like a phone, a magic phone.
Really?
Maybe they invented the telephone from that.
But no, you're stupid.
Children, it's time.
I thought we were going to sleep at the farm.
This is where we separate.
Go back and wait at the farm with the kid.
How much farther is it?
2 to 3 kilometers.
If all goes well, I'll be back in less than an hour.
Good luck, Gustave.
Thank you very much.
~ Goodbye.
~ Goodbye.
Come on.
Don't forget the echo.
Ours are already across.
Do you know who squealed?
No.
We'd hardly say that this is wartime.
No, we wouldn't.
Come, follow me.
The bicycles.
Ah, sir....
Good evening.
Yes, I know.
They are youngsters in a foreign land,... and it's Christmas.
Do not worry, tomorrow we will be gone.
Far away.
But we'll be replaced.
I warn you,... the replacements will be those who are more picky... about the health of this land.
The SS doesn't hand out presents.
Welcome to the front.
The situation is in hand.
Civilians are in your room.
You took your time.
I'll take over.
And assure your mother we're back.
Shit, I'm sure they just shot up the clay kiln.
Francois... my little boy,... my very blond son, my Jesus.
He was born the divine child... the woods resound from the bagpipes,...
He was born the divine child... ~ And Papa?
~ He stayed on the stairs.
I saw naked men in the garden and a lady in a chandelier.
~ Huh?
~ Yes.
It was so nice here,... there was plenty of time for each other... and for the children.
It's so nice to grow along with the trees.
I don't know, but I always dream...
About a large family, like in picture books.
And why not?
Because children grow up... and I want them to learn to think,... so no ideology can hold sway over them.
They need the capital.
It sharpens the mind's muscle.
So why are we here?
To escape the war.
Today, it's everywhere.
It spreads like a nasty oil stain.
The house is now debauched.
But I'll repaint the house, I'll straighten it up.
You can't repair a rape.
That, we hadn't planned for, not quite.
Amazing cover, you said.
Me, did I say that?
We're going back to Paris.
Good idea, maybe I could stay with you?
Isn't this a bit risky?
Really, why?
Georgi, Georgi.
Georgi.
Georgi.
Mom, she won't know how to drive the car.
It would have been better if we all went back together.
They have to close up the house.
And then someone has to stay behind... to pick up whatever you left trailing behind you.
I didn't leave any trail.
Yes, yes, yes.
~ Dad?
~ Yes.
~ The Halsbergs, it was me who told Madame...
~ I know.
It happens to us all to sometimes say too much under the beautiful eyes of a beautiful woman.
Just because they're nice doesn't mean they know how to hold their tongue.
Madame Roussel isn't the informer.
She's a good woman.
Maybe a little flirtatious, but this...
Dad, who betrayed them, then?
I have no idea.
A bastard.
In wartime, they grow like mushrooms.
We'll learn eventually.
I'm not a bastard?
No, just a little boy who experienced his first heartbreak and returned to Paris.
Do you remember Paris?
Not much.
It's beautiful, you'll see.
The most beautiful city in the world.
Georgi, do you think we'll see her again one day?
Yes, she'll come back.
After the war, she'll come back.
When after the war?
That I can't tell you.
Come on, you'll see, at 9 years of age... the joy of living, it shouldn't be that hard to find.
He was right, Father.
At 9 years old, it's not so difficult to find the joy of life.
But I knew I was leaving my childhood behind me.
In Paris, I went to school.
Antoine left to end the war in Germany.
Of the Halsbergs, we never found a trace.
Georgi...
The other day I met a young woman who resembled her amazingly.
[Paul] Do we have any cantaloupe?
[Jamie] It's out of season.
Cantaloupe doesn't go out of season.
It's a year-round fruit.
There's no such thing as a year-round fruit.
Bananas are a year-round fruit.
Then have a banana.
I don't want a banana.
I want a cantaloupe.
It's out of season.
Cantaloupe doesn't go out of season.

Come on, honey.
The bus is coming.
Oh, never mind.
If I made these, would you eat them?
Would you make those?
If you'd eat them.
Yeah.
Sure, whatever.
Oh, God, it's two pages.
Forget it.
I'm not making them.
Ooh, I had my heart set on them, too.
Here we go.
Come on.
All right, very good.
I wonder if ES and BL are still together.
I think so.
I think they are, because they were on the right track.
These are good people.
They took the bus.
They saved their money.
With the money they saved, they bought a nice little house upstate.
Tree-lined street.
Good school district.
Unfortunately, the neighbor's kids are hooligans, and every Sunday, they pelt the house with eggs.
The police have to come, but there's nothing you can do, sadly, because there's no proof.
There's no proof.
Got a pen?
For what?
"Bliss or blunder?
Perfect mate or big mistake?"
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on, it's a quiz.
What kind of quiz?
Can you win a boat?
No.
Then what good comes of this?
All right, fine.
I'll take it for both of us.
No, you can't.
You can't do that.
Why not?
Because then it's skewed.
In or out?
All right, go.
"Question one-
- Do you believe in love at first sight?"
Do you still have the Sunday Times?
Last one right here.
Thanks.
Hey, what are you doing?
My parents' obituary is in here.
Oh, gee, go ahead.
Both of them?
It was an earthquake.
Really?
Beams hit them.
Beams?
It was very fast.
The ground just swallowed up their house.
What?
What, nothing?
Thanks.
"J. Stemple."
Stemple.
Can you believe that girl?
Hi.
What are you doing with my dry cleaning?
Well, you dropped the slip last night as you hijacked my newspaper.
How did you find her?
I went to the dry cleaners.
And they told you where I worked?
Well, I told them I was your house boy, Coco.
He thinks I have a sexy voice.
He's a nice guy, and he's cute.
He is, isn't he?
And he gets that little twinkle in his eye.
I know.
He's so cute.
Tell me something about her.
Jamie?
Well, I could tell you this.
I think she likes you.
No.
You think?
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, because-- Well, you can sense these things, because when you know somebody that long, you can sort of read the signs.
What signs?
Fran told me.
I thought about you too last night.
And then, when you found me here today, it's like it was too good to be true.
And though you seem to be this nice guy...
I can see why you're troubled.
You realize if this doesn't work out,
I'm going to have to blow my brains out.
That's good.
So long as there's no pressure.
Yeah.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
I'll do my best.
Okay, come on.
Next question.
"On a scale from 1 to 10, rate your sex life."
It only goes up to 10?
It doesn't bother you that we haven't had sex in five days?
Hello.
I just don't understand why it doesn't bother you.
It's been almost a week.
It's not a week.
Sunday will be a week.
What's going on with us?
What's going on is that we're married five months, and the sexual part is over.
See, I thought you understood that.
I'm sorry.
That's what happens now.
Well, I'm stumped.
It beats me.
We know how to do this.
What is it-- Let's just go back to basics.
Arousal.
Arousal.
Yes.
Arouse me.
How you doing?
Nice to see you.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
Good.
Hmm.
What-
- What is this?
I thought we could have sex now.
Then we wouldn't have to do it later.
Are you eating?
I'm nibbling your ear.
I like that.
And I'm going down your body.
I love that.
And I am kissing your knees.
What niece?
I don't have a niece.
Your knees.
Oh, my knees.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come on, get with the program here, babe.
All right.
Okay.
I'm, um...
What?
I'm kissing your chest.
I'm enjoying that.
I'm enjoying watching that from here.
Keep watching.
Well, you bet.
I'm kissing down your body.
My tongue is just around your-- [phone beeps]
Hold on a second.
I have another call.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're right.
Let's do it.
Just like that?
Bing, bang, boom?
At this point, I'd settle for the boom.
You don't want the bing and bang?
I did when we started.
And now?
I'm over it.
You're a very complex woman.
You don't want the boom?
Of course I want the boom.
Guys always want the boom.
We only made up the whole bing and the bang just to get the boom.
I thought you liked the bing and the bang.
I love the bing and the bang.
I don't always need it.
Neither do I.
So then what are we arguing--
We're not.
All right.
"Would you say you get along all of the time, some of the time, none of the time?"
All of the time.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I can't.
Lisa, I got to go.
All right.
I will see you when you get here.
Hurry up.
Good-bye.
Okay, I get it.
You're mad.
Okay.
How long are you going to go without talking to me?
A week?
A month?
Eventually, you got to talk to me.
You got to come home and say, "Honey, look how much money we made on your investment."
You want to know the truth?
We would never have had to gone out in the first place if you didn't let our mothers tag team you on our damn call waiting.
So this whole thing is my fault?
Yeah, you're the one who wanted call waiting.
I didn't want call waiting.
I'm perfectly happy with a busy signal.
That's because you don't have that many friends.
I have plenty of friends, but I'm not so worried about getting back to them.
I'm not like you.
Oh, what if someone's trying to get us?
What if they want to get us?
Well, they got us, baby.
You happy now?
Hey, there's my beautiful bride.
Yeah, bite me.
All I want you to do is admit you were wrong.
Listen, I may have been a few minutes too impulsive.
No, that's not it.
I was-
- I--
Listen, it's not impossible that my judgment was impaired by the enthusiasm--
Can you just say you were wrong?
I'm saying this is not the most right I've ever been.
You are pathetic.
I hate that you're being this way.
Well, good, because I hate that you made plans with your sister on the first Saturday I'm not working in five weeks.
I didn't know you weren't working, for the 416th time.
I said to you Thursday--
You said you thought you might not have to.
You never confirmed.
I never confirmed?
What, are you TWA?
Why don't you just say it?
Say what?
That I'm driving you nuts.
Why would I say that?
Because it's true, isn't it?
No, it's not.
You can't say it?
I'm driving you nuts.
You know what?
Yes, you are.
You're driving me nuts.
Okay then.
No, it's not okay, because you don't realize what a nut--
You've become nuts.
You're just nuts.
You're nutty.
Everything is nutty.
You've become quite the nut, my little friend.
And I'll be honest-- Yes, you asked me.
Yes, you're driving me crazy.
Well, why didn't you just say something?
Because it's all right.
Who would you say really runs your household?
Honey?
This is new.
How did Murray do with the mouse today?
There is no mouse.
Oh, there's no mouse?
What's he been chasing all week?
He thinks there's a mouse, so he runs after nothing 90 miles an hour, and slams into the wall with this pathetic, furry thud.
[thud]
Hey, this is really low.
How do you do this?
[thud]
[thud]
Murray, go get the mouse.
He doesn't want to.
Murray, look.
Go get the mouse.
He ain't interested.
Here it comes, here it comes.
Murray, here comes the mouse.
Here comes the mouse.
[thud]
Son of a bitch.
Aw.
Look at you.
Hey, isn't that our bus?
All right, very good.
Okay.
Let me see.
Wait.
What are you doing?
I just want to see if we're winning.
You can't score till the end.
Just give me round numbers.
Are we happy?
We're very happy.
I know we're happy.
It's nice to have it confirmed numerically.
Wouldn't that be horrible?
What?
What if we take this whole test and find out we're miserable?
I'd leave you.
You'd leave me?
In a heartbeat, baby.
That's very sweet.
Sure, but if the magazine says--
Remember I took that nutrition quiz, found that I have no potassium.
Got that big jar of Banana Power.
Did you ever take that Banana Power?
Not once.
Why did you buy it?
Because the magazine said.
There it is.
Oh, no, that's not our bus.
All right, give me another question.
"Does your spouse still find the little things you do endearing?"
[slurps]
[slurps]
[slurps]
[gargles]
** [Paul hums]
[snores]
Hey, what are you, nuts?
We talked about that.
Don't do that.
You're nuts.
You're a big, nutty nut.
Watch me.
Voilà.
[Woman on TV] Oh, darling, we'll never be apart, ever.
* Matty told Hatty *

How long are we going to be doing this?
"Do you enjoy spending time with your spouse's family?"
I'm going to say yes anyway.
Look, you have a husband and I have a husband.
We're women.
We're a family.
And you can talk to me about how you feel.
I want you to.
Paul, you know who I ran into?
Gloria Black.
I just don't want to sit with Betty.
Betty's not coming.
It doesn't matter.
You just can't seat people willy-nilly.
This is not willy-nilly here.
You put Estelle Morris with the depressives.
Why?
Why do you think, Mom?
She's better.
She's not better.
Listen, I wouldn't put Charlie near the bar.
You're asking for trouble.
Oh, let's change Charlie with Anna.
Which one is Anna?
The big one.
The Fosters are coming.
Yes.
Where?
Right here.
[doorbell buzzes]
All right, nobody's changing anything.
[doorbell buzzes] [overlapping chatter]
The Gunderlatts just bit me in the ass.
Pop, I was getting worried about you.
You'll never guess who I saw.
Who?
Regis Philbin.
Where?
Downstairs.
Come on, let's go down.
I'll introduce us.
Dad, the second act's about to start.
We have time.
You know what?
It probably wasn't even him.
What?
I don't know Regis Philbin?
Yes, of course.
You are the foremost Regis Philbin spotter on the planet.
What are you so upset about?
He's not upset.
I'm not upset.
There he is.
Don't point at him.
Where?
Fourth row.
All, right, Pop.
Dad, come on.
Hey, that's him.
All right.
Didn't I tell you?
Honey, that actually is him.
I'm very excited.
Okay, Dad, come on.
Dad-- Here, hey--
Hello, Regis!
Hey, James, how you doing?
Good.
We're just running down--
One thing, all right?
It's totally up to you, but I was talking to this buddy of mine who does these comic book conventions.
And again, totally up to you.
But if we wanted to make a little extra money, just taking your picture with the people, stuff like that-- No.
Totally up to you.
I know.
Easy money.
I know.
I think you should move.
So okay, you'll think about it.
Your mother was in labor for 26 hours?
I had a very big head.
Tell her I appreciated the accommodations back then.
I am out now.
And get over the scampi.
Mrs. Buchman, hold on one second.
I got another call.
Hello, Buchman residence?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Stemple.
Jamie, it's your mom.
No, forget it.
No, she sounds happy.
Of course she sounds happy.
Tell her to call back when she's not.
Mrs. Stemple, can you hold on a minute?
Mrs. Buchman, can I tell you something?
Go ahead, darling.
Last Labor Day, when Jamie's parents had that big barbeque--
No, no, no.
...Jamie's mother spent 20 minutes telling me how wonderful you were.
They had a barbeque and didn't invite us?
What?
I'm sure she meant to invite you.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hold on a second.
Mrs. Stemple?
Uh-huh.
I'm going uptown.
Do you think that she would like a lift?
That's all right.
You don't have to.
So you don't want me to give you a lift?
No, I would love a lift.
Thank you, Mom.
Did you hear that?
She called me "Mom."
You don't have to do that.
Okay.
"Do you share your fantasies with your spouse?"
Put down "Yes, but I don't advise it."
Brinkley, David.
Brinkley, Christie.
You know, if you don't mind,
I'd love for you to rub some of this oil on my back.
I just like this so much.
You know, it's okay to do it hard.
I'm sorry, am I being too gentle?
No, it's just perfect.
I just want you to know that you can't do it too hard, or too soft.
Everything you do is just right.
That's what I think.
Thank you.
You're being like a child.
You play some video game one time, and you have to have it?
It's not a video game.
I keep telling you, it's not a video game.
All right, what is the difference?
It's so-- You can't even compare.
It's like on this, you can do anything you want.
You can ski on the Alps.
You're riding a raft through the Colorado River.
You're in the space shuttle.
You're flying over the Earth.
You can sing on Broadway.
You're on-stage, you're singing.
And everything you do, it's like--
It's like you're doing it.
You're right there.
You're doing it.
Could we do these things together?
Of course.
Yeah.
What did you do?
I gave Christie Brinkley a massage.
She had an itch.
Listen, it's phenomenal.
You really-- You can't believe what this is.
You-
- It's like--
I'm like-- It's Christie Brinkley, right, so I'm looking at Christie Brinkley.
I'm talking to Christie Brinkley.
Christie Brinkley is talking to me.
We're talking.
Christie Brinkley and I were-- You could see her.
I could feel Christie Brinkley.
It's so funny.
They had lotion and this oil, so she asked me to put her-- So I'm putting this lotion, and I'm rubbing oil right on her.
And I'm telling you, you have never felt skin like this.
You're a little, little man.
All right, so how did we do?
What, very happy?
Blissful?
Ecstatic?
What are we looking at?
Carry the one.
Well?
Wait a second.
Wow.
Really?

I think that was the difference with the '60s... is that people didn't care to explain themselves.
If people didn't get it, they weren't invited.
The last chance you had to shock people just by the way you looked... just by the way you were.
You didn't even have to think about it, or work at it at all.
You could just walk down the street, and people go, "Oh, my God. "
That was fun.
Marty just asked, "Hey, do you wanna start a band?" to a total stranger.
I said, "Sure. " Seemed to be the thing to do at the time.
Here music is blaring forth from the open windows... of an apartment on the corner of Haight and Ashbury.
While in the street below, a crowd of hippies celebrates the sunny day.
Traffic stops.
The crowd grows.
Finally, the police roll in with paddy wagons and nightsticks.
We were much too busy being in the middle of the '60s... to wonder, even to this day, why San Francisco?
San Francisco's always been a border town, borderland kind of town... where all the strange people come to do strange things.
Stranger than most things.
Drugs, social experimentation, sexual experimentation... anti-authoritarian, if you will, experimentation.
It was antiestablishment.
It was the first openly antiestablishment musical scene.
There really was no audience, you know, to speak of.
There was no entertainer-entertained thing.
Everybody was entertaining.
Everything there was entertaining.
Every event, everything that happened was entertaining.
The experience was communal in the sense that...
Santana, the Grateful Dead, Big Brother the Holding Company...
We played many gigs together, benefits, strange gatherings... of what they call '"the tribes '" for lack of a better word.
It was very pagan, and a celebration of human events.
It was a celebration of humanity around you... enjoying the people that you were with to the nth degree... enjoying the herbs and vegetables that God gave to us.
I'm out of drugs.
I don't have any on me.
Ask across the room.
- Do you have any drugs?
- Excuse us, you have drugs?
We were just another signal that things are changing.
Basic institutions are crumbling about you... and it's chaos.
The incidents are so bad... so contrary to our standards of human behavior... that I couldn't possibly recite them to you here from this platform in detail.
Three rock 'n'roll bands were in the center of the gymnasium... playing simultaneously all during the dance... and movies were shown on two screens.
These movies were the only lights in the gym proper.
They consisted of color sequences that gave the appearance... of different-colored liquids spreading across the screen... followed by shots of men and women on occasion.
Shots where the men and women's nude torsos twisted and gyrated... in provocative and sensual fashion.
So music was like the pied piper... that led kids off the asphalt and out of the suburbs... and into some other kind of reality.
So we began creating free stores... where the goods were free and the rolls were free.
Free food, crash pads, free medical clinics.
- Are you a musician looking for a band?
- Doing what?
Bass guitar, lead guitar, drums, anything.
- Do they need a singer?
- No.
I don't think anybody needs a singer.
And by some fluke or an accident...
I discovered I had this incredibly loud voice.
I started singing blues because that was always what I liked.
And you know, I got in a bluegrass band.
Played hillbilly music for free beer.
I first saw Janis Joplin when she sat in with Big Brother at the A valon Ballroom.
We played together at the Family Dog and started falling in love... and lived together for 4, 5, 6 months, I guess... at a couple of different locations in the Haight.
The Janis that I knew was not the performer... the public was familiar with.
She was very relaxed, very intelligent, very creative... ambitious, but not overly ambitious, and very into her family... and enjoying the community of the Haight-Ashbury... which was very small and very affectionate at that time.
What do you think young people are looking for today?
Sincerity and a good time.
Are they finding it?
I don't know about you, daddy...
I'm fine.
At least I'm having a good time.
They're looking for people not to lie to them.
Kids today aren't gonna accept what's laid down by the older generation.
They only want you to grow up, get an education, raise children, and die.
There's a whole sense of freedom in San Francisco right now.
And when you have a city that's free and the youth are free... they'll go in every direction they can.
After the first thing called the Human Be-In... it was like, yeah, there is all these people, there is a community.
There is this whole, big community.
We're all those people who are the weird ones.
All of a sudden you discovered all these people who are like you.
And they were all people who were influenced by the beatniks.
The beats were into their authentic expression.
They were into living authentic lives that were based on their real feelings... not their conditioned feelings.
And I think they stood as a kind of beacon to personal integrity, in that way.
So you add psychedelics to that, and you've got the Haight-Ashbury.
The hippies are capable of extremely hard work.
This is the house of a popular local band which plays hard rock music.
They call themselves the Grateful Dead.
They live together comfortably in what could be called affluence.
There are many other similar houses or apartments in Haight-Ashbury... maintained by hippies who work in places... where employers do not mind bizarre dress or long hair.
Their concept of a new style of life unites them.
We would all like to be able to live an uncluttered life... a simple life, a good life, you know, and, like... think about moving the whole human race ahead a step... or a few steps.
Yeah, or half a step.
Most of the people who are hippies now came to it through drugs.
- Yeah, but it's not a dope movement.
- We're not pushing dope.
I think, personally... that the more people turn on, a better world this could be.
This traveling road show with the Grateful Dead and the Pranksters... came swirling through called
Can You Pass the Acid Test?
So I was all for that.
I'm looking to always expand my horizons and peripheries... and saw them off if possible.
Acid became a big part of the thing while it was still legal.
As soon as they saw that people were having fun... they, of course, made it illegal.
Common hallucinogenic experiences were like tribal harvest festivals... and the Sadie Hawkins Day.
Total abandon.
Rejecting everything and looking for something positive and new... a total sexual abandon, drug abandon, dancing abandon.
We had an opportunity to visit highly experimental places... under the influence of highly experimental chemicals... before a highly experimental audience.
It was ideal.
It's an interactive event, the Grateful Dead.
We've become one big entity tied at the heart.
That's what it's about.
We're not the whole event, but we're an important part.
We're what the event sounds like, and we offer a space to ritualize.
So these were, like, mass excuses for letting yourself go... without being the spotlight of anything.
Even the bands...
Grace used to say, the only reason she enjoyed being on stage at these things... was because the stage was the least crowded place at the party.
And you could see up over everybody and see what was going on everywhere.
One time I hitchhiked from Austin to San Francisco with this guy.
His name is Chet Helms.
Later, he got involved in promoting the dances in San Francisco.
I loved the acoustic draping in the Avalon... which gave it a wonderful warm interior... womb-like sound.
I loved the sprung dance floor, which... if you got 300 or 400 people dancing on the floor at one time... the floor would rise to meet you and lift you even higher.
The Avalon and such similar institutions... are the few socializing institutions... which teach people how to live and be with one another.
They were experimenting with being loose at the beginning.
It's like, "Oh, my God, it's safe here.
"And I can eat my chocolate cigarettes without anybody catching me.
'"I can hug a girl, or I can put paint on my face...
'"I can put on Goodwill clothes.
I can act out cavalierism. '"
There was a very nice feeling of open-airness even though it was indoors.
Well, Chet was the mellow guy.
Bill was the bully.
So Chet did it in a nice, homespun way... and Bill was really aggressive... and really wanted to make a home for rock 'n' roll.
He had big plans.
There was a jam session.
Michael Murphey was playing a Hammond organ... and Jerry Garcia was playing guitar.
Paul Kantner was playing guitar.
I waited for Jerry to finish his solo... and then they said, '"Go ahead, '" so I jumped on it... and when I finished, Bill came over and said:
"That's pretty good.
You got a band?"
I said, "Yeah, I got a band. "
"Okay.
I want you to come on over and open up...
"for The Loading Zone and The Who. "
At that time everybody was playing blues.
Jimi Hendrix, Cream, John Mayall.
Just louder, and maybe a little more adventuresome chord... but it was still the blues.
We came out with some blues... but the foundation was Afro-Cuban music.
So all of a sudden, the women could dance.
It wasn't this, "Wanna dance, honey?"
"My name is George.
What's yours?
Charlotte?"
"Out of sight, Charlotte. "
They would walk in, and if 10 people were dancing... they'd join the circle.
Or they'd see one girl standing there... and they would just move.
They may not say anything to each other all night... or they may leave together.
But if they didn't leave together, there was a thank you.
Okay.
It was a fantasy, but it was nice, and it was healthy.
And nobody lost.
And the key to those years for me was that everybody won... and nobody lost.
The musicians had a good time.
The producer had a good time.
The public had a good time.
Taking their social cue... from the idea of endless summer and California culture... all of a sudden, almost overnight... people were growing their hair long... taking lots of drugs... and trying their darnedest to all screw each other freely.
Sexuality became less important... oddly enough.
In the sense that, you didn't have to spend this long courting time... of the boy always figuring out a way to get inside the girl's pants.
There were no pants.
It was the '60s.
Thank you very much.
I'll be doing one of those other things.
A thing dedicated to that little girl over there called Hartley.
Thing called Foxey Lady, look out!
I got woken up at 7:00 in the morning, and I'm really sleepy.
But then I open the door and see somebody that appeals to me.
First of all, I think, "What in the world is she doing here?"
And she says, "Maybe, can I come in?"
And I'm standing there and really digging her.
She's really nice-looking.
It's the honest-to-God truth.
She's about 19 or 20, or beyond the age of so-and-so.
And I say, "Oh," and I probably stand there and then...
Physical desire is very normal, and it happens... and there's nothing wrong with it.
I think that sex is just much groovier when there is love.
There's a lot more happening... but there's nothing wrong with just sex for sex.
I remember Eric Burdon saying about... the difference between the way...
I smashed up a guitar, played a guitar, ate a guitar, or set fire to a guitar... and Jimi Hendrix was that... with Jimi Hendrix it was erotic, and with me it was rage.
If you always go to a movie, and there's a little screen... and then all of a sudden they give you Cinemascope... and that was the music of Jimi Hendrix.
Even on blues changes, his music was very wide.
When I feel like playing with my teeth, I do it 'cause I feel like it.
When I'm on stage, I'm a complete natural... more so than talking to a group of people or something.
Jimi Hendrix... had this kind of role of exorcist.
He put Vietnam into that amplifier.
He's the great instrumental genius of rock 'n' roll.
There wasn't necessarily just one way that the world was gonna be... whether it was spiritual power, emotional power, sexual power, or physical power.
Hendrix, all people who just came in and knocked all those doors down.
His guitar-playing spoke of some deep ecstasy that could be had.
Around '66, it was more of the psychedelic.
People would get more experimental... like Hendrix and the Doors.
I thought it was very dark music when I heard it.
I thought it was kind of mysterious and dark.
I didn't know what to make of it.
I thought the words were really good.
You could tell right away that we got a writer here.
Jim Morrison was a post-Beat writer.
He was absolutely influenced by Kerouac, Ginsberg:
Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac.
We tried to find that freedom in art, poetry, and music... whereas the Beats were all into literature and poetry and jazz.
We tried to combine poetry and music, poetry and rock 'n' roll.
The creation of the Doors, it happened to be in California.
But obviously what was going on was... a psychedelic revolution was happening in all of the major cities... and then into the minor small-town college towns all across America.
It was happening in New York and Chicago and San Francisco... and Seattle and Portland.
I was a perfect age... to get the full effect of psychedelia.
I was, like, 16 years old, watching Jimi Hendrix play... and going to Hyde Park to see The Rolling Stones... and listening to all the American psychedelic bands... the sort of San Franciscans, sort of odd bunch... but also the Velvet Underground and the Doors.
The psychedelic craze was in.
We wanted to go against the grain... as far as the flavor of music at that time.
We turned it back and went more blues... and more roots music-oriented.
So when we played for Bill Graham at Fillmore East... that was one of our requests, to turn the light show way down... if not completely off.
Bob Dylan got us to Woodstock.
We played with Bob for some shows through the United States and Canada.
We followed Bob up to the country... and started getting together in the afternoons... and tried to come up with tunes.
Bob and Richard used to have a typewriter... that sat on the coffee table there in the living room... and the two of them would go by and type little notes to each other... and one would read what the other one wrote... put a couple lines in under that.
A lot of times, by the end of the day... we'd have a couple or three pages out of that.
Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll... those are the things that they're using to sell rock 'n' roll... which seems a damn shame, when you get down to it.
The music is certainly capable of doing that on its own.
The Stones eroticized it.
Made it wild, made it dangerous... made it revolutionary, made it druggy.
The Beatles were taking drugs but nobody knew.
You only knew if you hung out with them.
But the Stones took drugs in public, on stage.
Yeah, my buddy, old Lucifer.
It went like this.
Maybe we are, I don't know.
It was a lark.
Five guitar players.
We're gonna overthrow the country... and they start to treat us like revolutionaries.
Christ, just smoking a little dope, you know.
And then you got half of Scotland Yard working full time on you.
Surely you've got better things to do, boy.
Keith did his homework very carefully.
Jagger did his homework carefully.
He'd seen Tina Turner.
He'd seen Little Richard.
He learned from the best.
Most great artists watch the best person out there... and they emulate that person... and then after a while, it grows into their own particular style.
This little break kind of sexually charged the whole thing, really.
I'm just the same as a stripper.
I go out and do the same thing:
Bumps and grinds to music... and take off lots of my clothes.
There's not really much difference between stripping and being a rock singer.
America was a fairyland, and all the best music came from there... and they had the best cars, and the chicks looked better.
So it was like throwing a load of demons into heaven... and letting them loose.
The television is boring me.
Let's make sure there ain't nobody there.
Okay, just tell us when.
Okay, now.
I've done worse, I've done far more.
The Beatles and the Stones, obviously.
Cream came over with real challenging musical landscapes... and pushing what the Beatles opened up... beyond the three-chord, four-chord kind of songs... making anything possible.
Cream:
Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton.
Great group.
One night, Jerry and I went into the Winterland... and I thought, '"This is the best band in the world. '"
I said, "Is this the best band in the world?" He said, "Tonight, they are. "
Cream, The Who, Jimi Hendrix... but today, you don't have a handful of bands... that are so unique in their own right.
Jamming was very important.
This was the residue of Jimi Hendrix and Cream.
That approach involved much more virtuosity as an instrumentalist.
Less emphasis on song structures... and simple pop structures and things like that... and much more emphasis on prowess as a musician.
Time when Cream came out, and we were in school... and we heard the song Spoonful.
So okay, we could figure that two-note riff:
So we could figure that far, and then Clapton just goes:
For me, I went:
"We'll never get that. "
At the time that I started playing... most guitar players were trying... to follow other white players.
I was much more racial about it.
I wanted to be like a Black guitar player.
Ginger Baker was scary back then, he was so good.
For three pieces, I'd never heard three pieces that were better.
Ginger Baker, Keith Moon.
Keith Moon's another drummer that everybody overlooks.
He was an incredible drummer.
Keith, what's your opinion of your public image?
I think it varies with every record I put out.
I think, sometimes...
Could you get on with it?
Will you keep it together?
No, I think I'm very reliant on my management... and my public relations people.
Everybody's trying to be unique and innovative... but few really achieve that.
Like, the Beatles had a distinct sound.
The Stones had a distinct sound.
When you hear them, you know it's them.
The Grateful Dead, The Who.
When you start smashing your guitar on a stage in Germany... it happened in parts of the States... a policeman would walk on the stage, put a gun to my head, and say:
"Stop, or I'll shoot you. "
And I would kind of look at him and go:
"Hold on a minute.
This is a guitar, not a human being, remember?"
It became hugely important because it was actually perceived to be... a social statement... to attack the country in which we'd grown up.
We say, we love our country, but it's decaying.
It's going.
There's a new world ahead of us.
Rock 'n' roll was the beginning of the brand new world... in terms of a generation... bringing on its own consciousness through music... to other generations.
Looking out at Woodstock... something I expected should and did happen.
That was our national celebration... of multicultural community.
Woodstock was the top of the mountain, the plateau.
We got up there.
We were now able to walk across.
We had actually reached a point in time and place... which could never be erased from the history of the world.
It's really amazing.
It's like some kind of Biblical, epochal... unbelievable scene.
Suddenly the whole world was indeed watching us... and we had a chance to show the world what it would be like... to pull ourselves up by our collective bootstraps... and let them see how it would be if we ran the show.
I remember being up in a helicopter with the state cops.
One cop said to the other, "Those hippies are smoking dope there. "
And the other said, "I ain't gonna do anything about it.
Are you?"
The other one said...
We were just flying in and I suddenly realized:
We could do anything we want.
There's just more of us than them.
There were many messages that we wanted to convey to people... about civil rights, about pacifism.
But there seemed to be no entry to mass media at all... and along came the Beatles and The Rolling Stones... and suddenly we all snapped.
These messages can be put in the form of rock 'n' roll.
We were the rock 'n' rollers who became those radical... or radicalized kids of the '60s.
Woodstock was not sex, drugs, and rock 'n'roll.
It was civil rights.
It was Vietnam War.
It was youth power.
It was the nation coming together.
It started in the '50s as part of the Civil Rights Movement.
In other words... the gains that were made for most Americans... were not made for all Americans.
How are we gonna tell people in Vietnam how to live... if we can't treat our own people right over here?
And what about sending people there who are too young to vote on it?
Why is it somebody could go over and get shot for their country... and can't go and have a beer for their country?
You want a 15-year-old girl sleeping in the field in a tent?
Are you out of your mind?
Never should have happened.
You feel bad about the kids who were killed in Vietnam?
- This has nothing to do...
- It's the same thing.
Nothing to do with it.
There's no comparison.
People got more excited about the kids in Monticello than they do about...
It never should've happened.
Unlike a lot of protest, antiwar songs... of that whole entire decade...
Fixin' To Die Rag was embraced... by military personnel in Vietnam, much to my surprise.
You see how they function on their own.
Without cops, without guns, without clubs, without hassles.
Everybody pools together and everybody helps each other.
It works.
It's been working since we got here.
And it's gonna continue working.
When they go back to the city, this thing is happening.
It proves that it can happen.
Janice Joplin said it best when she was on stage, she said:
"If you have any food left, share it with your brother and your sister.
"And that's the person on your right and the person on your left. "
One of the things that began to happen with the Be-In, with Woodstock... was a kind of verification... that there were substantial numbers of people... interested in new ways of living and a new culture... and sometimes getting them all together in a big group... where you can see each other, is the best way to support them.
Jamming is playing hooky.
It's really that simple.
When I was in the Mission High School, I played a lot of hooky.
We didn't know what the hell a bridge was or a chorus was or a verse was.
We couldn't care less.
We just wanted to play what we heard.
If you stay in your heart, you will always be inspired... and if you're inspired, you will always be enthusiastic.
There is nothing more contagious on this planet than enthusiasm.
The songs become incidental.
What people receive is your joy.
If you wanna grab somebody from their lapels... and you wanna make them, like, "listen to me," you go...
You're hitting two notes at the same time instead of...
Sounds tame, but if you go...
You have to have real deep convictions before you hit that note.
Most of the time, people go, "Damn!"
Because whether it's Ry Cooder or whoever... they hit one note... every hair on your body's going to stand up.
And you feel like you just made love or you just touched God's feet... or both at the same time, you know.
That's when music is really good.
That's what I learned from Coltrane, Bob Marley, and Jimi Hendrix... is that music is a complete ocean.
Music is the whole thing, man.
It's an expression of the younger generation.
We have the power, we have the tolerance... we can go in front of the television camera... we can go on the air and we can say with definition... that Hitler was wrong, that people who hate Negroes are wrong.
We can get up there and shout it to the world.
When rock 'n' roll came along, it gave power to the kids on the street.
It gave them something to do.
It gave them a feeling that there was something that was theirs... that was not a part of their parents' world, and it was beloved because of that.
I was hanging out with Stephen.
They had thrown me out of the Byrds.
I was singing harmony with him because he had great songs.
We dragged Nash off someplace and sang with him.
It was an astounding thing, what he did.
How do he do that?
We knew what we wanted to do then.
You got to understand.
Here's three guys that had been and had bad relationships in bands.
David was thrown out of the Byrds.
The Buffalo Springfield had broken up.
The Hollies were less than desired by me.
We didn't want to be in a band again, ever.
And we realized that we would have to be in a band... because we wanted this sound.
We wanted to do it.
That's all we wanted to do.
How was the festival in general?
Would you consider it a success?
It was incredible.
It was probably the strangest thing that's ever happened in the world.
I still have my mud.
About two nights ago, that place up there was the second biggest city in New York.
People would begin to follow the festivals not so much for the tunes... but to get together and create these instant cities... to do this life support, to figure out the food, the garbage... the whole deal, and to live this... positive, creative anarchy... that I think eventually began to terrify the powers that be.
Well, all I can say, I dug it.
It was a good festival.
I've been to four festivals now... and it's about the second best one I've been to.
My favorite was Kickapoo.
It was the worst drug orgy that was ever held in the United States.
This wasn't just camping out... like sportsmen do... or even outdoor enthusiasts.
This was wallowing.
You bathe like this often?
I just...
No this is the first time since I've been here.
Do you feel the festival had some motivation... in the fact that you're bathing nude?
Definitely.
I wouldn't be bathing nude if other people weren't bathing nude, too.
It's in the spirit of the whole festival.
You know, people sharing the water.
We had this incredibly tight harmony sound... and where was room for somebody else here?
He was just so musical and so good... that we thought, maybe cramming four... into a space that's only big enough for three will be explosive.
Neil was something else.
What a piece of work he was.
Neil was sharing a room with a gerbil.
Actually, two bush babies.
He was.
Harriet and Speedy.
In the Caravan Lodge motel in San Francisco.
You'd walk in and these things would ricochet past your face.
They'd go...
- He'd say, "Don't let them out!"
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
- Insane.
Harriet and Speedy, the bush babies.
Of course, Neil is the guy with 300 chickens in his basement... because he'd been given a present of two chickens and couldn't kill them.
Neil has had an incredible career.
The godfather of grunge and all that, whatever they're calling him now.
I was into the rock 'n' roll and the whole hippie concept.
To me, it ended with Woodstock... and a lot of people thought it was just beginning... but my interpretation was you're going to have some jive in it.
It used to be '"Share this, share that. '"
That had its own kind of protection... 'cause it was all done, weird as it sounds, out of love, whatever they was doing.
There was a moment there where there was a vision.
There was a very clear, wonderful vision... but it had to do with everybody acting in good faith.
It had to do with everybody behaving right.
Okay.
Everybody knows there's something funny going on.
Your money in your pocket!
- Want to make more money, you prick?
- Turn it up!
Man, you got your money!
Come on!
Let them in!
You're in the revolution, man.
Let them in!
The question of kids now wanting everything to be free is hard to handle... because it's hard to talk to those kids.
- Even you?
- Even me, what?
Hard to talk?
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Because... to them, I represent, among other things, somebody who has money... and that makes them angry.
The Isle of Wight Festival was the "hate the performer" festival.
It was bigger than Woodstock, and it was international.
It was surrounded by a galvanized fence which went all the way around it.
The audience was rough and unruly... and they booed and hissed and yelled, "You sold out.
'"The music belongs to the people.
'"Let's bring the walls down.
'"We're sitting here in our own shit and you're back there in your Rolls Royce. '"
None of this capitalist shit!
Open the door.
The music isn't revolutionary at all.
It's called big business.
It's a big business trip, that's all.
And if you've come to this country... at our invitation... and we have to charge you, through no choice of our own... $3, right?
If you don't wanna pay it, don't fucking well come!
Listen a minute, will you?
Will you listen a minute?
Now, listen.
A lot of people who get up here and sing...
I know it's fun, you know.
It's fun for me.
I get my feelings off through my music.
But listen, you got your life wrapped up in it... and it's very difficult to come out here and lay something down when people...
I think that you're acting like tourists, man.
Give us some respect.
I believe this is my festival!
- Lf I was allowed to go onstage...
- Listen to me.
...we may have discovered I'm one of the most coherent people around...
Settle down.
"We are stardust We are golden
"We've got to get ourselves Back to the Garden"
It was really a moment, it was like a breath there for a moment.
It was like an open door, it was like, "Look!"
Then, bam, it slammed shut again immediately.
Whereas I was a ham on a small scale and I liked the small clubs... the bigger the stage got, the more isolated you were.
I'd been in the street too long, going anywhere I wanted to by myself... too long to give it up, you know.
So the idea of being protected and sheltered... it was excruciatingly depressing to me, the change.
I had no designs to be a star.
Nobody wants to be in the center of the spotlight.
Not in your life.
Maybe in your work, but not in your life.
You read about yourself in the papers... and people that you're supposed to have slept with... hotels that you're supposed to have burned to the ground... and at first, you feel kind of violated, and then you realize...
"Hell, this character is much more interesting than I am.
"I should run with it. "
This whole success thing... it hasn't yet really compromised... the position that I took a long time ago in Texas, that was... to be true to myself, to be the person... that was on the inside of me, and not play games.
That's what I'm trying to do, mostly... in the whole world, is to not bullshit myself.
Janis was the money magnet, and I know because I spoke to her.
I knew the pressures that she was under to be a salable commodity... and part of that commodity was what killed her... because it had to be this tougher, boozy... two-fisted broad who always went home alone.
And she was a lonely girl.
She had a problem of getting off-stage... and unplugging from the business.
So she began using downers and alcohol... to deal with her loneliness.
She was without the community and without her friends... and with strangers, essentially.
Passing around this Dutch counterpart to Southern Comfort... everybody held the last swallow and simultaneously spat into the fire.
There was this blast of light... and I heard this cackle coming through the smoke flaps... and I think that was Janis saying goodbye.
It's an absolute tragedy.
He was a brilliant poet.
John, Robby, and I loved him like he was our brother.
All four of us were brothers.
We were conquering the universe together.
We were bringing a message of love... and strangeness to the universe.
He's gone, and it's a real tragedy for me... a real sadness.
When people talk to me about Keith Moon, you know, the fans... they have no conception... of how much I hate him for killing himself.
I love him, but I'm so angry with him for wasting his life.
That's why a lot of people died... because a whole lot of us, having been so disappointed... in what life turned out supposedly to be, just turned our backs on it... and went looking at the other agenda... the unapproved agendas.
Some killed people, as in any exploration.
We had nothing to explore but ourselves.
With the mass acceptance comes a tremendous fear of subversion... either from the outside or from the inside... and virtually all rock musicians... came from the outside of society in some fashion.
All of a sudden, you're the big insider.
Anybody can protest... and anybody can write beautiful songs and all that.
If you have a talent or if people are noticing you enough... then you should really try to do as much as you possibly can with it.
Like, what we're going to do now is chop down the words... and try to make it really tight... and what we're saying is not protesting but giving the answers... or some kind of solution... instead of going towards the negative.
Jimi was quite an interesting man... completely different than his public image.
He was supposed to be this wild man, when in fact he was very gentle... very introspective, very bright man.
One of the greatest musicians I'll ever have the pleasure of knowing.
Our last gig together was the Isle of Wight right before he died... which I had a big conversation with him then, too... about the problems he was having in the business then... and I was saying, '"Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.
'"We'll get together.
We'll talk about it.
I'll be in London. '"
And he never showed up.
Jimi was a great guitar player.
I thought he was the best.
I thought he had a really original act, and that's all, man.
I don't know nothing about his business, whether he was a casualty.
I wish he was still here.
Thank you very much and good night.
I'd like to say peace.
Yeah, and happiness.
How well would Hendrix be playing by now?
What would Janis be singing like by now?
We're talking major stuff here.
Genius that got dropped on the floor... and ground into the dirt.
Look at my life.
Look at my generation.
How did that work?
Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Keith Moon... the list is endless.
They're dead people.
My life is full of dead people.
My friends are dead.
My friends!
They might be your fucking icons, they're my fucking friends!
They're dead.
Janis and Jimi didn't have a family, nothing to go home to... a family, a group that could really tell them what's really going on.
Here's what you really look like, not what you think you look like.
If you look at the Dead and The Band... there's two examples.
They're still together and we're not.
'Cause they ended up keeping their own counsel... and they ended up keeping their family together.
In the last three years, I think... the Grateful Dead have been the largest-grossing live act in the world.
Amazing.
It's more fulfilling to be a person than a personality.
Most personalities that I've seen... limousines and suites...
You know, that stuff cannot hug you.
We were right about civil rights.
We were right in that love is better than hate.
We were right in that peace is better than war.
We, it turns out... weren't right about drugs.
Free sexuality was an interesting experiment... that failed.
But when I think about the '60s, I think of the antiwar movement... the Civil Rights Movement, the women's movement.
I call it the "under-the-counter culture"... and the thing is that we're coming out from under the counter.
There's a buzz going on these days called new volunteerism... where people are feeling... they get to the bottom of their second BMW... and they find it wanting.
That was the point of rock 'n' roll... to become a new tribe, to bring America... into a cleaner, purer realm of existence.
You were raising your flag... and you were screaming aloud and together.
We thought there were millions.
There were only hundreds or maybe thousands of us.
But you can't stop a good idea or a feeling... and that's what we had.
For, like, two weeks in the middle of 1967 summer... it was perfect.

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
...pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Yeah... good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji... what's he like?
Is he good-Iooking?
Amasawa Seiji
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I m reading 20 before school starts.
You ve got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated
'Amasawa'...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa'is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill... '... a road winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits for me to come home...
'Country road leading far away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
'Concrete roads, everywhere...
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concrete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No... are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always a fter you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Tsukishima Shizuku'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Oad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-l-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat... are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure... but go lef t to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks... but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concrete roads, everywhere'...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16 th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this a f ternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers'room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Amasawa Koichi...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
'Country road, this old road... 'lf I go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '... to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers'thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong... '
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone... maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium:
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
'Nishi Shiro'... maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, 'Why you, of all people,' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I m the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery lef t this with me.
Thank you... again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the cra ftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-dea f!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dream of living on my own... '... with no fear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '... and pretended I was strong as I could be.
'Country road, this old road... 'lf you go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '... to that town, country road.'
'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye... 'lf my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to... '... push away memories...
'Country road, this old road... '... could go right to my home town...
'I won't go there, I can't go there... '... can't go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I'll be like I always am...
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...
'Fare thee well... '... country road.'
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah... didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi'outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What dif ference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah... you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.
You told me to forget that!
Oid I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird... who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
Lt's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-Iooking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There's lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta'...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a cra ftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is dif ferent.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and ef fort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updra f t.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the a fternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
Yeah.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's OK.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way... is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you a fford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you a fter the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku... that's enough.
But Oad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho... can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks lef t to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh... sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa... you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart '
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course... but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes... it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a cof fee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes... quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Oad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Oid you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
'For now'...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait... you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too... it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get of f?
It's OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No... you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait... it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
...pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Yeah... good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji... what's he like?
Is he good-Iooking?
Amasawa Seiji
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I m reading 20 before school starts.
You ve got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated
'Amasawa'...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa'is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill... '... a road winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits for me to come home...
'Country road leading far away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
'Concrete roads, everywhere...
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concrete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No... are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always a fter you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Tsukishima Shizuku'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Oad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-l-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat... are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!

What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure... but go lef t to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks... but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concrete roads, everywhere'...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16 th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this a f ternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers'room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Amasawa Koichi...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
'Country road, this old road... 'lf I go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '... to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers'thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong... '
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone... maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium:
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
'Nishi Shiro'... maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, 'Why you, of all people,' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I m the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery lef t this with me.
Thank you... again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the cra ftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-dea f!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dream of living on my own... '... with no fear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '... and pretended I was strong as I could be.
'Country road, this old road... 'lf you go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '... to that town, country road.'
'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye... 'lf my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to... '... push away memories...
'Country road, this old road... '... could go right to my home town...
'I won't go there, I can't go there... '... can't go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I'll be like I always am...
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...
'Fare thee well... '... country road.'
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah... didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi'outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What dif ference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah... you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.
You told me to forget that!
Oid I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird... who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
Lt's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-Iooking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There's lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta'...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a cra ftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is dif ferent.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and ef fort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updra f t.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the a fternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
Yeah.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's OK.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way... is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you a fford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you a fter the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku... that's enough.
But Oad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho... can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks lef t to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh... sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa... you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart '
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course... but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes... it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a cof fee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes... quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Oad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Oid you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
'For now'...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait... you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too... it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get of f?
It's OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No... you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait... it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!

You could' ve gone to your aunt' s. too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I' ve got work tomorr ow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I' II eat out.
The library' s busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-car ds better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn' t right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You' r e right!
Let me go f ir st.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can r ead, but don' t stay up too late.
Yeah... good night.
I thought I' d seen that name bef or e...
Here, too...
Amasawa Seiji
He' s taken all these books out bef ore me.
Amasawa Seiji...what' s he like?

Amasawa Seiji
Shizuku!
Get up!
I' m leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I' ve got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That' s funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...wher e you left it.
I' m late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It' s flying so low!
Today' s a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How' s it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What ar e you doing here?
Could I ask a f avor?
Nothing weir d, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can' t you wait till school starts?
I' ve r ead all my books, and the public library' s closed.
I m reading 20 bef ore school starts.
You ve got high-school entrance exams, don' t f orget.
Hurry it up!
Her e it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book car d.
Yes. ma' am.
No one' s ever borrowed this book!
It' s r ar e.
They don' t even have it at the public library.
Donated
'Amasawa' ...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn' t know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What ar e you doing her e?
I' ve been at the f ront gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get mor e fr eckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Har ada.
You take fr eckles much too seriously.
They' r e a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...
OK, out of her e, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it' s not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spr eading up over a hill... '...a r oad winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits f or me to come home...
'Country road leading f ar away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That' s not bad.
- Yes. it is.
It' s trite.
Yeah?
I wr ote another one.
'Concr ete r oads, everywher e...
'Cut down all the tr ees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concr ete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what' s this 'pr oblem'?
You don' t need the lyrics yet...
No...ar e you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying f or entr ance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encour age each other.
Yuko!
You' re in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He' s in another class.
He' s not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don' t like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there' s someone else you like!
You can' t hide it from me!
Conf ess!
It' s Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over her e.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I' m f irst-string, and we' r e thr ough to the r egionals!
Yuko?
You' re in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I r eacted, he might know!
Don' t worry.
He' s too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I' II think about it a while.
I see.
At least your par ents ar en' t always after you to study.
Silence isn' t always gr eat.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I f orgot my book!
I' II go back.
I' II ride you.
No.
You' II be late f or cram school.
I' II call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Her e, 'Tsukishima Shizuku' .
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I' d f orget about 'Concr ete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I' d f orget about "Concr ete Road"... '
Get lost!
I' m home.
Shiho?
You' r e back alr eady?
I' m beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where' s Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Oad' s at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I' m going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The br eakf ast things ar e still out!
I' m getting to it!
Mom' s busy!
We' ve got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I' II take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Ar e you studying?
Don' t think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don' t bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That' s your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I' m washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where' s Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuf f away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You' r e going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you' II clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don' t f orget to turn the bedding and f ix dinner.
I' m going!
Shizuku!
Mail these. will you?
What?
M-A-l-L!
You don' t have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyf riend?
Idiot!
Hey cat...ar e you alone?
Where are you going?
What' s out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library' s that way!
And it f elt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How f ar up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Wher e ar e you going?
Do you live around her e?
I never knew ther e was a place like this way up her e...
That' s not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you' r e teasing me, too.
I never guessed ther e was a stor e like this up here either...
Cool!
Ar e you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That' s all right.
Look ar ound all you want.
The Bar on gets bor ed.
Is this doll 'the Bar on'?
Yep.
Bar on Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I' m f ine now.
That' s a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It' s beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarf s!
So you' r e a young lady who knows about dwarf s, are you?
Watch the f ace...if it works.
A f airy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That' s right.
Are they in love?
But they live in diff er ent worlds.
He' s king of the dwarf s.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back fr om a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits f or her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That' s why they both look so sad...
This clock' s f ast, isn' t it...
Only about f ive minutes. though.
Oh. no!
I' ve got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sur e...but go lef t to get to the library!
I' m right above it!
What a f ind!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn' t this yours?
Forgetful, ar en' t you.
Thanks...but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concr ete r oads, everywher e' ...
It' s not mine!
Hey!
Oh, her e you ar e...
What' s wrong with you?
It' s har d to explain.
I f elt like I' d f ound a treasur e hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting mor e books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I' II buy something.
You will?
Thanks. then.
June 16 th...
Wow!
Amasawa' s r ead this one, too!
What' s he like?
No!
He' s not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I' m late!
Pass my umbr ella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you' r e studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study har d!
Don' t you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We' II be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I' m going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that' s best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time' s up.
Gather the papers.
See you this af ternoon.
Let' s go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn' t that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you' re not just a baseball goof...
Yuko' s good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don' t know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There' s this stamp in it.
Oh...
That' s Dr Amasawa.
I' ve r ead it.
It' s a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a f ew years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you r emember that Dr Amasawa' s given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi' .
Amasawa Koichi...
His youngest son' s in your year, Tsukishima.
You don' t know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, wher e ar e you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What' s with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Wher e ar e you going?
He' s a jerk!
He won' t make me avoid him!
I' ve been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come f or Shizuku at last!
It isn' t true!
You met a prince fr om one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to f ind out what he' s like!
Come on, Yuko, you hear d his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too f ast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it' s like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don' t...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you r eally tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You f inished?
!
- Let' s see!
O Shizuku!
O gr eat poet!
We will not transgr ess again!
All right, then.
I' m not sur e...
I don' t know about old home towns, so I wr ote about what I f eel.
This is gr eat!
'Country r oad. this old r oad... 'lf I go right to the end...
'Got a f eeling it' II take me... '...to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It' s not har d to sing?
We' II manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pr etended I was strong... '
Ladies, the bell.
The sun' s come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir r oom!
We' II show them your lyrics.
No.
I' m going to the library.
There' s another test tomorr ow...
I' II study ther e.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you f or a minute?
It' s closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Bar on' s gone... maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
'Nishi Shiro'...maybe that jerk' s name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko' s on the phone!
You' II go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can' t hear you.
I' II be ther e in a minute.
'Bye.
- Wher e ar e you going?
- Not f ar.
What' s wrong?
Shizuku!
What' s the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn' t know how you f eel about him...
I' II apologize to him.
But I can' t go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I' m going to Yuko' s.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, 'Why you, of all people,' didn' t she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn' t want to hear something like that f rom you!
Don' t you under stand?
!
No, I don' t!
Tell me!
You r eally ar e dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don' t need this!
You don' t?
How do you think Yuko f eels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don' t make jokes at a time like this!
It' s not a joke!
I' ve liked you f or a long time!
Not me!
You can' t!
You don' t like me?
Or do you have a boyf riend?
I don' t have a boyfriend...
But...
I' m sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we' ve always been f riends...
I like you. but not...
I' m sorry.
I can' t say what I mean.
Just friends?
For ever?
I see...
I m the one who' s dense!
The par cel delivery lef t this with me.
Thank you...again!
You don' t have to do this!
We couldn' t eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you' re home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Ar e you hungry?
You' r e not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don' t even excite me like they used to.
There' s always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren' t that easy!
'
I' m not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you' r e not coming in?
Is that his name?
He' s like a full moon.
That' s why I call him that.
Isn' t he yours?
He won' t stay in one house.
I hear d him called 'Ball' at one place.
I' m sur e ther e' s others.
So he does the r ounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That' s how I came her e.
I f ollowed him.
And he br ought me to a neat stor e, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn' t very nice.
Just like me.
You' r e not like Moon at all!
He' s half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your gr andf ather sick?
The store' s been closed and I thought...
He' s f ine.
It' s a weir d stor e.
He doesn' t open very often.
I' m glad he' s all right.
I can' t see Bar on thr ough the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It' s like we' r e in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is gr eat.
This is the time it looks best.
In her e.
Perf ect timing.
Sit there.
The clock' s gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa' s delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was her e being f ixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took thr ee years.
He f inished it the day you f orgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn' t yours.
Look into the cat' s eyes.
Quick. bef or e the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel' s room' .
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It' s beautiful.
The Bar on won' t go.
He' s a tr easure.
A treasur e?
It means something to him.
He won' t say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I' II be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It' s weir d.
I f eel as if I' ve known you f or years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ar e you making a violin?
Uh. yeah.
Can I see?
It f its like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn' t changed in 300 years.
The sound comes fr om the craftsman' s skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There' s a violin-making class her e.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It' s like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight f ace?
Why?
It' s what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I' ve got a long way to go.
You can play, can' t you?
A little.
Play f or me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I' m tone-deaf!
Perf ect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dr eam of living on my own... '...with no f ear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '...and pr etended I was strong as I could be.
'Country r oad. this old r oad... 'lf you go right to the end...
'Got a f eeling it' II take me... '...to that town, country road.'
'It doesn' t matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye... 'lf my f eet are moving f aster that' s because I only want to... '... push away memories...
'Country r oad. this old r oad... '...could go right to my home town...
'I won' t go ther e, I can' t go ther e... '...can' t go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I' II be like I always am...
'Want to go back ther e, can' t go back there...
'Far e thee well... '... country road.'
That was fun!
I' m Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you' d come back again.
These ar e my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You' re the lucky one who was ther e when he f ixed the clock...
Seiji has some pr etty friends.
'Seiji'?
Ar e you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah...didn' t I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi' outside.
That' s Grandpa' s name.
I' m Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky' s f allen in!
What dif f er ence does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You' ve been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They' re nice people.
Come back.
They' II like that.
Just to listen.
Singing' s too har d.
But you' r e a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There' s lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah... you' r e good at that.
Ther e' s a school f or it in Cr emona, Italy.
I want to go ther e.
And not go to high school?
My par ents ar e dead against it.
Grandpa' s my only ally.
It must be gr eat to know what you want to do.
I' ve got no idea at all.
I just go fr om one day to the next.
I don' t know if I can go or not.
I f ight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won' t know if I have the talent until I try.
I' II see you home.
No, it' s not f ar.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You' ve got a talent f or poetry.
What you sang back ther e was fine, but I liked 'Concr ete Roads', too.
You told me to f orget that!
Oid I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks f or everything.
Good night.
Don' t f all asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your f utur e?
What?
Your futur e!
Isn' t yours Suginomiya High?
I don' t mean that!
I' m at university f inding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom' s class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run f aster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1.Spar e Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better f ast!
I hear you wer e out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bir d... who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I' II tell my f riend the answer' s no.
Sorry.
I' m sorry, too.
That' s OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This f ormula will be on the mid-term, so r emember it!
That' s all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she' s her e.
Tsukishima!
You' ve got a visitor!
A male!
Ther e she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima' s got a boyfriend!
No, I don' t!
What is it?
I' m going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Wher e ar e we going?
- The r oof!
Wow!
We can' t talk with all those people ar ound.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you f irst.
Let them think what they want.
My dad f inally gave in.
On one condition.
What' s that?
I appr entice in a workshop ther e f or two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it' s very strict.
He' II see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they' r e leaving an escape r oute but it' s a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad' s talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Gr eat!
Your dream' s coming true.
Well, I' II do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain' s stopping.
Yeah...
Look over ther e.
Ther e might be a rainbow...
What' s Cr emona like?
I hope it' s nice.
It' s an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It' s great.
You' r e on your way.
I f eel like a f ool.
I was hoping we' d go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the libr ary car ds a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you ther e.
I r ead all kinds of books so my name would be on the car ds bef or e yours.
I...
I' II sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don' t push!
Hey!
Look out, she' s mad!
Run!
- Her e.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished alr eady?
I' m meeting Yuko.
If you' r e by the station, get some milk.
You' r e the one who drinks it all!
She' s slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- lt' s OK.
My head' s in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I' II make some tea.
Dad and I ar en' t speaking.
Boys ar e so lucky!
When he comes back to gr aduate, he goes again f or ten years!
That' s like f or ever!
But it' s like f ate br ought you together!
Cool!
It' s too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one' s going f orwar d while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class f or a year.
She said he was har d to get to know, but good-Iooking and smart.
Don' t tell me that, will you!
I just f eel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn' t he?
He told you!
Now I' m not so sur e...
I don' t get it.
I' d write every day...
we' d encour age each other...
You can' t say 'go f or it' to someone mor e ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don' t understand what you want.
Can' t you be in love without your f utur e planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads' .
You can expr ess yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There' s lots as good as me' .
That' s what he said.
He' s going to f ind out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I' II write a story!
There' s one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it' s exam time...
I don' t car e.
Thanks, Yuko.
I f eel empower ed.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go f or it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It' s so easy!
I just have to do something. too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta' s gone again!
Muta!
'Muta' ...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasur e of yours...
You didn' t have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the f irst person to r ead your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don' t know if I can write it or not...
It' s the same f or a craftsman.
Don' t expect perf ection at f irst.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It' s called 'mica slate' .
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It' s beautif ul!
It' s called 'beryl' .
You f ind it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is dif f er ent.
The r ough stone is inside you.
You have to f ind it and then polish it.
It takes time and ef f ort.
You see the or e that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you' d get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is pur er.
Ther e might even be a better stone deep inside wher e we can' t see.
I' m sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I' m scar ed.
What if ther e isn' t a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you' II be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I' II look f orward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go f orth together in sear ch of the tr easur e of lapis lazuli!
Have no f ear.
Space is def ormed on the night of the new moon.
Far away things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraf t.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We' r e riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It' s so high!
It' s not so high once you' r e there!
When the air curr ents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That' s r ar e!
Shizuku looking at non-f iction...
He' s making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you' d gone!
Grandpa said I might f ind you her e.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don' t worry.
I' II wait her e till you' r e done.
Sorry I can' t walk you home.
That' s OK.
I' m glad you came.
I can' t come to the airport, but I' II wait f or you.
Yeah.
It' s only two months.
I' m sorry I' m always so depr essing.
I' II do my best while you' r e gone.
I' II see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betr othed, wer e born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sor cer ers.
It was a poor doll-maker' s appr entice who f ashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What' s going on?
Tsukishima!
I' m sorry.
I wasn' t listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You wer e up until 4 again?
!
It' s OK.
I' m not sleepy at all.
But you' r e spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I' ve got to organize what I want to write.
I' m not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku' s her e, isn' t she?
She' s not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way...is anyone in the guidance off ice?
Please.
I' m back!
Hello.
You' r e home early, Shiho.
I' m beat!
Want some coff ee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I' m thinking of moving out.
I' ve f ound a place.
But can you aff or d it?
I' ve saved from my job.
I f ound another one at a cram school.
I' II get by.
I guess I' ve made you help me out too much around her e.
I' II talk to your f ather.
You will?
Great!
Money' s tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I' II help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master' s thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own r oom.
She' s acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She' s gone down a hundr ed places!
She' s at her desk all the time...
what' s she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I' m not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the f acts!
The school makes its r eport on you after the second term!
You' re a f ine one to talk!
You don' t study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You' r e the one who isn' t doing that!
Don' t you understand?
I' ve got something mor e important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku...that' s enough.
But Oad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out her e and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your unif orm.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so car e about my marks!
You just said you wer en' t going to high school.
You said I wouldn' t get into one!
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk alone f or a bit?
Yes.
Where' s your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I' m back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come her e, Asako?
I' ve been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you' r e doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it' s time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I' ve only got thr ee weeks lef t to do it!
I' m testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don' t say?
Is it something you can' t even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh...sorry.
Whatever you' r e doing at the library, I admire how har d you' r e working.
Let' s let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it' s not easy when you walk your own road.
You' ve only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We' re a f amily.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I' II make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he r eally wants is f or you to study.
I know.
It' s written on his f ace.
I' m moving out next Sunday.
You' II have your own r oom.
You' r e leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa... you' ve f inally come...
but I' ve gr own so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was f ast asleep.
I' m sorry to bother you.
I' ve brought my story.
It' s f inished?
You pr omised you' d be the f irst to r ead it.
It' s a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart'
Can you r ead it now?
I' II wait as long as it takes.
But you' ve worked so har d on it...
shouldn' t I take my time?
You can stop if you don' t like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart' s pounding...
I see.
I' II r ead it right now.
Come sit by the f ire.
It' s cold.
Now we won' t be bother ed.
Can I wait downstairs?
It' s OK.
I' m not cold at all.
Of course...but...
You' re asleep her e?
Shizuku...
I' m f inished.
Thank you.
It' s very good.
It' s not!
Say what you r eally think!
I couldn' t write what I wanted!
The last half doesn' t make sense.
I know that!
Yes...it' s rough. blunt, unf inished just like Seiji' s violin.
You' ve shown me the rough stone you' ve just cut out of the rock.
You' ve worked har d.
You' re wonderful.
There' s no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It' s cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I' ve written it I know.
Wanting isn' t enough.
I have to learn mor e but Seiji' s getting further and further ahead.
I f elt that I had to f or ce myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It' s very good.
When Seiji f inished his f irst violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You f ound the Bar on in a cof f ee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn' t.
The Bar on had a lover, and he wouldn' t separate them.
He was waiting f or her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker' s shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes... quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I' d just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I pr omised her I' d come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn' t keep my promise.
When I was f inally able to go back, I looked all over f or her.
But ther e was no tr ace of her, or the Baron' s lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to lif e.
Oh. yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perf ectly.
I' II give it to you.
Now. finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I' m home.
Hi.
Where' s Oad?
In the bath.
Wher e have you been till this hour?
I' m sorry I worried you.
Today I r eturn to studying f or my entrance exams.
So your trials ar e over?
For now.
Oid you eat?
There' s curry...
I' m f ine!
'For now' ...
Shizuku, the bath' s open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait ther e!
It' s a miracle!
You' r e her e!
We' re not dr eaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait...you' II be cold.
Climb on.
I' II get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out ther e calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too... it' s like I' m still dr eaming!
How was Cr emona?
A lot diff er ent than I thought.
But I' m going to do it.
It' s getting light!
Shall I get of f?
It' s OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That' s not f air!
I' m no man' s bur den!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost ther e!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I' II hold the coat.
- It' s OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secr et place.
It' s almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn' t do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No...you were the reason I did it.
I' m glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I' m going to study har d and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can' t say how soon it' II be, but would you marry me?
I' m going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That' s exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Gr eat!
Wait...it' s cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
...pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my professor will complain.
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Yeah... good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji... what's he like?
Is he good-looking?
Amasawa Seiji
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favour?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
You've got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated
'Amasawa'...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill a road winds up to the town.
An old house with small windows...
An old dog waits for me to come home...
Country road leading far away...
The road to my old home town...
West Virginia, my mother the mountain...
My good old home town.
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
Concrete roads, everywhere...
Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
Western Tokyo...
Tama Mountain...
My home town is concrete roads.
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No... are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Tsukishima Shizuku'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road'...
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-l-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat... are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure... but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks... but how?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
Concrete roads, everywhere
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe That's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice?
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Amasawa Koichi...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
Country road, this old road...
If I go right to the end...
Got a feeling it'll take me to that town, country road.
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong...
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone... maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium:
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
'Nishi Shiro'... maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, 'Why you, of all people,' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
"You" don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I'm the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you... again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engel Zimmer... angel's room.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
Had a dream of living on my own with no fear of being all alone.
Pushed my sadness down inside of me and pretended I was strong as I could be.
Country road, this old road...
If you go right to the end...
Got a feeling it'll take me to that town, country road.
It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
I will never ever let a tear show in my eye...
If my feet are moving faster That's because I only want to push away memories...
Country road, this old road could go right to my home town...
I won't go there, I can't go there can't go down that country road.
Country road, when tomorrow comes...
I'll be like I always am...
Want to go back there, can't go back there...
Fare thee well country road.
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah... didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi' outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah... you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked Concrete Roads, too.
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is cancelled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird... who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There are lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta'...
Whisper of the Heart:
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
Yeah.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's OK.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way... is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku... that's enough.
But Dad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho... can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh... sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa... you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
Whisper of the Heart
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course... but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes... it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes... quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
For now...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait... you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
Shizuku!
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too... it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No... you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait... it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it?
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say no.
Pour me some too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please, I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's too.
No.
Onee-chan wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar code system.
I like the book cards better.
Me too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
- You're right!
- Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my professor will complain.
Note:
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Yeah.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before.
Here too.
Note:
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji.
What's he like?
Is he good-looking?
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse!
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny.
Try by the phone...
Found it!
Just where you left it...
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
Yahoo!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Try your best!
Kosaka-sensei, are you there?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
- Let me in the library!
- What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
Don't forget, you've got high school entrance exams.
- Hurry it up!
- Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Note:
Donated
"Amasawa." Sensei!
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun, I get more freckles!
S-Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Sensei!
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
White clouds spreading up over a hill
A road winds up to the town
An old house with small windows
An old dog waits for me to come home
Country road leading far away
The road to my old hometown
West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain
My good old hometown
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
Concrete roads, everywhere
Cut down all the trees Filled in the valleys
Western Tokyo
Tama Mountain
My hometown is concrete roads
What is this?
!
But what's this problem?
You don't need the lyrics yet.
No.
Are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
- Sugimura!
- That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
But what about the love letter?
I'll think about it awhile.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card.
I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
"I'd forget about Concrete Road."
Get lost!
I'm home.
Onee-chan?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little.
- What about dinner?
- I'm going to wash the rice.
What's this, Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
- Where's Mom?
- Long gone.
Put that stuff away and bring Dad's lunch to him.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper clip off.
- Your boyfriend?
- Idiot!
Hey, cat, are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story.
There he is!
Note:
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here.
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either.
Beautiful doll!
Are you that cat?
- Oh, hello.
- Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll the Baron?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
I'm fine now.
- That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look.
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So, you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
- A princess?
- That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 she is changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad.
This clock's fast, isn't it?
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Goodbye.
Can I come back sometime?
Sure, but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
- Thanks, but how?
- Guess!
The cat.
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
Concrete roads, everywhere...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are.
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
- Getting more books?
- Seven more to go.
- Still at it?
What about lunch?
- I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
- Shizuku!
- Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
- I hate all these tests!
- One every day!
- Did you answer?
- No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Kosaka-sensei.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So, you're not just a baseball goof.
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me.
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr. Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Kimura-sensei, do you remember that Dr. Amasawa's given name?
Dr. Amasawa?
It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.
Amasawa Koichi.
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Umm...
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over.
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...
Right, Shizuku?
Dunno...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't.
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
Oh, Shizuku-sama!
Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old hometowns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
Country road, this old road
If I go right to the end
Got a feeling it'll take me
To that town, country road
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank you!
There too?
!
- Slow down!
- I like this part.
"I left because I was alone and I had nothing.
Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong..."
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow.
- I'll study there.
- Bookworm!
- Later.
- Bye-bye.
Harada.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.
Note:
World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
Nishi Shiro.
Maybe that jerk's name is Nishi too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko-chan's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
- Shizuku!
- What's the matter?
What's with this face?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Huh?
That's bad.
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him.
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
I see.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
I see.
Say hello to her.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada...
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, "Why you, of all people," didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend.
But...
- I'm sorry!
- Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see.
I'm the one who's dense.
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you again.
You don't have to do this.
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home.
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, "Things aren't that easy."
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him being called Ball at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds.
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil...
- Um...
- Would you?
Is your grandfather all right?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer: "angel's room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you.
You look sad today, somehow.
- Had enough?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
- Sure!
- Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
- But one of them is yours?
- Yeah.
- Which one?
- That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please, please, please!
You have to sing too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
Had a dream of living on my own
With no fear of being all alone
Pushed my sadness down inside of me
And pretended I was strong as I could be
Country road, this old road
If you go right to the end
Got a feeling it'll take me
To that town, country road
It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be
I will never ever let a tear show in my eye
If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to
Push away memories
Country road, this old road
Could go right to my hometown
I won't go there, I can't go there
Can't go down that country road
Country road, when tomorrow comes
I'll be like I always am
Want to go back there Can't go back there
Fare thee well
Country road
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock.
Seiji-kun has some pretty friends.
Seiji?
Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah.
Didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says Nishi outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah.
You're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked Concrete Roads too.
You told me to forget that!
- Did I say that?
- Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled, so now she sleeps in!
- Morning!
- Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Note:
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada, I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the midterm, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji-kun?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
- I'm going to Italy.
- What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon then.
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
- The rain's stopping.
- Yeah.
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow.
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school.
What a stupid thing to think.
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
- Hello, Shizuku-chan.
- Hello.
- Welcome back.
- Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books, except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah.
Kinu-chan was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure.
I don't get it.
I'd write every day.
We'd encourage each other.
You can't say "Go for it" to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of Country Roads.
You can express yourself too, unlike me.
"There's lots as good as me."
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time.
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it too.
Sugimura will realize.
Bye.
Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
Muta...
Note: 'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji-kun says the doll is a treasure of yours.
You didn't have to ask.
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not.
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called mica slate.
Look at the seam.
Like that.
It's beautiful!
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.
- Emerald?
The jewel?
- Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins or writing stories is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell.
Seiji-kun!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
Glad I met you before.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
Yeah.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived, and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll maker's apprentice who fashioned us, but Luisa and I were happy
because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until four again?
!
It's OK.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So, you are home.
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm home!
Welcome back.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
- I've found a place.
- But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working, but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Not going to high school?
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle school education?
I can decide my own future!
Don't get too cocky!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.
But Dad, listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho, can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
- Where's your mother?
- At the Tanakas.
- I'm back.
- Hi, Mom.
- Is your dad back?
- Yes.
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
- Dear!
- Oh, sorry.
Just one moment.
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
- Yeah.
We're a family.
- Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku.
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So, smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa, you've finally come, but I've grown so old.
Shizuku-san.
Come in.
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
Note:
Whisper of the Heart
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding.
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course, but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku-san, I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished, just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now...
Now that I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more, but Seiji-kun's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared.
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...
Yes, yes.
He looked so melancholic.
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes, quite the coincidence.
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back, she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you.
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes.
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
Sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So, your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry.
I'm fine!
"For now."
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No way!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait, you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
"Shizuku!"
And then you appeared!
What a team we are!
Me too.
It's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
- Shall I get off?
- It's OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.
No, you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku.
I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait, it's cold.
Shizuku, I love you!

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
Pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You smoke too much.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Seiji Amasawa
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Seiji Amasawa
He's taken all these books out before me.
Seiji Amasawa...what's he like?
Wonder if he's nice.
Seiji Amasawa
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Clumsy!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Keep it up!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
20?
You've got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated Amasawa's Collection
'Amasawa' ...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...alright, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill... '...a road winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits for me to come home...
'Country road leading far away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
'Concrete roads, everywhere...
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concrete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No...are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Shizuku Tsukishima'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat...are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face...if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure...but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Shizuku Tsukishima!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks...but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concrete roads, everywhere' ...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Koichi Amasawa...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Excuse us!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
'Country road, this old road...
'If I go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong...'
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone...maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium;
Shiro Nishi, Prop.
'Shiro Nishi' ...maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, ' Why you, of all people, ' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I'm the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you...again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, okay?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dream of living on my own... '...with no fear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '...and pretended I was strong as I could be.
'Country road, this old road...
'If you go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye...
'If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to... '...push away memories...
'Country road, this old road... '...could go right to my home town...
'I won't go there, I can't go there... '...can't go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I'll be like I always am...
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...
'Fare thee well... '...country road.'
That was fun!
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Seiji Amasawa?
Yeah...didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi' outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Seiji Amasawa...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah...you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird...who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's okay.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's alright.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There's lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta' ...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
Go!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's okay.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
Luisa, my betrothed, and I were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's okay.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way...is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku...that's enough.
But Dad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh...sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa...you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
I promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart'
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's okay.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course...but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes...it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, don't you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes...quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
And I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
'For now' ...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait...you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too...it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's alright.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
Okay!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- I'm fine.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No...you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait...it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!

- Good evening.
- Sure is hot, huh?
I'm back.
Thanks.
Another plastic bag?
It's just a carton of milk.
But they just give it to you.
You don't have to take it.
Oh, I'd like some, please.
And you, Father?
Some wheat tea?
Sure.
I'll have some.
Be right there.
Thanks.
Can I use it?
I'm printing right now.
Maybe we should buy a portable word processor after all.
This smoke stinks.
You should have gone to Kashirazaki, too, Shizuku.
It's okay, I can't keep up with Sis.
Oh yeah, I've gotta go to work tomorrow.
You need a lunch?
Don't worry, I'll eat out.
Our library's finally changing to a bar code system.
So things are really busy.
Then you are changing it.
I liked the card catalogs better.
Yeah, I do too.
Hey, something's wrong with this composition.
What?
Where?
Did you leave out a line, maybe?
Oh, darn!
You're right!
Oh, I have to borrow this again, or the professor will really make a fuss.
Amasawa Seiji
This name...
Shizuku, books are fine, but you should go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night.
I knew it.
I thought I remembered seeing this name...
And here, too.
Amasawa Seiji
This guy's amazing.
He borrowed all of them before I did.
Amasawa Seiji...
What kind of person is he?
I wonder if he's cool or not?
Amasawa Seiji
Shizuku, will you get up?
I'm going out now!
Oh, geez.
You just slept that way?
Get the rice ready!
Have a good day.
What?
!
It's that late?
!
I have to meet Yuuko!
My wallet!
What?
Did you forget it again?
Yeah!
That's strange.
Is it next to the phone?
Here it is!
You're the one who put it there.
Oh, I'm gonna be late!
Remember to lock up!
What a ditz.
Boy, are they flying low! Something great's gonna happen today!
Wow, it's hot.
Yoo-hoo!
How's it goin'?
C'mon, let's do it!
Hey, Shizuku!
Hey!
Go for it!
Miss Kousaka, are you in?
Oh, it's you, Tsukishima.
What's up?
Can I please ask a favor?
What kind?
I hope it's nothing strange.
Can you open the library, please?
The library?
Can't you wait until they open normally?
But I've already read all my books.
And the county library's closed today.
I've decided to read twenty books during vacation.
Twenty books?
But you're supposed to be studying for your exams.
C'mon, hurry it up.
Let's see...
Got it!
Hurry and bring it over!
C'mon, c'mon.
Get out your reading card and your library card.
Here you go.
Hey, look at this.
No one's ever checked this out.
This is a rare book.
They don't have it at the county library.
Donated
Amasawa...
Teach!
Any idea what this "Amasawa" person is like?
Geez, now I messed up.
Probably the donor of the book.
I wouldn't know about something that old.
Try asking our veteran teachers.
Shizuku!
Oh, geez!
So this is where you are!
After you said you'd be at the entrance at eleven!
You made me wait in the sun for fifteen minutes!
Now I'll get even more freckles!
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey!
Not so loud.
You worry too much about your freckles, Harada.
Teach, this is a serious problem for me!
Oh, right!
Right!
C'mon, you two.
Out, out!
That way, that way!
I did what I could, but it's not that great.
Think I should have kept it in English?
Over the green hills, white clouds drift so slow.
Near to the road that goes up to the city.
Inside the old room, by the small window.
The old dog waits for him to come back soon.
Country Road, take me home, too.
On this distant road, whose end I can't see.
West Virginia, Mountain Mamma.
To my home town, I long to see.
This isn't bad.
It sucks!
Too conventional.
You think so?
I did this one, too.
Concrete road, wherever you go.
Forests give rise to valleys far away.
Western Tokyo, on Mount Tama.
My home lies on Concrete Road.
What is this?
So, what'd you want to talk about?
You don't need any poems translated, right?
No...
Shizuku, is there anyone you like?
Huh?
I just wish it was a mutual attraction.
It's exam time, and we could work together and cheer each other up.
So there's someone you like, Yuuko?
You already got a love letter?
!
Not so loud!
When?
How is he?
Is he cute?
He's from a different class...
And he's kind of cute...
Why don't you go out with him?
You can stop if you don't like him.
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like?
!
There's no use hiding it!
C'mon!
Might as well 'fess up!
Umm... it's Su...
Su...
TSUKISHIMA!
Can you get my bag for me?
!
Sugimura!
Yeah!
That blue sports bag over there!
Aww, c'mon, Tsukishima!
Just throw it here!
Oh, shut up!
You don't even play that well!
That's mean!
I won three games as a regular!
Yuuko?
So Sugimura's the one that you like, huh?
What should I do?
He might have found out.
I was so...
Oh, don't worry.
He's too stupid to know.
What'll you do about the love letters you got?
Well...
I have to think a little longer.
I see.
You're lucky.
They don't keep telling you to "Study, study!" at your house.
It's kind of rough when they don't do that, too.
I don't know.
- Oops.
Oh, no!
- What's the matter?
I forgot my book!
I have to go back!
Want a ride back?
Nope!
You'll be late for your cram session!
- I'll call you later.
- Sure!
T... that book is...
Oh.
Is this yours?
Here you go...
Tsukishima Shizuku.
How'd you know my name?
Gee, I wonder how?
My library card.
You know, you should drop that "Concrete Road" thing.
YOU READ IT!
That jerk!
That jerk!
That jerk!
That jerk!
That jerk!
That jerk!
THAT JERK!
You should drop that Concrete Road thing...
Yeah, right! I'm back!
Sis, you were due back today?
I'm beat.
I was lucky to find someone driving this way and got a ride.
Where's Mom?
She's still at her summer class.
And Dad's at work.
Shizuku, you should clean up a little.
Did you make supper yet?
I was just going to...
What is this?
!
Shizuku, this place is a mess!
I'll go do it now.
Didn't we decide to help Mom because she's so busy?
Put away the laundry when you're done with the rice.
And I'll make dinner after I shower.
Grandma says to come on over when you're in high school.
Doing better with your studies?
If you slack off just cause Mom and Dad don't push you you'll really pay for it.
I know!
And she tried to give me some of her soy sauce.
That's so like Grandma.
Shizuku, will you get up already?
And do your own vacuuming.
I'm cleaning bedsheets, so bring yours!
And put out the futons!
Where's Mom?
She's already gone.
Hurry and clean up, then take this lunch to Dad.
What?
!
What's your problem?
You're going to the library, right?
Or should I go instead?
If so, then you clean the bathtub, the toilet, and the front entrance.
And start doing some real chores.
Then put away the futons, go shopping, and make dinner.
I'll be going!
Shizuku!
Take this to the mailbox!
What?
The mailbox!
Don't you dare look!
Don't forget to take off the clip!
Your boyfriend?
Dummy.
Hey, Kitty Cat.
On your own?
Where are you going?
Something neat outside?
Hey!
Answer me, will you?
I'm getting off here.
How 'bout you?
See ya, Kitty Cat.
Oh, a kitty!
Suginomiya Station
He's heading towards the library!
Darn, this would've made such a great story.
There he is!
Authorized Personnel Only
Authorized Personnel Only
What a steep hill!
Just how far does this go?
Kitty Cat.
Kitty Cat.
I wonder if he lives around here?
Where're you going, Kitty Cat?
Do you live around here?
I had no idea there was a place like this up here.
What a mean cat.
His walks include teasing the dog.
I wonder if he's teasing me, too?
I had no idea there were stores like this here.
What a wonderful figurine.
Are you the cat I saw earlier?
Oh, welcome!
I, umm...
No, stay right there, stay right there.
Feel free to look around.
The Baron's bored, too.
Is "Baron" the name of this figurine?
Yup.
He's Baron Vunbert von Jiekingen.
Great name, don't you think?
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
Magnificent clock, isn't it?
It was found in a castle.
It was very badly rusted.
Take a look.
How pretty.
What is it?
You'll find out when it's done.
It's really well made.
Are those dwarves?
You sure know a lot.
I see, so you know about dwarves, young lady?
Now take a look at the numbers.
Let's see if this works.
An elf!
Can you see alright?
Step up here.
Sure.
A princess?
That's right.
These two fell in love?
Yup, but they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarves.
When the clock strikes twelve, she must return past the flock to her world.
Even so, he will always appear at that time and wait for the princess.
The artisan who made this clock probably had an unrequited love.
So that's why the two seemed sort of sad.
Is this clock running fast?
Uh, maybe by five minutes.
Oh, no!
I gotta get to the library!
Goodbye!
Can I come visit again, sir?
Sure!
If you're going to the library, you should go left!
I'm right above the library!
I've found a cool place!
This store's like right out of a story!
This is great!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
This is yours, right?
Kinda forgetful, aren't you?
Thank you.
But how...?
Gee, I wonder how?
The cat!
Is... is that cat yours?
You sure eat a pretty big lunch!
WRONG!
Concrete road, wherever you go...
YOU'RE WRONG!
HEY!
Oh, you're here already?
What's with the scary face?
It's kinda hard to explain.
Huh?
Something wonderful happened, like finding a cave of treasures.
Then one insensitive remark made it all collapse.
Sounds complicated.
Here to borrow books again today?
Yeah, I still have to read seven more books.
You just never change.
What about lunch?
I'll just eat out.
Oh, really.
Well, thanks.
June 16th...
Amazing...
That Amasawa guy's read this book, too.
What kind of person is he?
No, it couldn't be you!
Shizuku, hurry up!
Oh, we'll be late!
Umbrella.
The umbrella.
A new semester, and it just keeps raining.
Stop complaining.
You're studying because you want to, right?
Yes, ma'am.
Make sure you study well!
Just leave it to me.
Shizuku!
Hey!
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I hate all these tests.
We've got so many every day.
Did you answer "them?"
No.
He didn't write any more?
No.
Maybe I should just turn him down.
Maybe.
Yeah, maybe that's for the best.
Sugimura!
You'll barely make it!
I know that!
Time's up!
Hand in your tests.
Regular schedule this afternoon.
Shizuku, let's go see Miss Kousaka.
Sure.
Can we go to the teacher's lounge first?
Okay.
Hey, Tsukishima.
Check this out.
What is it?
I was guessing, but I aced it!
Oh, such a lucky guy.
I peeked during break and saw I got a perfect score.
Guess you're not just a stupid baseball player.
You know, Yuuko's good at guessing, too.
Maybe you should study together?
With Harada?
Sugimura, Sugimura!
What's up?
Did you see this?
Let's go, Shizuku.
Stop trying to get us together!
Was it obvious?
I was never good at guessing!
Sorry!
Excuse us.
The donor of a book?
And you think I would know?
Sorry to bother you during lunch.
It's this imprint here.
Let's see...
Oh, that's Amasawa!
I've read this, too.
Great book, isn't it?
Yes, definitely.
So exactly what kind of person is this Amasawa?
It was a few years ago.
He was the head of the PTA.
The PTA's...
Um, do you know his first name?
First name?
Let's see...
Mr. Kimura remember what Amasawa's name was?
You know, at Amasawa Hospital?
Amasawa?
I'm pretty sure it was Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi...
Tsukishima one of Amasawa's children is in the same grade as you.
Didn't you know that?
Wha...?
!
I, uh...
Thank you very much!
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry about that.
Shizuku, where're you going!
?
What a surprise!
I'm the one who should be surprised!
I think you owe me an explanation for this.
Oh, sorry.
Which way are you going, Shizuku?
What nerve!
Acting like he didn't even see me!
Who was that, Shizuku?
Where're you going?
That guy's a jerk!
But I won't run from him, either!
Oh, how cute!
I had to walk and carry Shizuku's lunch for her!
Tsukishima noticed boys, huh?
Hey, Teach, I think spring has finally arrived for Shizuku, too!
I told you that isn't it!
You actually met the Prince of Books, then, right?
Is he handsome?
Look, I just wondered what kind of person he is.
Hey, Yuuko.
You know the guy's name, right?
So tell us.
Yuuko!
Well, it was just a brief mention.
I think it started with "Ma" something, or Masagi whatever?
Ama...
Well, Shizuku?
Who knows?
That's just like Tsukishima to leave without hearing the whole story.
She wants to know but she doesn't want to know, right?
The hopeful heart suffers so...
Isn't it great?
Well, it's romantic, anyway.
Fine, just go on and tease me like that.
And after I wrote the verses for Country Road and all.
- You finished?
- Let's see!
Let's see!
O Great Shizuku!
Mistress of verse!
We promise to behave, so please show us!
Very well.
Actually, I'm not too confident.
I'm still not too sure what "country home" means.
So I just had to go with what I felt on that.
You outdid yourself.
Country road.
It'll take me... back to my home town.
I can feel it now, if I just keep to this far-off way, country road.
It's great, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not too hard to sing?
I think we can manage.
It'd be wasted if we gave it to the underclassmen.
We should sing this at the thank you party, too.
What?
The thank you party?
Impulsive, aren't you?
This part's good.
Living here all on my own.
Owning no possessions, I made my way out of town.
I must put my loneliness away and protect myself, and I'll learn to be strong...
All of you, school bell's ringing.
Yes, ma'am!
The sky's clear!
It's clear!
Shizuku!
You wanna go to the choir?
We'll show them this song.
It's okay, I have to go to the library.
Huh?
We've got tests tomorrow, you know.
I'll study at the library.
You really like it there!
See ya!
Bye-bye!
Harada...
Listen, I'm sorry, but can I talk to you?
Uh-huh.
I guess they're closed.
Have the flowers been watered?
The Baron's gone!
I wonder if he was sold?
World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
Atelier Chikyuu-ya Nishi Shirou
Nishi Shirou...
I wonder if he's named Nishi, too?
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
You've got a call from Yuuko!
You'll ruin your ears, Shizuku.
Yuuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
Right.
I'll be right there.
Right.
Okay, bye.
- Where're you going?
- Not too far.
What's wrong, Yuuko?
Shizuku...
What's wrong?
What's with that look?
What should I do, Shizuku?
Sugimura's friend asked him to get an answer from me.
Oh, boy...
Why do you have to be the go-between?
!
Hey!
He's just kinda stupid.
And besides, Sugimura probably doesn't know how you really feel.
I'll apologize to Sugimura.
But I can't go to school looking like this.
I'm skipping school tomorrow.
The test, too?
Yes.
I see.
Idiot.
What the hell?
I think I did pretty well.
Shizuku, library again today?
I'm going to Yuuko's place to see her.
Oh, say hi to her for us.
- Okay.
Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!
Tsukishima!
Hold up!
Look, it's about Harada and then she suddenly started to cry.
So, did I say something wrong or what?
Sugimura didn't Yuuko ask you why you did that?
Yeah.
Like I said, my friend on the team asked me...
Wrong!
She meant she really didn't want you to do that.
You understand what that means?
I don't!
Spell it out for me!
Geez, you really are stupid!
It means Yuuko's in love with you!
Huh?
!
But, then...
Man, that's a problem.
A problem...!
Poor Yuuko's the one with the problem!
She stayed home because of the shock!
B...but, I...
I'm in love with you!
Eh?
O...oh, no.
You shouldn't joke around like that!
I'm not joking!
I've been in love with you for a long time!
You can't!
I mean...
I... well... but...
Do you hate me?
Are you going out with someone?
I'm not going out with anybody...
B...but...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tsukishima, you have to tell me!
We've always been friends, so I do like you, Sugimura.
But when you mean in that way...
I'm sorry.
I can't say this right...
You mean we're just friends?
Even after this?
I see.
Dummy!
The only stupid one was yourself!
Just a minute, Tsukishima.
You got a package.
Oh, thanks so much again.
You're so nice, always giving us stuff.
Oh, don't worry, we can't eat it all anyway.
Oh, you're home?
Shizuku?
Yoo-hoo.
Did you get locked out, too?
Is this house your home?
Are you hungry?
Well, you're not cute, either.
Just like me.
Why did I have to change?
I used to be such a nice and honest kid before.
Even when I'm reading a book, I don't feel the excitement I used to.
Now it's like someone whispering in my heart, saying that I can't go on like this.
I'm not cute at all.
Hey, it's Tsukishima.
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.
Hey, Moon, aren't you here to visit?
Is the cat's name Moon?
Yeah.
Doesn't he look like a full moon?
That's why I call him Moon.
You mean Moon isn't your cat?
You can't tell cats what to do.
I think he's called "Egg" at another house.
He probably has other names.
So he's a stray, then.
That's right!
Moon commutes by taking the train.
The train?
That's right.
He was riding the train by himself.
I followed him and came here.
And then here's this wonderful store.
It's like a fairy tale inside the store.
I said some bad things about him.
I told him he wasn't cute, and that he was just like me.
Moon is like you?
You don't look alike at all!
T...that cat must be at least half ghost.
- Uh...
- And you...
Is the store owner okay?
I was wondering, since the store's been closed for a while.
Oh, he's just fine.
This store's kind of strange;
it's closed more often than not.
Oh, that's good to know.
I peeked through the window, but I couldn't see the Baron.
I thought he was sold.
Oh, the cat figurine?
Wanna see?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're floating up here.
Are you scared of heights?
No, I like high places.
It's beautiful...
The view is nicest around this time.
Over here.
That's good.
Sit over there.
The clock's gone!
Oh, the one that was there?
It was delivered today.
Come over here.
Did it get sold?
It was only here for repairs.
I see.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
It was finished the day you left your lunch here.
Oh, that lunch...
Yeah, I know it wasn't yours.
Now come here and take a look at the cat's eye.
Hurry up.
The light's starting to fade.
"Engels Zimmer."
That's German for "Angel's Room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it when he was sewing up the clothes.
It's so pretty.
The Baron won't be sold.
It's Grandpa's treasure.
His treasure?
It seems to hold some sort of fond memories for him.
Only he won't say what.
Look at it for as long as you want.
I'll be downstairs.
The light switch is over there.
Turn it on if you want.
Strange.
It's as if I've always known you.
I kept wanting to see you every once in a while.
You seem so very sad today.
Oh, are you done?
Yeah, thanks.
Uh, are you making a violin?
Y...yeah.
Can I see?
Sure.
It'll look like this.
Did you make this all by hand?
Of course.
I can't believe it!
They perfected the violin's design three hundred years ago.
The quality of its sound is determined by the skill of the maker.
Did you make all those, too?
'Course not!
We hold violin making classes here.
But you made one of them, didn't you?
Yeah.
Which one is it?
That one.
Wow!
This one?
It's amazing that you could make this.
It's like magic.
Geez, you sure know how to embarrass a guy.
What's wrong with that?
It's only what I think.
Anybody can make something like that.
I'm still not very good.
So, can you play the violin?
Sort of.
Will you play for me?
Just a little bit?
Oh, c'mon!
Please!
Please!
Pretty please!
Fine, but you have to sing!
What?
F...forget it!
I can't sing!
That's perfect, then.
Sing.
I'm sure you know this song.
?
No one is with me. ?
?
Going fearlessly. ?
?
That's the way I live in the dream I saw. ?
?
I must put my loneliness away... ?
?
...and protect myself and I'll learn to be strong... ?
?
Country road, it'll take me... ?
?
...back to my home town. ?
?
I can feel it now, if I just keep to... ?
?
...this far-off way, country road. ?
?
It won't matter how lonely the times get. ?
?
You'll never see me cry, I'll keep my tears at bay. ?
?
I know I must take heart, ?
?
and that hurrying is all I can do. ?
?
Only that way, can I forget. ?
?
Country road, it may take me... ?
?
...back to my home town, but even so. ?
?
Steeling my heart, ?
?
I will not go now, ?
?
not while I'm free...
country road. ?
?
Country road, come tomorrow... ?
?
...
I'll feel just like always. ?
?
I want to go home, but I can't go home. ?
?
So it's goodbye... ?
?
...country road. ?
That was great!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
Thank you so much for last time.
I was hoping to see you again, young lady.
These two are my musician friends.
Nice vocals.
So you're the lucky girl who was here when the clock was finished.
That's a cute friend you have there, Seiji.
Huh?
Seiji?
!
Does that mean your name is Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah.
Oh, didn't I tell you my name?
No, you didn't!
But the sign outside says Nishi!
That's my grandfather's name.
My name's Amasawa.
This is terrible!
What a shock!
My world's collapsing!
It's like the sky is falling!
What're you babbling about?
It doesn't matter what my name is, does it?
Yes, it does!
You're the one who didn't give your full name!
Well, it's your fault for not asking!
I never had a chance to ask you!
Oh,
I was so sure Amasawa Seiji was...
What?
I thought you'd be a nice, quiet guy!
Well, look at you!
You read too much!
Yeah?
Well, you read a lot yourself!
That sure was fun.
Everybody was so nice.
You should visit again.
Grandpa and the others would love it.
Maybe only to listen.
Singing's too tough for me.
But you're really good with the violin.
Is that what you want to do?
There're tons of people like me out there.
And besides, I want to make violins.
Really?
But you play it so well...
There's a violin crafting school in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there after junior high.
You're not going to high school?
My family's against it.
So I'm not sure yet what I'll do.
Grandpa is the only one supporting me on this.
It's great that you already know what you want to do.
Me, I still don't know what I want to do.
I'm just living life day by day.
Well, I haven't decided if I'll go yet.
I argue with my parents every day.
Even if I can go,
I won't know if I have any talent for it without trying first.
You sure you don't need a ride?
Yeah.
It's just over there.
See you.
Oh, Tsukishima.
What is it?
You know, you have a talent for lyrics.
And you sang pretty well earlier.
I like your Concrete Road a lot, too.
What?
After you told me I should drop it?
Did I really say that?
Yes, you did!
Really?
Thanks for today.
Goodbye!
Shizuku, turn off the lamp.
You left it on last night.
Hey, Sis.
When did you decide on your career?
What?
Your career!
So you're applying at Sugino Miya?
That's not what I said.
Well, that's what you go to college for.
Good night.
Good night.
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up just because she had the day off!
Good morning.
Good morning.
You should run faster.
You can go ahead.
First period, self study.
Do pages 32-33.
I'm saved...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
What a face!
Say, you got over it pretty fast.
Were you out walking with a guy from another class last night?
What?
!
Who's been saying that?
!
Just a rumor.
They say you looked like a couple.
That's not how it was.
Harada,
I should've refused to do my friend's favor.
I'm sorry.
No.
I should be the one to apologize.
It's okay.
Hey, did you watch Sasuke last night?
It was great!
I was so moved!
This formula will be on the midterm!
So remember it well!
What?
!
Oh, man!
That's all!
Excuse me, is Tsukishima here?
Oh, Amasawa.
What's up?
Tsukishima's in this class, right?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Hey, Tsukishima!
Someone ta see you!
It's a guy!
See?
There she is.
Seiji!
Tsukishima, got a minute?
Y...yes!
Whoa!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
Boyfriend!
Boyfriend!
You're wrong!
That's not it at all!
Well?
What is it?
I've decided to go to Italy.
Huh?
Let's go this way.
Where're we going?
The roof!
Look at that.
How could you call me with so many people around?
Sorry.
I just wanted you to be the first to know.
It...it's not like I care if people get the wrong idea...
My dad finally gave in.
But under certain conditions.
Huh?
What?
Grandpa's friend introduced me to someone there and I'll be his apprentice for 2 months.
Apprentice?
He's a very strict person, and he'll see if I have the necessary talent.
And he said that if I do this, I'll know whether I can handle it.
If I can't do it, I have to go back to school.
Actually, I don't really like it.
It's almost like they want me to fail.
But it's a chance for me to go.
When...?
When will you be leaving?
I have to get my passport.
My dad and I will be talking to the school today.
So you're leaving soon.
That's great!
You've got your wish!
Yeah.
Anyway, I'll just have to do my best.
- Um...
- You...
The rain's stopped.
You're right.
Wow, look at that!
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.
Yeah.
I wonder what kind of place Cremona is.
Hopefully it's a nice town.
Yeah.
They say it's an old city.
And there are lots of people there who are violin makers.
That's so great.
You're already starting to fulfill your life's ambition.
I feel like such an idiot.
Thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to go to high school with Seiji?"
But it's depressing to think how far behind you I am.
They're here.
You know, I noticed you from the library cards a long time ago.
I bet you never noticed how many times I passed by you at the library.
I even sat right next to you once.
What?
I had to read lots of books just so my name was on the card before yours.
I...
When I go to Italy,
I'll sing your song and work really hard.
I...
I will...
Don't push, you idiot!
HEY!
Watch it!
Tsukishima's pissed!
I'm scared!
Here she comes!
Here.
Oh, thanks.
May I be excused?
Shizuku, is that all you're going to eat?
I'm supposed to meet Yuuko.
If you're going near the train station, buy some milk.
What?
You're the one who drank it all, Shizuku!
She's been so lazy lately.
Sorry!
Were you waiting long?
It's okay.
I'm so confused right now.
Oh, Shizuku.
Nice to see you.
Good evening.
Welcome home.
Excuse us.
I'll make some tea.
Come get it when it's ready.
Okay!
I've been arguing with Father, so I'm not speaking to him.
Guys are so cool, though.
He said that he's coming back in two months, but if he graduates he's going right back for ten years.
That's almost like being apart forever!
But isn't there like a bond between the two of you?
I think it's great!
But he's so much better than me.
Even though we read the same books, that's all I did.
He already knows what he wants to do.
You really think so?
That's right.
Wasn't Kinu in his class that first year?
She said that he's kinda hard to get along with but he's handsome and he's good at school.
So what if he is?
You don't have to say it so bluntly.
Now I'm all depressed.
But why?
You like him, so what's wrong?
And he said he likes you, didn't he?
But I just can't believe it.
Well, I don't get it.
If it was me, I'd write letters every day and expect letters every day to keep our spirits up.
How can I tell someone who's better than me to do his best?
I don't know.
Listening to you, I don't know what you're looking for in a boyfriend.
Or are you thinking that you can't find love until you've found a career?
You have your talents too, Shizuku.
The underclassmen were all ecstatic over your translation of Country Road.
Unlike me, you can say what you feel.
"There're tons of people like me out there."
Huh?
That's what he said.
He said that he was going to test his ability.
So I have to try too.
I've decided.
I'm going to write a story.
I know what I want to write.
If he's going to try, then I'll try too.
But midterms are almost here.
No problem.
Thanks, Yuuko.
I feel more confident now.
You're going home?
Yep.
Thanks, I have to go.
Say hi to your mom for us.
Sure.
You do your best, too, Yuuko.
Right.
I'm sure Sugimura will notice your good points too.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Gee, that was pretty easy.
I'll just have to give it a try, too.
Moon!
Muta!
Muta!
Mom, Muta's gone again!
Muta!
So it's Muta, huh?
"Whisper of the heart" Listen to the forest sounds.
They come from the faraway stars.
The memory of the winds.
The clouds...
Oh, so the Baron's your main character?
Can I use him, please?
Seiji told me that you really treasure this figurine.
And that's why you're...?
Of course, go ahead.
But on one condition.
Yes?
I want to be the first person to read your story.
W...well, uh...
What do you think?
Do I really have to show it to you?
Besides, I still don't know if I can really write.
Well, that's just like us artisans.
You can't expect perfection when you're just starting.
Oh yes.
I have something nice I want you to see.
Here we go.
Take a look.
This kind of rock is called mica-slate.
Take a look inside that crack.
Right.
Like that.
It's beautiful!
That's called beryl.
It contains pieces of raw emeralds.
Emerald...
the precious jewel?
That's right.
Both you and Seiji are like that rock.
Like a natural, still unpolished stone.
I happen to like things like that.
But making violins and writing stories are different.
You have to find the raw jewel inside and spend the time to polish and refine it.
It's time-consuming work.
Can you see the big raw jewel inside that rock?
Yes.
The truth is that if you polish and refine it, you'll find that it won't look very good.
The smaller ones deep inside are more pure.
In fact, there may be even better jewels inside where you can't see them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When you get old, you start rambling.
That's not good.
I'm scared to find out whether there's anything this pretty inside myself.
But I still want to write.
If I write it, then you'll definitely be the first to read it.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.
A jewel...
Maybe a vein of lapis lazuli...
Come!
I will be your escort!
Let us go and find the deposit of lapis lazuli!
You have nothing to fear.
Space is distorted on the days of the New Moon.
That which is far will seem large.
And what is near will seem small.
But it only appears that way.
Now fly!
We'll catch an ascending wind!
We must hurry!
The planetoids are gathering!
Excellent!
We're riding the wind!
At this rate, we shall soon pass that tower.
Are we that high up?
Hardly.
Once we're closer, it will not seem so at all.
"Now go without fear."
"When the winds distort in the afternoon, even the stars will be in reach!"
Huh?
It's unusual to see
Shizuku look for something besides storybooks.
This person's making a violin in prison.
Seiji!
I thought you'd left already!
From what Grandpa said, I thought you might be here.
I'm glad I found you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
It's okay.
I'll wait here until you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
It's okay, I'm really happy you came to see me.
I can't see you off, but I'll wait for you to come back.
Sure.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry for complaining all the time.
I'll be doing my best, too.
Well, I'm off, then.
Have a safe trip!
My fiancee Louise and I are from a town in a far-away foreign land.
And in that town, magic is still alive.
The craftsmen with magic in their blood made many things in their shops.
The one who created us was a poor apprentice in a figurine shop.
Nevertheless, Louise and I were very happy.
He created us to express his unrequited love.
However...
Shizuku.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's wrong?
Tsukishima!
I...
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
I'm sorry.
Harada, you read it instead.
Yes, sir.
What!
?
You were up 'til four again!
?
Don't worry.
I wasn't sleepy at all.
But, Shizuku, you've been blanking out a lot lately.
Like earlier.
I was just thinking.
There's so much to write, I don't know how to organize it.
I've lost my appetite.
Oh, you're here, Shizuku.
Look at this, you didn't even turn on the lights.
And I wish you would've put away the laundry.
Shizuku!
Come here for a second, Shizuku.
Where's Shizuku?
Is she home?
Said she didn't want any.
Oh, I've been expecting you.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way, please.
Is the Career Counseling Room open?
Yeah.
This way.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're back early today, Shiho.
I'm exhausted.
Want some coffee?
That sounds great.
Mother, I want to ask you something.
What is it?
I've been thinking of moving out.
I've already found a place.
But won't that cost a lot?
It's okay.
I've saved up some money from work.
I found a position at the cram school so it'll be okay.
I see.
I've relied on you to do a lot of the housework, you know.
Good luck, then.
I'll tell your father.
Really?
!
That's great!
It'll be kinda tough until spring, but if I graduate, I'll be going to work, too.
When I do, I can help you out.
Sure.
I'd appreciate it.
I'm sorry to do it during such a bad time.
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate your helping with my data.
Shizuku will have more room and she'll be able to concentrate on studying.
She's been acting strange lately.
So you think so too?
I was called to her school today.
Look at this.
What is it?
I can't believe this!
She must've gone down a hundred places!
What is she so obsessed with, sitting at her desk there?
Oh, good evening.
Welcome back.
Oh, excuse me.
Just what kind of high school are you planning to attend with those scores?
!
Fine!
I won't go to high school then!
You're not going...?
!
Don't think life is going to be that easy!
What will you do with only a junior high education?
!
I'll decide for myself what I want to do!
Don't you talk back to me!
You're refusing to face reality!
Don't you know that your rank after second semester goes on your record?
Oh, and is studying all that great?
!
Now that you're in college, all you're doing are part-time jobs, Sis!
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do!
You're the one who's running away from what you're supposed to do!
Can't you see that?
!
I'm not running away!
I just have something more important to do!
What's this important thing?
Come on and show me!
Shiho, Shizuku, stop arguing.
But, Father!
Shizuku won't listen to me!
Well, both of you come here.
Let me hear your reasons.
Shizuku, you should change out of those clothes.
Hurry up.
I see.
Shizuku, is what Shiho says true?
It's not like I don't care about my tests!
But you just said you weren't going to attend high school.
That's because you said I can't get into any high school!
Shiho, I want to talk to Shizuku alone.
Will you please wait outside?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanaka's.
I'm home.
Welcome back, Mother.
Is your Father back?
Yeah.
Will you come in here, too, dear?
Shiho has been telling me about Shizuku.
Yes, dear.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now more important than your studies?
Will you tell us what it is you're doing?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Shizuku, is this something you have to do now?
But there's no time!
I only have three more weeks to do it!
I've decided to test myself during this time!
I have to do it!
Test yourself on what?
What are you testing?
We won't know if you don't tell us.
You can't even tell your father or your mother?
Dear.
Oh, sorry.
Habit.
I've noticed that you're putting a lot of effort into something at the library.
I can respect that.
Should we let Shizuku do what she wants, dear?
It's not as if there's only one way to live your life.
Well, I've had times like this in my life, too.
All right, Shizuku.
You'll have to do as you believe.
But it'll be very tough to find your own way.
If anything happens, you'll have no one to blame.
And please be present when we're eating dinner.
That's right.
You're part of the family too, you know.
Yes.
Go call Shiho in here.
- I'll make some tea.
- Fine.
Shizuku.
Father just said "Oh well", but I think he really wanted you to study more.
I know that!
I could see it written on his face!
I'm going to be moving out this coming Sunday.
You'll have the room to yourself.
You're moving out, Sis?
Yup.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one of them is real!
Which one?
Which one's the real one?
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Louise, you've come for me.
I'm already an old man.
Shizuku!
Please, come in.
Oh, I must've fallen asleep.
Please excuse me, but I've brought you my manuscript.
Does that mean you're finished?
As I promised.
Please be the first one to read this.
This is pretty long!
WHISPER OF THE HEART The Story As Told by the Baron by Tsukishima Shizuku
Um, will you read it right now?
I'll wait however long it takes.
But, after putting so much work into this,
I wanted to take time to read it carefully.
If you don't like it, just stop reading it!
I mean, if this isn't a bother.
I, um...
I'm so nervous right now.
I understand.
I'll read it right away.
Come, let's sit by the fire.
It'll be cold today.
Now no one will bother us.
Um, is it okay if I wait downstairs?
Hm?
I'll be fine.
I'm not cold at all.
I don't mind, but...
So there you are.
Shizuku, I've finished reading it.
Thank you.
It was great!
That's not true!
That's not true!
Tell me the truth, please!
I couldn't even organize the story!
The second half is all messed up!
I realize it myself!
That's true.
It's a bit rough, unpolished, and incomplete.
Just like Seiji's violins!
You've shown me the very first jewel you've crafted.
I know you tried hard.
You did great.
There's no reason to hurry.
Take your time and polish it up.
Come on, it's cold out here.
Let's go in.
I...
I found out after I wrote the whole thing!
Just wanting to write isn't enough!
I need to study more!
But...
Seiji is going so much faster than I am!
I forced myself to write it, but I was so scared!
I was so scared!
You really like Seiji, don't you?
How does it taste?
It tastes great.
I had ramen with Seiji, too.
The first time he made a violin.
That was a jumbo serving too.
Ah, thank you.
Well, how far did we get before?
You were a transfer student in Germany and you found the Baron at a cafe.
Right, right.
It's sort of melancholy, but I was attracted by his expression.
I pleaded with the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't do it.
He said, "This feline Baron has a companion."
"You can't separate two lovers like that."
The Baron is awaiting the return of his Baroness, who was sent out for repairs.
But that's just like my story.
That's right!
What a coincidence, huh?
It was almost the day I had to go home, so I thought I had to give up.
But then, my girlfriend spoke up.
She said that when the Baron's companion returned she would make sure that the two figurines stayed together.
The proprietor finally gave in.
I only took the Baron with me when I moved and left the other behind.
I told my girlfriend to hold onto the figurine for me until I came back for her.
I told her that the two figurines would meet when the two of us meet again.
But the war started right after that.
And I couldn't keep my promise.
When I finally went back to that town, I searched all over.
But in the end I couldn't find either her or the Baron's love.
She was very important to you, wasn't she?
The Baron was really just a sad part of my past but you've brought him alive in a story of hope.
Oh, that's right.
Now, hold out your hands.
I...
This stone is more appropriate for you.
I'm giving it to you.
Please work hard and and create your own story.
I will.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye!
I'm back.
Welcome home.
Where's Father?
Taking a bath.
What time do you think it is right now?
I'm sorry I've worried you.
As of now, I'm going back to being a regular student.
You don't have to worry anymore.
So you're done testing yourself?
For now, at least.
Have you eaten?
There's curry.
No, thanks.
Just for now, huh?
I'm coming in, Shizuku.
Go take your bath.
Sleeping like a soldier.
Well, then...
It can't be!
W...wait a minute!
It's a miracle!
I got to see you!
This isn't a dream, right?
My flight was a day early.
Get on!
Oh, wait.
You'll be cold like that.
C'mon, get on.
I'll go get my coat.
There isn't time!
Just get on.
Hold on tight now.
I really wanted to see you, Shizuku.
I don't know how long I thought, "Shizuku!"
And then, you really did poke your head out!
We're really amazing!
I wanted to see you, too.
It still feels like a dream!
How was Cremona?
It's very different from what I'd heard, but I'll still do it.
Wow, it's getting really light.
Should I get off?
It's okay.
I decided I wanted to take this hill with you on the bike!
That's not fair at all!
I don't want to be just a piece of luggage!
I want to be doing something, too!
All right!
Please help.
Just a little farther.
Shizuku!
Hurry and get on!
'Kay.
We're in time!
- Need a hand?
- I'm fine.
This way.
Incredible!
The morning mist looks almost like the ocean!
This is my own secret place.
It's almost time.
This is what I wanted you to see.
Grandpa told me what you've been doing.
I didn't do anything to help you.
I was only thinking of myself.
No.
I was doing it because of you!
I'm glad I got to challenge myself.
I learned a little more about myself.
I'm going to study harder.
I've decided that I'm going to high school, too.
Shizuku, listen...
I, uh... of course I don't mean right now, but...
Will you marry me?
!
I know I'll become a master violin maker!
And then, we can...
Yes.
You mean it?
!
I'm so glad!
I've been hoping for the same thing!
Really!
Alright!
Hold it.
The wind's pretty cold.
Shizuku, I love you!

Good evening.
Sure is hot, huh ?
I'm back.
Thanks.
Another plastic bag ?
It's just a carton of milk.
But they just give it to you.
You don't have to take it.
Oh, I'd like some, please.
And you, Father ?
Some wheat tea ?
Sure. I'll have some.
Be right there.
Thanks.
Can I use it ?
I'm printing right now.
Maybe we should buy a portable word processor after all.
This smoke stinks.
You should have gone to Kashirazaki, too, Shizuku.
It's okay, I can't keep up with Sis.
Oh yeah l've gotta go to work tomorrow.
You need a lunch ?
Don't worry, I'll eat out.
Our library's finally changing to a bar code system.
So things are really busy.
Then you are changing it.
I liked the card catalogs better.
Yeah, I do too.
Hey
Something's wrong with this composition.
What?
Where ?
Look, here
This name...
Shizuku, books are fine, but you should go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night.
I thought I remembered seeing this name...
And here, too.
This guy's amazing.
He borrowed all of them before I did.
Amasawa Seiji...
What kind of person is he ?
I wonder if he's cool or not ?
Shizuku, will you get up ?
I'm going out now !
Oh, geez.
You just slept that way?
Get the rice ready !
Have a good day.
What ?
!
It's that late ?
!
I have to meet Yuuko !
My wallet !
What ?
Did you forget it again ?
Yeah !
That's strange.
is it next to the phone ?
Here it is !
You're the one who put it there.
Oh, I'm gonna be late !
Remember to lock up !
What a ditz.
Boy, are they flying low !
Something great's gonna happen today !
Wow, it's hot.
Yoo-hoo !
How's it goin' ?
C'mon, let's do it !
Hey, Shizuku !
Hey !
Go for it !
Miss Kousaka, are you in ?
Oh, it's you, Tsukishima.
What's up ?
Can I please ask a favor ?
What kind ?
I hope it's nothing strange.
Can you open the library, please ?
The library ?
Can't you wait until they open normally ?
But I've already read all my books.
And the county library's closed today.
I've decided to read twenty books during vacation.
Twenty books?
But you're supposed to be studying for your exams.
C'mon, hurry it up.
Let's see...
Got it !
Hurry and bring it over !
C'mon, c'mon.
Get out your reading card and your library card.
Here you go.
Hey, look at this.
No one's ever checked this out.
This is a rare book.
They don't have it at the county library.
Amasawa...
Teach !
Any idea what this "Amasawa" person is like ?
Geez, now I messed up.
Probably the donor of the book.
I wouldn't know about something that old.
Try asking our veteran teachers.
Shizuku !
Oh, geez !
So this is where you are !
After you said you'd be at the entrance at eleven !
You made me wait in the sun for fifteen minutes !
Now I'll get even more freckles !
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey !
Not so loud.
You worry too much about your freckles, Harada.
Teach this is a serious problem for me !
Oh, right !
Right !
Out, out !
That way, that way !
I did what I could but it's not that great.
Think I should have kept it in English ?
"Over the green hills, white clouds drift so slow."
"Near to the road that goes up to the city.'
"lnside the old room by the small window."
"The old dog waits for him to come back soon.'
"Country Road, take me home, too."
"On this distant road, whose end I can't see."
"West Virginia, Mountain Mamma."
"To my home town, I long to see."
This isn't bad.
It sucks!
Too conventional.
You think so ?
I did this one, too.
"Concrete road, wherever you go."
"Forests give rise to valleys far away."
"'Western Tokyo, on Mount Tama."
"My home lies on Concrete Road."
What is this ?
So, what'd you want to talk about ?
You don't need any poems translated, right ?
Shizuku, is there anyone you like ?
I just wish it was a mutual attraction.
It's exam time, and we could work together and cheer each other up.
So there's someone you like, Yuuko ?
You already got a love letter ?
!
Not so loud !
When ?
How is he ?
~~ls he cute ?
He's from a different class...
And he's kind of cute...
Why don't you go out with him ?
You can stop if you don't like him.
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like ?
!
There's no use hiding it !
C'mon !
Might as well 'fess up !
Umm...
it's Su...
Su...
TSUKlSHlMA !
Can you get my bag for me ?
!
Sugimura !
Yeah !
Just throw it here !
Oh, shut up !
You don't even play that well !
That's mean !
I won three games as a regular !
Yuuko ?
So Sugimura's the one that you like, huh ?
What should I do ?
He might have found out. i was so...
Oh, don't worry.
He's too stupid to know.
What'll you do about the love letters you got ?
I have to think a little longer.
I see.
You're lucky.
They don't keep telling you to "Study, study !" at your house.
It's kind of rough when they don't do that, too.
I don't know.
Oops.
Oh, no !
What's the matter ?
I forgot my book !
I have to go back !
Nope !
You'll be late for your cram session !
I'll call you later.
Sure !
T...that book is...
Oh.
is this yours ?
Here you go...
Tsukishima Shizuku.
How'd you know my name ?
Gee, I wonder how ?
My library card.
You know you should drop that "Concrete Road" thing.
YOU READ it !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
THAT JERK !
"You should drop that Concrete Road thing..."
I'm back !
Sis, you were due back today ?
I'm beat.
I was lucky to find someone driving this way and got a ride.
Where's Mom ?
She's still at her summer class.
And Dad's at work.
Shizuku, you should clean up a little.
Did you make supper yet ?
I was just going to...
What is this ?
!
Shizuku, this place is a mess !
I'll go do it now.
Didn't we decide to help Mom because she's so busy ?
Put away the laundry when you're done with the rice.
And I'll make dinner after I shower.
Grandma says
To come on over when you're in high school.
Doing better with your studies ?
If you slack off just cause Mom and Dad don't push you you'll really pay for it.
I know !
Shizuku, will you get up already ?
And do your own vacuuming.
I'm cleaning bedsheets, so bring yours !
And put out the futons !
Where's Mom ?
She's already gone.
Hurry and clean up then take this lunch to Dad.
What ?
!
What's your problem ?
You're going to the library, right ?
Or should I go instead ?
If so, then you clean the bathtub, the toilet
And the front entrance.
And start doing some real chores.
Then put away the futons, go shopping, and make dinner.
I'll be going !
Shizuku !
Take this to the mailbox !
What ?
The mail
BOX...ah
Don't you dare look !
Don't forget to take off the clip !
Your boyfriend ?
Dummy.
Hey, Kitty Cat.
On your own ?
Where are you going ?
Something neat outside ?
Hey !
Answer me, will you ?
I'm getting off here.
How 'bout you ?
See ya, Kitty Cat.
He's heading towards the library !
Darn, this would've made such a great story.
There he is !
What a steep hill !
Just how far does this go ?
Kitty Cat.
Kitty Cat.
I wonder if he lives around here ?
Where're you going, Kitty Cat ?
Do you live around here ?
I had no idea there was a place like this up here.
What a mean cat His walks include teasing the dog.
I wonder if he's teasing me, too ?
I had no idea there were stores like this here.
What a wonderful figurine.
Are you the cat l saw earlier ?
Oh, welcome !
I, umm...
No, stay right there, stay right there.
Feel free to look around.
The Baron's bored, too.
is "Baron" the name of this figurine ?
Yup.
He's Baron Vunbert von Jiekingen.
Great name, don't you think ?
Oh, thanks.
Thanks. I'm fine now.
Magnificent clock, isn't it ?
It was found in a castle.
It was very badly rusted.
Take a look.
How pretty.
What is it ?
You'll find out when it's done.
It's really well made.
Are those dwarves ?
You sure know a lot.
I see, so you know about dwarves, young lady ?
Now take a look at the numbers.
Let's see if this works.
An elf !
Can you see alright ?
Step up here.
A princess ?
That's right.
These two fell in love ?
Yup, but they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarves.
When the clock strikes twelve
She must return past the flock to her world.
Even so
He will always appear at that time
And wait for the princess.
The artisan who made this clock probably
Had an unrequited love.
So that's why the two seemed sort of sad.
is this clock running fast ?
Uh, maybe by five minutes.
Oh, no !
I gotta get to the library !
Goodbye !
Can I come visit again, sir ?
If you're going to the library you should go left !
I'm right above the library !
I've found a cool place !
This store's like right out of a story !
This is great !
Tsukishima !
Tsukishima Shizuku !
This is yours, right ?
Kinda forgetful, aren't you ?
Thank you.
But how...?
Gee, I wonder how ?
The cat !
is...is that cat yours ?
You sure eat a pretty big lunch !
WRONG !
YOU'RE WRONG !
HEY !
Oh, you're here already ?
What's with the scary face ?
It's kinda hard to explain.
Huh ?
Something wonderful happened
Like finding a cave of treasures.
Then one insensitive remark made it all collapse.
Sounds complicated.
Here to borrow books again today ?
Yeah, I still have to read seven more books.
You just never change.
What about lunch ?
I'll just eat out.
Oh, really.
Well, thanks.
June 16th...
Amazing...
That Amasawa guy's read this book, too.
What kind of person is he ?
No, it couldn't be you !
Shizuku, hurry up !
Oh, we'll be late !
Umbrella.
The umbrella.
A new semester, and it just keeps raining.
Stop complaining.
You're studying because you want to, right?
Make sure you study well !
Just leave it to me.
Shizuku !
Hey !
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I hate all these tests.
We've got so many every day.
Did you answer "them ?" No.
He didn't write any more ?
No.
Maybe I should just turn him down.
Maybe Yeah, maybe that's for the best.
Sugimura !
Tsukishima Shizuku I know that !
Time's up !
Hand in your tests.
Regular schedule this afternoon.
Shizuku, let's go see Miss Kousaka.
Can we go to the teacher's lounge first?
Okay.
Hey, Tsukishima.
Check this out.
What is it ?
I was guessing, but I aced it !
Oh, such a lucky guy.
I peeked during break and saw I got a perfect score.
Guess you're not just a stupid baseball player.
You know Yuuko's good at guessing, too.
Maybe you should study together ?
With Harada ?
Sugimura, Sugimura !
What's up ?
Did you see this ?
Let's go, Shizuku.
Stop trying to get us together !
Was it obvious ?
I was never good at guessing !
Sorry !
Excuse us.
The donor of a book ?
And you think I would know ?
Sorry to bother you during lunch.
It's this imprint here.
Let's see...
Oh, that's Amasawa !
I've read this, too.
Great book, isn't it ?
Yes, definitely.
So exactly what kind of person is this Amasawa ?
It was a few years ago.
He was the head of the PTA.
The PTA's...
Um, do you know his first name ?
First name ?
Let's see...
Mr. Kimura remember what Amasawa's name was ?
You know, at Amasawa Hospital ?
Amasawa ?
I'm pretty sure it was Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi...
Tsukishima...
one of Amasawa's children ln the same grade as you Didn't you know that ?
Wha...?
!
I, uh...
Thank you very much !
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry about that.
Shizuku, where're you going !
?
What a surprise !
I'm the one who should be surprised !
I think you owe me an explanation for this.
Oh, sorry.
Which way are you going, Shizuku ?
What nerve !
Acting like he didn't even see me !
Who was that, Shizuku ?
Where're you going ?
That guy's a jerk !
But I won't run from him, either !
Oh, how cute !
Tsukishima noticed boys, huh ?
Hey, Teach, I think spring has finally arrived for Shizuku, too !
I told you that isn't it !
You actually met the Prince of Books, then, right ?
is he handsome ?
Look, I just wondered what kind of person he is.
Hey, Yuuko.
You know the guy's name, right ?
So tell us.
Yuuko !
Well, it was just a brief mention.
I think it started with "Ma" something, or Masagi whatever ?
"Ama..."
That's just like Tsukishima to leave
Without hearing the whole story.
She wants to know but she doesn't want to know, right ?
The hopeful heart suffers so ... lsn't it great ?
Well, it's romantic, anyway.
Fine, just go on and tease me like that.
And after I wrote the verses for Country Road and all.
You finished ?
Let's see !
~~Let's see !
Great Shizuku !
Mistress of verse !
We promise to behave, so please show us !
Very well.
Actually, I'm not too confident.
I'm still not too sure what "country home" means.
So I just had to go with what I felt on that.
You outdid yourself.
"Country road." "lt'll take me, back to my home town."
"l can feel it now, if I just keep to..."
"...this far-off way, country road."
It's great, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not too hard to sing ?
I think we can manage.
It'd be wasted if we gave it to the underclassmen.
We should sing this at the thank you party, too.
What ?
The thank you party ?
Impulsive, aren't you ?
This part's good.
"Living here all on my own."
"Owning no possessions, I made my way out of town."
"l must put my loneliness away...and protect myself, I'll learn to be strong"
All of you, school bell's ringing.
Yes, ma'am !
The sky's clear !
It's clear !
Shizuku !
You wanna go to the choir?
We'll show them this song.
It's okay, I have to go to the library.
Huh ?
We've got tests tomorrow, you know.
I'll study at the library.
You really like it there !
See ya !
Bye-bye !
Harada...
Listen, I'm sorry, but can I talk to you ?
Have the flowers been watered ?
The Baron's gone !
I wonder if he was sold ?
Atelier Chikyuu-ya Nishi Shirou I wonder if he's named Nishi, too ?
Shizuku !
Shizuku !
You've got a call from Yuuko !
You'll ruin your ears, Shizuku.
Yuuko ?
I can't hear you.
Right.
I'll be right there.
Right.
Okay, bye.
Where're you going ?
Not too far.
What's wrong, Yuuko ?
Shizuku...
What's wrong ?
What's with that look ?
What should I do, Shizuku ?
Sugimura's friend asked him
To get an answer from me.
Oh, boy...
Why do you have to be the go-between ?
!
Hey !
He's just kinda stupid.
And besides, Sugimura probably doesn't know how you really feel.
I'll apologize to Sugimura.
But I can't go to school looking like this.
I'm skipping school tomorrow.
The test, too ?
Yes.
I think I did pretty well.
Shizuku, library again today ?
I'm going to Yuuko's place to see her.
Oh, say hi to her for us.
Okay.
Bye-bye !
Bye-bye !
Tsukishima !
Hold up !
Look, it's about Harada and then she suddenly started to cry.
So did I say something wrong or what ?
Sugimura didn't Yuuko ask you why you did that ?
Yeah.
Like I said, my friend on the team asked me...
Wrong!
She meant she really didn't want you to do that.
You understand what that means ?
I don't !
Spell it out for me !
Geez, you really are stupid !
It means Yuuko's in love with you !
Huh ?
!
But, then...
Man, that's a problem.
A problem...!
Poor Yuuko's the one with the problem !
She stayed home because of the shock !
B...but, I...
I'm in love with you !
O...oh, no.
You shouldn't joke around like that !
I'm not joking !
I've been in love with you for a long time !
You can't !
I mean...
I...well...but...
Do you hate me ?
Are you going out with someone ?
I'm not going out with anybody...
B...but... I'm sorry !
Wait !
Tsukishima, you have to tell me !
We've always been friends so I do like you, Sugimura.
But when you mean in that way... I'm sorry.
I can't say this right...
You mean we're just friends?
Even after this ?
Dummy !
The only stupid one was yourself !
Just a minute, Tsukishima.
You got a package.
Oh, thanks so much again.
You're so nice, always giving us stuff.
Oh, don't worry, we can't eat it all anyway.
Oh, you're home ?
Shizuku ?
Yoo-hoo.
Did you get locked out, too ?
is this house your home ?
Are you hungry ?
Well, you're not cute, either.
Just like me.
Why did I have to change ?
I used to be such a nice and honest kid before.
Even when I'm reading a book I don't feel the excitement I used to.
Now it's like someone whispering in my heart saying that I can't go on like this.
I'm not cute at all.
Hey, it's Tsukishima.
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.
Hey, Moon, aren't you here to visit ?
is the cat's name Moon ?
Doesn't he look like a full moon ?
That's why I call him Moon.
You mean Moon isn't your cat ?
You can't tell cats what to do.
I think he's called "Egg" at another house.
He probably has other names.
So he's a stray, then.
That's right !
Moon commutes by taking the train.
The train ?
That's right.
He was riding the train by himself.
I followed him and came here.
And then here's this wonderful store.
It's like a fairy tale inside the store.
I said some bad things about him.
I told him he wasn't cute, and that he was just like me.
Moon is like you ?
You don't look alike at all !
T...that cat must be at least half ghost.
And you... ls the store owner okay ?
I was wondering, since the store's been closed for a while.
Oh, he's just fine.
This store's kind of strange it's closed more often than not.
Oh, that's good to know.
I peeked through the window
But I couldn't see the Baron.
I thought he was sold.
Oh, the cat figurine ?
Wanna see ?
Come on.
Close the door
It's like we're floating up here.
Are you scared of heights ?
No, I like high places.
It's beautiful...
The view is nicest around this time.
Over here.
That's good.
Sit over there.
The clock's gone !
Oh, the one that was there ?
It was delivered today.
Come over here.
Did it get sold ?
It was only here for repairs.
I see.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
It was finished the day you left your lunch here.
Oh, that lunch...
Yeah, I know it wasn't yours.
Now come here and take a look at the cat's eye.
Hurry up.
The light's starting to fade.
"Engels Zimmer."
That's German for "Angel's Room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it when he was sewing up the clothes.
It's so pretty.
The Baron won't be sold.
It's Grandpa's treasure.
His treasure ?
It seems to hold some sort of memories for him.
Only he won't say what.
Look at it for as long as you want.
I'll be downstairs.
The light switch is over there.
Turn it on if you want.
Strange.
It's as if I've always known you.
I kept wanting to see you every once in a while.
You seem so very sad today.
Oh, are you done ?
Yeah, thanks.
Uh, are you making a violin ?
Y...yeah.
Can I see ?
Sure.
It'll look like this.
Did you make this all by hand ?
Of course.
I can't believe it !
They perfected the violin's design three hundred years ago.
The quality of its sound is determined by the skill of the maker.
Did you make all those, too ?
Course not !
We hold violin making classes here.
But you made one of them, didn't you ?
Yeah.
Which one is it ?
That one.
Wow !
This one ?
It's amazing that you could make this.
It's like magic.
Geez, you sure know how to embarrass a guy.
What's wrong with that ?
It's only what I think.
Anybody can make something like that.
I'm still not very good.
So, can you play the violin ?
Sort of.
Will you play for me ?
Just a little bit ?
Oh, c'mon !
Please !
Please !
Pretty please !
Fine, but you have to sing !
What ?
F...forget it !
I can't sing !
Sing.
I'm sure you know this song.
No one is with me.
Going fearlessly.
That's the way I live in the dream I saw.
I must put my loneliness away...and protect myself and I'll learn to be strong...
Country road, it'll take me...
back to my home town.
I can feel it now, if I just keep to ...this far-off way, country road.
It won't matter how lonely the times get You'll never see me cry
I'll keep my tears at bay.
I know I must take heart
And that hurrying is all I can do Only that way, can I forget
Country road, it may take me...
back to my home town, but even so.
Steeling my heart, I will not go now not while I'm free country road.
Country road, come tomorrow...
So it's goodbye...country road.
That was great !
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
Thank you so much for last time.
I was hoping to see you again, young lady.
These two are my musician friends.
So you're the lucky girl
Who was here when the clock was finished.
That's a cute friend you have there, Seiji.
Huh ?
Seiji ?
!
Does that mean your name is Amasawa Seiji ?
Yeah.
Oh, didn't I tell you my name ?
No, you didn't !
But the sign outside says Nishi !
That's my grandfather's name.
My name's Amasawa.
This is terrible !
What a shock !
My world's collapsing !
It's like the sky is falling !
What're you babbling about ?
It doesn't matter what my name is, does it ?
Yes, it does !
You're the one who didn't give your full name !
Well, it's your fault for not asking !
I never had a chance to ask you !
Oh, I was so sure Amasawa Seiji was...
What ?
I thought you'd be a nice, quiet guy !
Well, look at you !
You read too much !
Yeah ?
Well, you read a lot yourself !
That sure was fun.
Everybody was so nice.
You should visit again.
Grandpa and the others would love it.
Maybe only to listen.
Singing's too tough for me.
But you're really good with the violin.
Is that what you want to do ?
There're tons of people like me out there.
And besides, I want to make violins.
Really ?
But you play it so well...
There's a violin crafting school
In Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there after junior high.
You're not going to high school ?
My family's against it.
So I'm not sure yet what I'll do.
Grandpa is the only one supporting me on this.
It's great that you already know what you want to do.
Me, I still don't know what I want to do.
I'm just living life day by day.
Well, I haven't decided if I'll go yet.
I argue with my parents every day.
Even if I can go, I won't know
If I have any talent for it without trying first.
You sure you don't need a ride ?
Yeah.
It's just over there.
See you.
Oh, Tsukishima.
What is it ?
You know, you have a talent for lyrics.
And you sang pretty well earlier.
I like your Concrete Road a lot, too.
What?
After you told me I should drop it ?
Did I really say that ?
Yes, you did !
Really ?
Thanks for today.
Goodbye !
Shizuku, turn off the lamp.
You left it on last night.
Hey, Sis.
When did you decide on your career ?
What ?
Your career !
So you're applying at Sugino Miya ?
That's not what I said.
Well, that's what you go to college for.
Good night.
Good night.
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up just
Good morning.
Good morning.
You should run faster.
You can go ahead.
I'm saved...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
What a face !
It will recover so soon
Were you out walking with a guy from another class last night ?
What ?
!
Who's been saying that ?
!
Just a rumor.
They say you looked like a couple.
That's not how it was.
Harada, I should've refused to do my friend's favor.
I'm sorry.
No.
I should be the one to apologize.
It's okay.
This formula will be on the midterm !
So remember it well !
That's all !
Excuse me, is Tsukishima here ?
Oh, Amasawa.
What's up ?
Tsukishima's in this class, right ?
Tsukishima ?
Yeah, she's here.
Hey, Tsukishima !
Someone ta see you !
It's a guy !
See ?
There she is.
Seiji !
Tsukishima, got a minute ?
Y...yes !
Whoa !
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend !
That's not it at all !
Well ?
What is it ?
I've decided to go to Italy.
Huh ?
Let's go this way.
Where're we going ?
The roof !
How could you call me with so many people around ?
Sorry.
I just wanted you to be the first to know.
It...it's not like I care if people get the wrong idea...
My dad finally gave in But under certain conditions.
Huh ?
What ?
Grandpa's friend introduced me to someone there and I'll be his apprentice for 2 months.
Apprentice ?
He's a very strict person
And he'll see if I have the necessary talent.
And he said that if I do this, I'll know whether I can handle it.
If I can't do it, I have to go back to school.
Actually, I don't really like it.
It's almost like they want me to fail.
But it's a chance for me to go.
When...?
When will you be leaving ?
I have to get my passport.
My dad and I will be talking to the school today.
So you're leaving soon.
That's great !
You've got your wish !
Yeah.
Anyway, I'll just have to do my best.
The rain's stopped.
You're right.
Wow, look at that !
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.
Yeah.
I wonder what kind of place Cremona is.
Hopefully it's a nice town.
Yeah.
They say it's an old city.
And there are lots of people there who are violin makers.
That's so great.
You're already starting to fulfill your life's ambition.
I feel like such an idiot.
Thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to go to high school with Seiji ?"
But it's depressing to think how far behind you I am.
You know, I noticed you from the library cards
A long time ago.
I bet you never noticed how many times
I passed by you at the library.
I even sat right next to you once.
What ?
I had to read lots of books
Just so my name was on the card before yours.
When I go to Italy
I'll sing your song and work really hard.
I...
I will...
Don't push, you idiot !
HEY !
Watch it !
Tsukishima's pissed !
Here.
Shizuku, is that all you're going to eat ?
I'm supposed to meet Yuuko.
If you're going near the train station, buy some milk.
What ?
You're the one who drank it all, Shizuku !
She's been so lazy lately.
Sorry !
Were you waiting long ?
I'm so confused right now.
Good evening.
Welcome home.
Excuse us.
I'll make some tea.
Come get it when it's ready.
Okay !
I've been arguing with Father, so I'm not speaking to him.
Guys are so cool, though.
He said that he's coming back in two months
But if he graduates he's going right back for ten years.
That's almost like being apart forever !
But isn't there like a bond between the two of you ?
I think it's great !
But he's so much better than me.
Though we read the same books, that's all I did.
He already knows what he wants to do.
You really think so ?
That's right.
Wasn't Kinu in his class that first year ?
...but he's handsome and he's good at school.
So what if he is ?
You don't have to say it so bluntly.
Now I'm all depressed.
But why ?
You like him, so what's wrong ?
And he said he likes you, didn't he ?
But I just can't believe it.
Well, I don't get it.
If it was me, I'd write letters every day and expect letters every day to keep our spirits up.
How can I tell someone who's better than me to do his best ?
I don't know.
Listening to you
I don't know what you're looking for in a boyfriend.
Or are you thinking that
You can't find love until you've found a career ?
You have your talents too, Shizuku.
The underclassmen were all
Ecstatic over your translation of Country Road.
Unlike me
You can say what you feel.
"There're tons of people like me out there."
He said that he was going to test his ability.
So I have to try too.
I've decided.
I'm going to write a story.
If he's going to try, then I'll try too.
But midterms are almost here.
No problem.
Thanks, Yuuko.
I feel more confident now.
You're going home ?
Yep.
Thanks, I have to go.
Say hi to your mom for us.
You do your best, too Yuuko.
I'm sure Sugimura will notice your good points too.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Gee, that was pretty easy.
I'll just have to give it a try, too.
Muta !
Muta !
Mom, Muta's gone again !
Muta !
So it's Muta, huh ?
Oh, so the Baron's your main character ?
Can I use him, please ?
Seiji told me that you really treasure this figurine.
And that's why you're...?
Of course, go ahead.
But on one condition.
Yes ?
I want to be
The first person to read your story.
W...well, uh...
What do you think ?
Do I really have to show it to you ?
Besides, I still don't know if I can really write.
Well, that's just like us artisans.
You can't expect perfection when you're just starting.
Oh yes.
I have something nice I want you to see.
Here we go.
Take a look.
This kind of rock is called mica-slate.
Take a look inside that crack.
Right.
Like that.
It's beautiful !
That's called beryl.
It contains pieces of raw emeralds.
Emerald... the precious jewel ?
That's right.
Both you and Seiji are like that rock.
Like a natural, still unpolished stone.
I happen to like things like that.
But making violins
And writing stories are different.
You have to find the raw jewel inside
And spend the time to polish and refine it.
It's time-consuming work.
Can you see the big raw jewel inside that rock ?
Yes.
The truth is that if you polish and refine it
You'll find that it won't look very good.
The smaller ones deep inside are more pure.
In fact, there may be even better jewels inside
Where you can't see them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When you get old
You start rambling.
That's not good.
I'm scared to find out whether there's anything
This pretty inside myself.
But I still want to write
If I write it, you'll definitely be the first to read it.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.
A jewel...
Maybe a vein of lapis lazuli...
Let us go and find the deposit of lapis lazuli !
You have nothing to fear.
Space is distorted on the days of the New Moon.
That which is far will seem large.
And what is near will seem small.
But it only appears that way.
Now fly !
We'll catch an ascending wind !
The planetoids are gathering !
Excellent !
We're riding the wind !
At this rate, we shall soon pass that tower.
Are we that high up ?
Hardly.
Once we're closer it will not seem so at all.
Huh ?
It's unusual to see Shizuku look for something besides storybooks.
This person's making a violin in prison.
Seiji !
I thought you'd left already !
From what Grandpa said, I thought you might be here.
I'm glad I found you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
It's okay.
I'll wait here until you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
It's okay, I'm really happy you came to see me.
I can't see you off, but I'll wait for you to come back.
Sure.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry for complaining all the time.
I'll be doing my best, too.
Well, I'm off, then.
Have a safe trip !
My fiancee Louise and I are
From a town in a far-away foreign land.
And in that town, magic is still alive.
The craftsmen with magic in their blood made many things in their shops.
The one who created us was a poor apprentice in a figurine shop.
Nevertheless, Louise and I were very happy.
He created us to express his unrequited love.
However...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
Shizuku !
What's wrong ?
Tsukishima !
I...
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention !
This is important !
I'm sorry.
Harada, you read it instead.
What !
?
You were up 'til four again !
?
Don't worry.
I wasn't sleepy at all.
But, Shizuku
You've been blanking out a lot lately.
Like earlier.
I was just thinking.
There's so much to write, I don't know how to organize it.
I've lost my appetite.
Oh, you're here, Shizuku.
Look at this, you didn't even turn on the lights.
And I wish you would've put away the laundry.
Shizuku !
Come here for a second, Shizuku.
Where's Shizuku ?
is she home ?
Said she didn't want any.
Oh, I've been expecting you.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way, please.
Is the Career Counseling Room open ?
Yeah.
This way.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're back early today, Shiho.
I'm exhausted.
Want some coffee ?
That sounds great.
Mother, I want to ask you something.
What is it ?
I've been thinking of moving out.
I've already found a place.
But won't that cost a lot ?
It's okay.
I've saved up some money from work.
I found a position at the cram school, so it'll be okay.
I see.
I've relied on you to do a lot of the housework, you know.
Good luck, then.
I'll tell your father.
Really ?
!
It'll be kinda tough until spring,
If I graduate, I'll be going to work, too.
When I do, I can help you out.
Sure.
I'd appreciate it.
I'm sorry to do it during such a bad time.
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate your helping with my data.
Shizuku will have more room and she'll be able to concentrate on studying.
She's been acting strange lately.
So you think so too ?
I was called to her school today.
Look at this.
What is it ?
I can't believe this !
She must've gone down a hundred places !
What is she so obsessed with, sitting at her desk there ?
Oh, good evening.
Welcome back.
Oh, excuse me.
Just what kind of high school are you planning to attend with those scores ?
!
Fine !
I won't go to high school then !
You're not going...?
!
Don't think life is going to be that easy !
What will you do with only a junior high education ?
!
I'll decide for myself what I want to do !
Don't you talk back to me !
You're refusing to face reality !
Don't you know that your rank after second semester goes on your record ?
Oh, and is studying all that great ?
!
Now that you're in college, all you're doing are part-time jobs, Sis !
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do !
You're the one who's running away from what you're supposed to do !
Can't you see that ?
!
I'm not running away !
I just have something more important to do !
What's this important thing ?
Come on and show me !
Shiho, Shizuku, stop arguing.
But, Father !
Shizuku won't listen to me !
Well, both of you come here.
Let me hear your reasons.
Shizuku, you should change out of those clothes.
Hurry up.
I see.
Shizuku, is what Shiho says true ?
It's not like I don't care about my tests !
But you just said you weren't going to attend high school.
That's because you said I can't get into any high school !
Shiho, I want to talk to Shizuku alone.
Will you please wait outside ?
Yes.
Where's your mother ?
At the Tanaka's.
I'm home.
Welcome back, Mother.
Is your Father back ?
Will you come in here, too dear ?
Shiho has been telling me about Shizuku.
Yes, dear.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now
More important than your studies ?
Will you tell us what it is you're doing ?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Shizuku is this something you have to do now ?
But there's no time !
I only have three more weeks to do it !
I've decided to test myself during this time !
I have to do it !
Test yourself on what ?
What are you testing ?
We won't know if you don't tell us.
You can't even tell your father or your mother ?
Dear.
Oh, sorry.
Habit.
I've noticed that you're putting a lot of effort
Into something at the library.
I can respect that.
Should we let Shizuku do what she wants
Dear ?
It's not as if there's only one way to live your life.
Well, I've had times like this in my life, too.
All right
Shizuku.
You'll have to do as you believe.
But
It'll be very tough to find your own way.
If anything happens, you'll have no one to blame.
And please be present when we're eating dinner.
That's right.
You're part of the family.
Yes.
Go call Shiho in here.
I'll make some tea.
Fine.
Shizuku.
Father just said "Oh well"
But I think he really wanted you to study more.
I know that !
I could see it written on his face !
I'm going to be
Moving out this coming Sunday.
You'll have the room to yourself.
You're moving out, Sis ?
Yup.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry !
Hurry !
Hurry !
Only one of them is real !
Which one ?
Which one's the real one ?
Hurry !
Hurry !
Hurry !
Louise you've come for me.
Shizuku !
Please, come in.
Oh, I must've fallen asleep.
Please excuse me, but...
I've brought you my manuscript.
Does that mean you're finished ?
As I promised.
Please be the first one to read this.
This is pretty long !
Um, will you read it right now ?
I'll wait however long it takes.
But, after putting so much work into this
I wanted to take time to read it carefully.
If you don't like it, just stop reading it !
I mean, if this isn't a bother.
I, um...
I'm so nervous right now.
I understand.
I'll read it right away.
Come, let's sit by the fire.
It'll be cold today.
Now no one will bother us.
Um, is it okay if I wait downstairs ?
Hm ?
I'll be fine.
I'm not cold at all.
I don't mind, but...
So there you are.
Shizuku, I've finished reading it.
Thank you.
It was great !
That's not true !
That's not true !
Tell me the truth, please !
I couldn't even organize the story !
The second half is all messed up !
I realize it myself !
That's true.
It's a bit rough, unpolished, and incomplete.
Just like Seiji's violins !
You've shown me the very first jewel you've crafted.
I know you tried hard.
You did great.
There's no reason to hurry.
Take your time and polish it up.
Come on, it's cold out here.
Let's go in.
I...
I found out after I wrote the whole thing !
Just wanting to write isn't enough !
I need to study more !
But...
Seiji is going so much faster than I am !
I forced myself to write it, but I was so scared !
I was so scared !
You really like Seiji, don't you ?
How does it taste ?
It tastes great.
I had noodles with Seiji, too.
The first time he made a violin.
That was a jumbo serving too.
Ah, thank you.
Well, how far did we get before ?
You were a transfer student in Germany and you found the Baron at a cafe.
Right, right.
It's sort of melancholy
But I was attracted by his expression.
I pleaded with the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't do it.
He said, "This feline Baron has a companion."
"You can't separate two lovers like that."
The Baron is awaiting the return of his Baroness
Who was sent out for repairs.
But that's just like my story.
That's right !
What a coincidence, huh ?
It was almost the day I had to go home So I thought I had to give up.
But then, my girlfriend spoke up.
She said that when the Baron's companion returned she would make sure that the two figurines stayed together.
The proprietor finally gave in.
I only took the Baron with me when I moved
And left the other behind.
I told my girlfriend to hold onto the figurine for me
Until I came back for her.
I told her that the two figurines would meet when the two of us meet again.
But the war started right after that.
And I couldn't keep my promise.
When I finally went back to that town, I searched all over.
But in the end I couldn't find
Either her or the Baron's love.
She was very important to you, wasn't she ?
The Baron was really just a sad part of my past but you've brought him alive in a story of hope.
Oh, that's right.
Now, hold out your hands.
This stone is more appropriate for you.
I'm giving it to you.
Please work hard and create your own story.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye !
I'm back.
Where's Father ?
Taking a bath.
What time do you think it is right now ?
I'm sorry I've worried you.
As of now, I'm going back to being a regular student.
You don't have to worry anymore.
So you're done testing yourself ?
Just for now
Have you eaten ?
There's curry.
No, thanks.
Just for now, huh ?
I'm coming in, Shizuku.
Go take your bath.
Sleeping like a soldier.
Well, then...
It can't be !
W...wait a minute !
It's a miracle !
I got to see you !
This isn't a dream, right ?
My flight was a day early.
Get on !
Oh, wait.
You'll be cold like that.
C'mon, get on.
I'll go get my coat.
There isn't time !
Just get on.
Hold on tight now.
I really wanted to see you, Shizuku.
I don't know how long I thought, "Shizuku !"
And then, you really did poke your head out !
We're really amazing !
I wanted to see you, too.
It still feels like a dream !
How was Cremona ?
It's very different from what I'd heard, but I'll still do it.
Wow, it's getting really light.
Getting cold?
Should I get off ?
It's okay.
I decided...
I wanted to take this hill
With you on the bike !
That's not fair at all !
I don't want to be just a piece of luggage !
I want to be doing something, too !
All right !
Please help.
Just a little farther.
Shizuku !
Hurry and get on !
'Kay.
We're in time !
Need a hand ?
I'm fine.
This way.
Incredible !
The morning mist looks almost like the ocean !
This is my own secret place.
It's almost time.
This is what I wanted you to see.
Grandpa told me what you've been doing.
I didn't do anything to help you.
I was only thinking of myself.
No.
I was doing it because of you !
I'm glad I got to challenge myself.
I learned a little more about myself.
I'm going to study harder.
I've decided that I'm going to high school, too.
Shizuku, listen...
I, uh...of course I don't mean right now, but...
Will you marry me ?
!
I know I'll become a master violin maker !
And then, we can...
Yes.
You mean it ?
!
I'm so glad !
I've been hoping for the same thing !
Really !
Alright !
Hold it.
The wind's pretty cold.
Shizuku, I love you !
WHISPER OF THE HEART
Shizuku HONNA Yoko Seiji TAKAHASHI Issei

World Emporium' Proprietor KOBAYASHI Keiju
- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it?
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say no.
Pour me some too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please, I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's too.
No.
Onee-chan wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar code system.
I like the book cards better.
Me too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
- You're right!
- Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my professor will complain.
Note:
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Yeah.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before.
Here too.
Note:
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji.
What's he like?
Is he good-looking?
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse!
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny.
Try by the phone...
Found it!
Just where you left it...
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
Yahoo!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Try your best!
Kosaka-sensei, are you there?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
- Let me in the library!
- What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
Don't forget, you've got high school entrance exams.
- Hurry it up!
- Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Note:
Donated
"Amasawa." Sensei!
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun, I get more freckles!
S-Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Sensei!
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
White clouds spreading up over a hill
A road winds up to the town
An old house with small windows
An old dog waits for me to come home
Country road leading far away
The road to my old hometown
West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain
My good old hometown
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
Concrete roads, everywhere
Cut down all the trees Filled in the valleys
Western Tokyo
Tama Mountain
My hometown is concrete roads
What is this?
!
But what's this problem?
You don't need the lyrics yet.
No.
Are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
- Sugimura!
- That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
But what about the love letter?
I'll think about it awhile.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card.
I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
"I'd forget about Concrete Road."
Get lost!
I'm home.
Onee-chan?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little.
- What about dinner?
- I'm going to wash the rice.
What's this, Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
- Where's Mom?
- Long gone.
Put that stuff away and bring Dad's lunch to him.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper clip off.
- Your boyfriend?
- Idiot!
Hey, cat, are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story.
There he is!
Note:
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here.
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either.
Beautiful doll!
Are you that cat?
- Oh, hello.
- Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll the Baron?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
I'm fine now.
- That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look.
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So, you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
- A princess?
- That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 she is changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad.
This clock's fast, isn't it?
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Goodbye.
Can I come back sometime?
Sure, but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
- Thanks, but how?
- Guess!
The cat.
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
Concrete roads, everywhere...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are.
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
- Getting more books?
- Seven more to go.
- Still at it?
What about lunch?
- I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
- Shizuku!
- Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
- I hate all these tests!
- One every day!
- Did you answer?
- No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Kosaka-sensei.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So, you're not just a baseball goof.
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me.
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr. Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Kimura-sensei, do you remember that Dr. Amasawa's given name?
Dr. Amasawa?
It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.
Amasawa Koichi.
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Umm...
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over.
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...
Right, Shizuku?
Dunno...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't.
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
Oh, Shizuku-sama!
Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old hometowns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
Country road, this old road
If I go right to the end
Got a feeling it'll take me
To that town, country road
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank you!
There too?
!
- Slow down!
- I like this part.
"I left because I was alone and I had nothing.
Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong..."
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow.
- I'll study there.
- Bookworm!
- Later.
- Bye-bye.
Harada.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.
Note:
World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
Nishi Shiro.
Maybe that jerk's name is Nishi too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko-chan's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
- Shizuku!
- What's the matter?
What's with this face?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Huh?
That's bad.
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him.
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
I see.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
I see.
Say hello to her.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada...
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, "Why you, of all people," didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend.
But...
- I'm sorry!
- Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see.
I'm the one who's dense.
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you again.
You don't have to do this.
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home.
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, "Things aren't that easy."
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him being called Ball at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds.
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil...
- Um...
- Would you?
Is your grandfather all right?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer: "angel's room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you.
You look sad today, somehow.
- Had enough?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
- Sure!
- Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
- But one of them is yours?
- Yeah.
- Which one?
- That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please, please, please!
You have to sing too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
Had a dream of living on my own
With no fear of being all alone
Pushed my sadness down inside of me
And pretended I was strong as I could be
Country road, this old road
If you go right to the end
Got a feeling it'll take me
To that town, country road
It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be
I will never ever let a tear show in my eye
If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to
Push away memories
Country road, this old road
Could go right to my hometown
I won't go there, I can't go there
Can't go down that country road
Country road, when tomorrow comes
I'll be like I always am
Want to go back there Can't go back there
Fare thee well
Country road
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock.
Seiji-kun has some pretty friends.
Seiji?
Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah.
Didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says Nishi outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah.
You're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked Concrete Roads too.
You told me to forget that!
- Did I say that?
- Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled, so now she sleeps in!
- Morning!
- Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Note:
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada, I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the midterm, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji-kun?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
- I'm going to Italy.
- What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon then.
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
- The rain's stopping.
- Yeah.
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow.
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school.
What a stupid thing to think.
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
- Hello, Shizuku-chan.
- Hello.
- Welcome back.
- Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books, except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah.
Kinu-chan was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure.
I don't get it.
I'd write every day.
We'd encourage each other.
You can't say "Go for it" to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of Country Roads.
You can express yourself too, unlike me.
"There's lots as good as me."
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time.
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it too.
Sugimura will realize.
Bye.
Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
Muta...
Note: 'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji-kun says the doll is a treasure of yours.
You didn't have to ask.
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not.
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called mica slate.
Look at the seam.
Like that.
It's beautiful!
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.
- Emerald?
The jewel?
- Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins or writing stories is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell.
Seiji-kun!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
Glad I met you before.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
Yeah.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived, and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll maker's apprentice who fashioned us, but Luisa and I were happy
because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until four again?
!
It's OK.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So, you are home.
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm home!
Welcome back.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
- I've found a place.
- But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working, but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Not going to high school?
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle school education?
I can decide my own future!
Don't get too cocky!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.
But Dad, listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho, can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
- Where's your mother?
- At the Tanakas.
- I'm back.
- Hi, Mom.
- Is your dad back?
- Yes.
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
- Dear!
- Oh, sorry.
Just one moment.
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
- Yeah.
We're a family.
- Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku.
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So, smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa, you've finally come, but I've grown so old.
Shizuku-san.
Come in.
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
Note:
Whisper of the Heart It's a novel!
Note:
Whisper of the Heart
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding.
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course, but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku-san, I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished, just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now...
Now that I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more, but Seiji-kun's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared.
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...
Yes, yes.
He looked so melancholic.
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes, quite the coincidence.
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back, she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you.
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes.
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
Sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So, your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry.
I'm fine!
"For now."
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No way!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait, you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
"Shizuku!"
And then you appeared!
What a team we are!
Me too.
It's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
- Shall I get off?
- It's OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.
No, you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku.
I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait, it's cold.
Shizuku, I love you!

Good evening.
Sure is hot, huh ?
I'm back.
Thanks.
Another plastic bag ?
It's just a carton of milk.
But they just give it to you.
You don't have to take it.
Oh, I'd like some, please.
And you, Father ?
Some wheat tea ?
Sure.
I'll have some.
Be right there.
Thanks.
Can I use it ?
I'm printing right now.
Maybe we should buy a portable word processor after all.
This smoke stinks.
You should have gone to Kashirazaki, too, Shizuku.
It's okay, I can't keep up with Sis.
Oh yeah
I've gotta go to work tomorrow.
You need a lunch ?
Don't worry, I'll eat out.
Our library's finally changing to a bar code system.
So things are really busy.
Then you are changing it.
I liked the card catalogs better.
Yeah, I do too.
Hey
Something's wrong with this composition.
What?
Where ?
Look, here
This name...
Shizuku, books are fine, but you should go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night.
I thought I remembered seeing this name...
And here, too.
This guy's amazing.
He borrowed all of them before I did.
Amasawa Seiji...
What kind of person is he ?
I wonder if he's cool or not ?
Shizuku, will you get up ?
I'm going out now !
Oh, geez.
You just slept that way?
Get the rice ready !
Have a good day.
What ?
!
It's that late ?
!
I have to meet Yuuko !
My wallet !
What ?
Did you forget it again ?
Yeah !
That's strange.
Is it next to the phone ?
Here it is !
You're the one who put it there.
Oh, I'm gonna be late !
Remember to lock up !
What a ditz.
Boy, are they flying low !
Something great's gonna happen today !
Wow, it's hot.
Yoo-hoo !
How's it goin' ?
C'mon, let's do it !
Hey, Shizuku !
Hey !
Go for it !
Miss Kousaka, are you in ?
Oh, it's you, Tsukishima.
What's up ?
Can I please ask a favor ?
What kind ?
I hope it's nothing strange.
Can you open the library, please ?
The library ?
Can't you wait until they open normally ?
But I've already read all my books.
And the county library's closed today.
I've decided to read twenty books during vacation.
Twenty books?
But you're supposed to be studying for your exams.
C'mon, hurry it up.
Let's see...
Got it !
Hurry and bring it over !
C'mon, c'mon.
Get out your reading card and your library card.
Here you go.
Hey, look at this.
No one's ever checked this out.
This is a rare book.
They don't have it at the county library.
Amasawa...
Teach !
Any idea what this "Amasawa" person is like ?
Geez, now I messed up.
Probably the donor of the book.
I wouldn't know about something that old.
Try asking our veteran teachers.
Shizuku !
Oh, geez !
So this is where you are !
After you said you'd be at the entrance at eleven !
You made me wait in the sun for fifteen minutes !
Now I'll get even more freckles !
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey !
Not so loud.
You worry too much about your freckles, Harada.
Teach this is a serious problem for me !
Oh, right !
Right !
Out, out !
That way, that way !
I did what I could but it's not that great.
Think I should have kept it in English ?
"Over the green hills, white clouds drift so slow."
"Near to the road that goes up to the city.'
"lnside the old room by the small window."
"The old dog waits for him to come back soon.'
"Country Road, take me home, too."
"On this distant road, whose end I can't see."
"West Virginia, Mountain Mamma."
"To my home town, I long to see."
This isn't bad.
It sucks!
Too conventional.
You think so ?
I did this one, too.
"Concrete road, wherever you go."
"Forests give rise to valleys far away."
"'Western Tokyo, on Mount Tama."
"My home lies on Concrete Road."
What is this ?
So, what'd you want to talk about ?
You don't need any poems translated, right ?
Shizuku, is there anyone you like ?
I just wish it was a mutual attraction.
It's exam time, and we could work together and cheer each other up.
So there's someone you like, Yuuko ?
You already got a love letter ?
!
Not so loud !
When ?
How is he ?
~~Is he cute ?
He's from a different class...
And he's kind of cute...
Why don't you go out with him ?
You can stop if you don't like him.
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like ?
!
There's no use hiding it !
C'mon !
Might as well 'fess up !
Umm...
it's Su...
Su...
TSUKlSHlMA !
Can you get my bag for me ?
!
Sugimura !
Yeah !
Just throw it here !
Oh, shut up !
You don't even play that well !
That's mean !
I won three games as a regular !
Yuuko ?
So Sugimura's the one that you like, huh ?
What should I do ?
He might have found out.
I was so...
Oh, don't worry.
He's too stupid to know.
What'll you do about the love letters you got ?
I have to think a little longer.
I see.
You're lucky.
They don't keep telling you to "Study, study !" at your house.
It's kind of rough when they don't do that, too.
I don't know.
Oops.
Oh, no !
What's the matter ?
I forgot my book !
I have to go back !
Nope !
You'll be late for your cram session !
I'll call you later.
Sure !
T...that book is...
Oh.
Is this yours ?
Here you go...
Tsukishima Shizuku.
How'd you know my name ?
Gee, I wonder how ?
My library card.
You know you should drop that "Concrete Road" thing.
YOU READ IT !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
THAT JERK !
"You should drop that Concrete Road thing..."
I'm back !
Sis, you were due back today ?
I'm beat.
I was lucky to find someone driving this way and got a ride.
Where's Mom ?
She's still at her summer class.
And Dad's at work.
Shizuku, you should clean up a little.
Did you make supper yet ?
I was just going to...
What is this ?
!
Shizuku, this place is a mess !
I'll go do it now.
Didn't we decide to help Mom because she's so busy ?
Put away the laundry when you're done with the rice.
And I'll make dinner after I shower.
Grandma says
To come on over when you're in high school.
Doing better with your studies ?
If you slack off just cause Mom and Dad don't push you you'll really pay for it.
I know !
Shizuku, will you get up already ?
And do your own vacuuming.
I'm cleaning bed sheets, so bring yours !
And put out the futons !
Where's Mom ?
She's already gone.
Hurry and clean up then take this lunch to Dad.
What ?
!
What's your problem ?
You're going to the library, right ?
Or should I go instead ?
If so, then you clean the bathtub, the toilet
And the front entrance.
And start doing some real chores.
Then put away the futons, go shopping, and make dinner.
I'll be going !
Shizuku !
Take this to the mailbox !
What ?
The MAIL
BOX...ah
Don't you dare look !
Don't forget to take off the clip !
Your boyfriend ?
Dummy.
Hey, Kitty Cat.
On your own ?
Where are you going ?
Something neat outside ?
Hey !
Answer me, will you ?
I'm getting off here.
How 'bout you ?
See ya, Kitty Cat.
He's heading towards the library !
Darn, this would've made such a great story.
There he is !
What a steep hill !
Just how far does this go ?
Kitty Cat.
Kitty Cat.
I wonder if he lives around here ?
Where're you going, Kitty Cat ?
Do you live around here ?
I had no idea there was a place like this up here.
What a mean cat His walks include teasing the dog.
I wonder if he's teasing me, too ?
I had no idea there were stores like this here.
What a wonderful figurine.
Are you the cat I saw earlier ?
Oh, welcome !
I, umm...
No, stay right there, stay right there.
Feel free to look around.
The Baron's bored, too.
Is "Baron" the name of this figurine ?
Yup.
He's Baron Vunbert von Jiekingen.
Great name, don't you think ?
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
Magnificent clock, isn't it ?
It was found in a castle.
It was very badly rusted.
Take a look.
How pretty.
What is it ?
You'll find out when it's done.
It's really well made.
Are those dwarves ?
You sure know a lot.
I see, so you know about dwarves, young lady ?
Now take a look at the numbers.
Let's see if this works.
An elf !
Can you see alright ?
Step up here.
A princess ?
That's right.
These two fell in love ?
Yup, but they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarves.
When the clock strikes twelve
She must return past the flock to her world.
Even so
He will always appear at that time
And wait for the princess.
The artisan who made this clock probably
Had an unrequited love.
So that's why the two seemed sort of sad.
Is this clock running fast ?
Uh, maybe by five minutes.
Oh, no !
I gotta get to the library !
Goodbye !
Can I come visit again, sir ?
If you're going to the library you should go left !
I'm right above the library !
I've found a cool place !
This store's like right out of a story !
This is great !
Tsukishima !
Tsukishima Shizuku !
This is yours, right ?
Kinda forgetful, aren't you ?
Thank you.
But how...?
Gee, I wonder how ?
The cat !
Is...is that cat yours ?
You sure eat a pretty big lunch !
WRONG !
YOU'RE WRONG !
HEY !
Oh, you're here already ?
What's with the scary face ?
It's kinda hard to explain.
Huh ?
Something wonderful happened
Like finding a cave of treasures.
Then one insensitive remark made it all collapse.
Sounds complicated.
Here to borrow books again today ?
Yeah, I still have to read seven more books.
You just never change.
What about lunch ?
I'll just eat out.
Oh, really.
Well, thanks.
June 16th...
Amazing...
That Amasawa guy's read this book, too.
What kind of person is he ?
No, it couldn't be you !
Shizuku, hurry up !
Oh, we'll be late !
Umbrella.
The umbrella.
A new semester, and it just keeps raining.
Stop complaining.
You're studying because you want to, right?
Make sure you study well !
Just leave it to me.
Shizuku !
Hey !
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I hate all these tests.
We've got so many every day.
Did you answer "them ?" No.
He didn't write any more ?
No.
Maybe I should just turn him down.
Maybe Yeah, maybe that's for the best.
Sugimura !
Tsukishima Shizuku
I know that !
Time's up !
Hand in your tests.
Regular schedule this afternoon.
Shizuku, let's go see Miss Kousaka.
Can we go to the teacher's lounge first?
Okay.
Hey, Tsukishima.
Check this out.
What is it ?
I was guessing, but I aced it !
Oh, such a lucky guy.
I peeked during break and saw I got a perfect score.
Guess you're not just a stupid baseball player.
You know Yuuko's good at guessing, too.
Maybe you should study together ?
With Harada ?
Sugimura, Sugimura !
What's up ?
Did you see this ?
Let's go, Shizuku.
Stop trying to get us together !
Was it obvious ?
I was never good at guessing !
Sorry !
Excuse us.
The donor of a book ?
And you think I would know ?
Sorry to bother you during lunch.
It's this imprint here.
Let's see...
Oh, that's Amasawa !
I've read this, too.
Great book, isn't it ?
Yes, definitely.
So exactly what kind of person is this Amasawa ?
It was a few years ago.
He was the head of the PTA.
The PTA's...
Um, do you know his first name ?
First name ?
Let's see...
Mr. Kimura remember what Amasawa's name was ?
You know, at Amasawa Hospital ?
Amasawa ?
I'm pretty sure it was Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi...
Tsukishima...
one of Amasawa's children ln the same grade as you Didn't you know that ?
Wha...?
!
I, uh...
Thank you very much !
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry about that.
Shizuku, where're you going !
?
What a surprise !
I'm the one who should be surprised !
I think you owe me an explanation for this.
Oh, sorry.
Which way are you going, Shizuku ?
What nerve !
Acting like he didn't even see me !
Who was that, Shizuku ?
Where're you going ?
That guy's a jerk !
But I won't run from him, either !
Oh, how cute !
Tsukishima noticed boys, huh ?
Hey, Teach, I think spring has finally arrived for Shizuku, too !
I told you that isn't it !
You actually met the Prince of Books, then, right ?
Is he handsome ?
Look, I just wondered what kind of person he is.
Hey, Yuuko.
You know the guy's name, right ?
So tell us.
Yuuko !
Well, it was just a brief mention.
I think it started with "Ma" something, or Masagi whatever ?
"Ama..."
That's just like Tsukishima to leave
Without hearing the whole story.
She wants to know but she doesn't want to know, right ?
The hopeful heart suffers so ... Isn't it great ?
Well, it's romantic, anyway.
Fine, just go on and tease me like that.
And after I wrote the verses for Country Road and all.
You finished ?
Let's see !
~~Let's see !
Great Shizuku !
Mistress of verse !
We promise to behave, so please show us !
Very well.
Actually, I'm not too confident.
I'm still not too sure what "country home" means.
So I just had to go with what I felt on that.
You outdid yourself.
"Country road." "It'll take me, back to my home town."
"I can feel it now, if I just keep to..."
"...this far-off way, country road."
It's great, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not too hard to sing ?
I think we can manage.
It'd be wasted if we gave it to the underclassmen.
We should sing this at the thank you party, too.
What ?
The thank you party ?
Impulsive, aren't you ?
This part's good.
"Living here all on my own."
"Owning no possessions, I made my way out of town."
"I must put my loneliness away...and protect myself, I'll learn to be strong"
All of you, school bell's ringing.
Yes, ma'am !
The sky's clear !
It's clear !
Shizuku !
You wanna go to the choir?
We'll show them this song.
It's okay, I have to go to the library.
Huh ?
We've got tests tomorrow, you know.
I'll study at the library.
You really like it there !
See ya !
Bye-bye !
Harada...
Listen, I'm sorry, but can I talk to you ?
Have the flowers been watered ?
The Baron's gone !
I wonder if he was sold ?
Atelier Chikyuu-ya Nishi Shirou I wonder if he's named Nishi, too ?
Shizuku !
Shizuku !
You've got a call from Yuuko !
You'll ruin your ears, Shizuku.
Yuuko ?
I can't hear you.
Right.
I'll be right there.
Right.
Okay, bye.
Where're you going ?
Not too far.
What's wrong, Yuuko ?
Shizuku...
What's wrong ?
What's with that look ?
What should I do, Shizuku ?
Sugimura's friend asked him
To get an answer from me.
Oh, boy...
Why do you have to be the go-between ?
!
Hey !
He's just kinda stupid.
And besides, Sugimura probably doesn't know how you really feel.
I'll apologize to Sugimura.
But I can't go to school looking like this.
I'm skipping school tomorrow.
The test, too ?
Yes.
I think I did pretty well.
Shizuku, library again today ?
I'm going to Yuuko's place to see her.
Oh, say hi to her for us.
Okay.
Bye-bye !
Bye-bye !
Tsukishima !
Hold up !
Look, it's about Harada and then she suddenly started to cry.
So did I say something wrong or what ?
Sugimura didn't Yuuko ask you why you did that ?
Yeah.
Like I said, my friend on the team asked me...
Wrong!
She meant she really didn't want you to do that.
You understand what that means ?
I don't !
Spell it out for me !
Geez, you really are stupid !
It means Yuuko's in love with you !
Huh ?
!
But, then...
Man, that's a problem.
A problem...!
Poor Yuuko's the one with the problem !
She stayed home because of the shock !
B...but, I...
I'm in love with you !
O...oh, no.
You shouldn't joke around like that !
I'm not joking !
I've been in love with you for a long time !
You can't !
I mean...
I...well...but...
Do you hate me ?
Are you going out with someone ?
I'm not going out with anybody...
B...but...
I'm sorry !
Wait !
Tsukishima, you have to tell me !
We've always been friends so I do like you, Sugimura.
But when you mean in that way...
I'm sorry.
I can't say this right...
You mean we're just friends?
Even after this ?
Dummy !
The only stupid one was yourself !
Just a minute, Tsukishima.
You got a package.
Oh, thanks so much again.
You're so nice, always giving us stuff.
Oh, don't worry, we can't eat it all anyway.
Oh, you're home ?
Shizuku ?
Yoo-hoo.
Did you get locked out, too ?
Is this house your home ?
Are you hungry ?
Well, you're not cute, either.
Just like me.
Why did I have to change ?
I used to be such a nice and honest kid before.
Even when I'm reading a book
I don't feel the excitement I used to.
Now it's like someone whispering in my heart saying that I can't go on like this.
I'm not cute at all.
Hey, it's Tsukishima.
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.
Hey, Moon, aren't you here to visit ?
Is the cat's name Moon ?
Doesn't he look like a full moon ?
That's why I call him Moon.
You mean Moon isn't your cat ?
You can't tell cats what to do.
I think he's called "Egg" at another house.
He probably has other names.
So he's a stray, then.
That's right !
Moon commutes by taking the train.
The train ?
That's right.
He was riding the train by himself.
I followed him and came here.
And then here's this wonderful store.
It's like a fairy tale inside the store.
I said some bad things about him.
I told him he wasn't cute, and that he was just like me.
Moon is like you ?
You don't look alike at all !
T...that cat must be at least half ghost.
And you...
Is the store owner okay ?
I was wondering, since the store's been closed for a while.
Oh, he's just fine.
This store's kind of strange it's closed more often than not.
Oh, that's good to know.
I peeked through the window
But I couldn't see the Baron.
I thought he was sold.
Oh, the cat figurine ?
Wanna see ?
Come on.
Close the door
It's like we're floating up here.
Are you scared of heights ?
No, I like high places.
It's beautiful...
The view is nicest around this time.
Over here.
That's good.
Sit over there.
The clock's gone !
Oh, the one that was there ?
It was delivered today.
Come over here.
Did it get sold ?
It was only here for repairs.
I see.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
It was finished the day you left your lunch here.
Oh, that lunch...
Yeah, I know it wasn't yours.
Now come here and take a look at the cat's eye.
Hurry up.
The light's starting to fade.
"Engels Zimmer."
That's German for "Angel's Room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it when he was sewing up the clothes.
It's so pretty.
The Baron won't be sold.
It's Grandpa's treasure.
His treasure ?
It seems to hold some sort of memories for him.
Only he won't say what.
Look at it for as long as you want.
I'll be downstairs.
The light switch is over there.
Turn it on if you want.
Strange.
It's as if I've always known you.
I kept wanting to see you every once in a while.
You seem so very sad today.
Oh, are you done ?
Yeah, thanks.
Uh, are you making a violin ?
Y...yeah.
Can I see ?
Sure.
It'll look like this.
Did you make this all by hand ?
Of course.
I can't believe it !
They perfected the violin's design three hundred years ago.
The quality of its sound is determined by the skill of the maker.
Did you make all those, too ?
Course not !
We hold violin making classes here.
But you made one of them, didn't you ?
Yeah.
Which one is it ?
That one.
Wow !
This one ?
It's amazing that you could make this.
It's like magic.
Geez, you sure know how to embarrass a guy.
What's wrong with that ?
It's only what I think.
Anybody can make something like that.
I'm still not very good.
So, can you play the violin ?
Sort of.
Will you play for me ?
Just a little bit ?
Oh, c'mon !
Please !
Please !
Pretty please !
Fine, but you have to sing !
What ?
F...forget it !
I can't sing !
I'm sure you know this song.
No one is with me.
Going fearlessly.
That's the way I live in the dream I saw.
I must put my loneliness away...and protect myself and I'll learn to be strong...
Country road, it'll take me...
back to my home town.
I can feel it now, if I just keep to ...this far-off way, country road.
It won't matter how lonely the times get You'll never see me cry
I'll keep my tears at bay.
I know I must take heart
And that hurrying is all I can do Only that way, can I forget
Country road, it may take me...
back to my home town, but even so.
Steeling my heart, I will not go now not while I'm free country road.
Country road, come tomorrow...
So it's goodbye...country road.
That was great !
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
Thank you so much for last time.
I was hoping to see you again, young lady.
These two are my musician friends.
So you're the lucky girl
Who was here when the clock was finished.
That's a cute friend you have there, Seiji.
Huh ?
Seiji ?
!
Does that mean your name is Amasawa Seiji ?
Yeah.
Oh, didn't I tell you my name ?
No, you didn't !
But the sign outside says Nishi !
That's my grandfather's name.
My name's Amasawa.
This is terrible !
What a shock !
My world's collapsing !
It's like the sky is falling !
What're you babbling about ?
It doesn't matter what my name is, does it ?
Yes, it does !
You're the one who didn't give your full name !
Well, it's your fault for not asking !
I never had a chance to ask you !
Oh, I was so sure Amasawa Seiji was...
What ?
I thought you'd be a nice, quiet guy !
Well, look at you !
You read too much !
Yeah ?
Well, you read a lot yourself !
That sure was fun.
Everybody was so nice.
You should visit again.
Grandpa and the others would love it.
Maybe only to listen.
Singing's too tough for me.
But you're really good with the violin.
Is that what you want to do ?
There're tons of people like me out there.
And besides, I want to make violins.
Really ?
But you play it so well...
There's a violin crafting school
In Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there after junior high.
You're not going to high school ?
My family's against it.
So I'm not sure yet what I'll do.
Grandpa is the only one supporting me on this.
It's great that you already know what you want to do.
Me, I still don't know what I want to do.
I'm just living life day by day.
Well, I haven't decided if I'll go yet.
I argue with my parents every day.
Even if I can go, I won't know
If I have any talent for it without trying first.
You sure you don't need a ride ?
Yeah.
It's just over there.
See you.
Oh, Tsukishima.
What is it ?
You know, you have a talent for lyrics.
And you sang pretty well earlier.
I like your Concrete Road a lot, too.
What?
After you told me I should drop it ?
Did I really say that ?
Yes, you did !
Really ?
Thanks for today.
Goodbye !
Shizuku, turn off the lamp.
You left it on last night.
Hey, Sis.
When did you decide on your career ?
What ?
Your career !
So you're applying at Sugino Miya ?
That's not what I said.
Well, that's what you go to college for.
Good night.
Good night.
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up just
Good morning.
Good morning.
You should run faster.
You can go ahead.
I'm saved...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
What a face !
It will recover so soon
Were you out walking with a guy from another class last night ?
What ?
!
Who's been saying that ?
!
Just a rumor.
They say you looked like a couple.
That's not how it was.
Harada, I should've refused to do my friend's favor.
I'm sorry.
No.
I should be the one to apologize.
It's okay.
This formula will be on the midterm !
So remember it well !
That's all !
Excuse me, is Tsukishima here ?
Oh, Amasawa.
What's up ?
Tsukishima's in this class, right ?
Tsukishima ?
Yeah, she's here.
Hey, Tsukishima !
Someone ta see you !
It's a guy !
See ?
There she is.
Seiji !
Tsukishima, got a minute ?
Y...yes !
Whoa !
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend !
That's not it at all !
Well ?
What is it ?
I've decided to go to Italy.
Huh ?
Let's go this way.
Where're we going ?
The roof !
How could you call me with so many people around ?
Sorry.
I just wanted you to be the first to know.
It...it's not like I care if people get the wrong idea...
My dad finally gave in But under certain conditions.
Huh ?
What ?
Grandpa's friend introduced me to someone there and I'll be his apprentice for 2 months.
Apprentice ?
He's a very strict person
And he'll see if I have the necessary talent.
And he said that if I do this, I'll know whether I can handle it.
If I can't do it, I have to go back to school.
Actually, I don't really like it.
It's almost like they want me to fail.
But it's a chance for me to go.
When...?
When will you be leaving ?
I have to get my passport.
My dad and I will be talking to the school today.
So you're leaving soon.
That's great !
You've got your wish !
Yeah.
Anyway, I'll just have to do my best.
The rain's stopped.
You're right.
Wow, look at that !
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.
Yeah.
I wonder what kind of place Cremona is.
Hopefully it's a nice town.
Yeah.
They say it's an old city.
And there are lots of people there who are violin makers.
That's so great.
You're already starting to fulfill your life's ambition.
I feel like such an idiot.
Thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to go to high school with Seiji ?"
But it's depressing to think how far behind you I am.
You know, I noticed you from the library cards
A long time ago.
I bet you never noticed how many times
I passed by you at the library.
I even sat right next to you once.
What ?
I had to read lots of books
Just so my name was on the card before yours.
When I go to Italy
I'll sing your song and work really hard.
I...
I will...
Don't push, you idiot !
HEY !
Watch it !
Tsukishima's pissed !
Here.
Shizuku, is that all you're going to eat ?
I'm supposed to meet Yuuko.
If you're going near the train station, buy some milk.
What ?
You're the one who drank it all, Shizuku !
She's been so lazy lately.
Sorry !
Were you waiting long ?
I'm so confused right now.
Good evening.
Welcome home.
Excuse us.
I'll make some tea.
Come get it when it's ready.
Okay !
I've been arguing with Father, so I'm not speaking to him.
Guys are so cool, though.
He said that he's coming back in two months
But if he graduates he's going right back for ten years.
That's almost like being apart forever !
But isn't there like a bond between the two of you ?
I think it's great !
But he's so much better than me.
Though we read the same books, that's all I did.
He already knows what he wants to do.
You really think so ?
That's right.
Wasn't Kinu in his class that first year ?
...but he's handsome and he's good at school.
So what if he is ?
You don't have to say it so bluntly.
Now I'm all depressed.
But why ?
You like him, so what's wrong ?
And he said he likes you, didn't he ?
But I just can't believe it.
Well, I don't get it.
If it was me, I'd write letters every day and expect letters every day to keep our spirits up.
How can I tell someone who's better than me to do his best ?
I don't know.
Listening to you
I don't know what you're looking for in a boyfriend.
Or are you thinking that
You can't find love until you've found a career ?
You have your talents too, Shizuku.
The underclassmen were all
Ecstatic over your translation of Country Road.
Unlike me
You can say what you feel.
"There're tons of people like me out there."
He said that he was going to test his ability.
So I have to try too.
I've decided.
I'm going to write a story.
If he's going to try, then I'll try too.
But midterms are almost here.
No problem.
Thanks, Yuuko.
I feel more confident now.
You're going home ?
Yep.
Thanks, I have to go.
Say hi to your mom for us.
You do your best, too Yuuko.
I'm sure Sugimura will notice your good points too.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Gee, that was pretty easy.
I'll just have to give it a try, too.
Muta !
Muta !
Mom, Muta's gone again !
Muta !
So it's Muta, huh ?
Oh, so the Baron's your main character ?
Can I use him, please ?
Seiji told me that you really treasure this figurine.
And that's why you're...?
Of course, go ahead.
But on one condition.
Yes ?
I want to be
The first person to read your story.
W...well, uh...
What do you think ?
Do I really have to show it to you ?
Besides, I still don't know if I can really write.
Well, that's just like us artisans.
You can't expect perfection when you're just starting.
Oh yes.
I have something nice I want you to see.
Here we go.
Take a look.
This kind of rock is called mica-slate.
Take a look inside that crack.
Right.
Like that.
It's beautiful !
That's called beryl.
It contains pieces of raw emeralds.
Emerald... the precious jewel ?
That's right.
Both you and Seiji are like that rock.
Like a natural, still unpolished stone.
I happen to like things like that.
But making violins
And writing stories are different.
You have to find the raw jewel inside
And spend the time to polish and refine it.
It's time-consuming work.
Can you see the big raw jewel inside that rock ?
Yes.
The truth is that if you polish and refine it
You'll find that it won't look very good.
The smaller ones deep inside are more pure.
In fact, there may be even better jewels inside
Where you can't see them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When you get old
You start rambling.
That's not good.
I'm scared to find out whether there's anything
This pretty inside myself.
But I still want to write
If I write it, you'll definitely be the first to read it.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.
A jewel...
Maybe a vein of lapis lazuli...
Let us go and find the deposit of lapis lazuli !
You have nothing to fear.
Space is distorted on the days of the New Moon.
That which is far will seem large.
And what is near will seem small.
But it only appears that way.
Now fly !
We'll catch an ascending wind !
The planetoids are gathering !
Excellent !
We're riding the wind !
At this rate, we shall soon pass that tower.
Are we that high up ?
Hardly.
Once we're closer it will not seem so at all.
Huh ?
It's unusual to see Shizuku look for something besides storybooks.
This person's making a violin in prison.
Seiji !
I thought you'd left already !
From what Grandpa said, I thought you might be here.
I'm glad I found you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
It's okay.
I'll wait here until you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
It's okay, I'm really happy you came to see me.
I can't see you off, but I'll wait for you to come back.
Sure.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry for complaining all the time.
I'll be doing my best, too.
Well, I'm off, then.
Have a safe trip !
My fiancee Louise and I are
From a town in a far-away foreign land.
And in that town, magic is still alive.
The craftsmen with magic in their blood made many things in their shops.
The one who created us was a poor apprentice in a figurine shop.
Nevertheless, Louise and I were very happy.
He created us to express his unrequited love.
However...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
Shizuku !
What's wrong ?
Tsukishima !
I...
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention !
This is important !
I'm sorry.
Harada, you read it instead.
What !
?
You were up 'til four again !
?
Don't worry.
I wasn't sleepy at all.
But, Shizuku
You've been blanking out a lot lately.
Like earlier.
I was just thinking.
There's so much to write, I don't know how to organize it.
I've lost my appetite.
Oh, you're here, Shizuku.
Look at this, you didn't even turn on the lights.
And I wish you would've put away the laundry.
Shizuku !
Come here for a second, Shizuku.
Where's Shizuku ?
Is she home ?
Said she didn't want any.
Oh, I've been expecting you.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way, please.
Is the Career Counseling Room open ?
Yeah.
This way.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're back early today, Shiho.
I'm exhausted.
Want some coffee ?
That sounds great.
Mother, I want to ask you something.
What is it ?
I've been thinking of moving out.
I've already found a place.
But won't that cost a lot ?
It's okay.
I've saved up some money from work.
I found a position at the cram school, so it'll be okay.
I see.
I've relied on you to do a lot of the housework, you know.
Good luck, then.
I'll tell your father.
Really ?
!
It'll be kinda tough until spring,
If I graduate, I'll be going to work, too.
When I do, I can help you out.
Sure.
I'd appreciate it.
I'm sorry to do it during such a bad time.
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate your helping with my data.
Shizuku will have more room and she'll be able to concentrate on studying.
She's been acting strange lately.
So you think so too ?
I was called to her school today.
Look at this.
What is it ?
I can't believe this !
She must've gone down a hundred places !
What is she so obsessed with, sitting at her desk there ?
Oh, good evening.
Welcome back.
Oh, excuse me.
Just what kind of high school are you planning to attend with those scores ?
!
Fine !
I won't go to high school then !
You're not going...?
!
Don't think life is going to be that easy !
What will you do with only a junior high education ?
!
I'll decide for myself what I want to do !
Don't you talk back to me !
You're refusing to face reality !
Don't you know that your rank after second semester goes on your record ?
Oh, and is studying all that great ?
!
Now that you're in college, all you're doing are part-time jobs, Sis !
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do !
You're the one who's running away from what you're supposed to do !
Can't you see that ?
!
I'm not running away !
I just have something more important to do !
What's this important thing ?
Come on and show me !
Shiho, Shizuku, stop arguing.
But, Father !
Shizuku won't listen to me !
Well, both of you come here.
Let me hear your reasons.
Shizuku, you should change out of those clothes.
Hurry up.
I see.
Shizuku, is what Shiho says true ?
It's not like I don't care about my tests !
But you just said you weren't going to attend high school.
That's because you said I can't get into any high school !
Shiho, I want to talk to Shizuku alone.
Will you please wait outside ?
Yes.
Where's your mother ?
At the Tanaka's.
I'm home.
Welcome back, Mother.
Is your Father back ?
Will you come in here, too dear ?
Shiho has been telling me about Shizuku.
Yes, dear.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now
More important than your studies ?
Will you tell us what it is you're doing ?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Shizuku is this something you have to do now ?
But there's no time !
I only have three more weeks to do it !
I've decided to test myself during this time !
I have to do it !
Test yourself on what ?
What are you testing ?
We won't know if you don't tell us.
You can't even tell your father or your mother ?
Dear.
Oh, sorry.
Habit.
I've noticed that you're putting a lot of effort
Into something at the library.
I can respect that.
Should we let Shizuku do what she wants
Dear ?
It's not as if there's only one way to live your life.
Well, I've had times like this in my life, too.
All right
Shizuku.
You'll have to do as you believe.
But
It'll be very tough to find your own way.
If anything happens, you'll have no one to blame.
And please be present when we're eating dinner.
That's right.
You're part of the family.
Yes.
Go call Shiho in here.
I'll make some tea.
Fine.
Shizuku.
Father just said "Oh well"
But I think he really wanted you to study more.
I know that !
I could see it written on his face !
I'm going to be
Moving out this coming Sunday.
You'll have the room to yourself.
You're moving out, Sis ?
Yup.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry !
Hurry !
Hurry !
Only one of them is real !
Which one ?
Which one's the real one ?
Hurry !
Hurry !
Hurry !
Louise you've come for me.
Shizuku !
Please, come in.
Oh, I must've fallen asleep.
Please excuse me, but...
I've brought you my manuscript.
Does that mean you're finished ?
As I promised.
Please be the first one to read this.
This is pretty long !
Um, will you read it right now ?
I'll wait however long it takes.
But, after putting so much work into this
I wanted to take time to read it carefully.
If you don't like it, just stop reading it !
I mean, if this isn't a bother.
I, um...
I'm so nervous right now.
I understand.
I'll read it right away.
Come, let's sit by the fire.
It'll be cold today.
Now no one will bother us.
Um, is it okay if I wait downstairs ?
Hm ?
I'll be fine.
I'm not cold at all.
I don't mind, but...
So there you are.
Shizuku, I've finished reading it.
Thank you.
It was great !
That's not true !
That's not true !
Tell me the truth, please !
I couldn't even organize the story !
The second half is all messed up !
I realize it myself !
That's true.
It's a bit rough, unpolished, and incomplete.
Just like Seiji's violins !
You've shown me the very first jewel you've crafted.
I know you tried hard.
You did great.
There's no reason to hurry.
Take your time and polish it up.
Come on, it's cold out here.
Let's go in.
I...
I found out after I wrote the whole thing !
Just wanting to write isn't enough !
I need to study more !
But...
Seiji is going so much faster than I am !
I forced myself to write it, but I was so scared !
I was so scared !
You really like Seiji, don't you ?
How does it taste ?
It tastes great.
I had noodles with Seiji, too.
The first time he made a violin.
That was a jumbo serving too.
Ah, thank you.
Well, how far did we get before ?
You were a transfer student in Germany and you found the Baron at a cafe.
Right, right.
It's sort of melancholy
But I was attracted by his expression.
I pleaded with the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't do it.
He said, "This feline Baron has a companion."
"You can't separate two lovers like that."
The Baron is awaiting the return of his Baroness
Who was sent out for repairs.
But that's just like my story.
That's right !
What a coincidence, huh ?
It was almost the day I had to go home So I thought I had to give up.
But then, my girlfriend spoke up.
She said that when the Baron's companion returned she would make sure that the two figurines stayed together.
The proprietor finally gave in.
I only took the Baron with me when I moved
And left the other behind.
I told my girlfriend to hold onto the figurine for me
Until I came back for her.
I told her that the two figurines would meet when the two of us meet again.
But the war started right after that.
And I couldn't keep my promise.
When I finally went back to that town, I searched all over.
But in the end I couldn't find
Either her or the Baron's love.
She was very important to you, wasn't she ?
The Baron was really just a sad part of my past but you've brought him alive in a story of hope.
Oh, that's right.
Now, hold out your hands.
This stone is more appropriate for you.
I'm giving it to you.
Please work hard and create your own story.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye !
I'm back.
Where's Father ?
Taking a bath.
What time do you think it is right now ?
I'm sorry I've worried you.
As of now, I'm going back to being a regular student.
You don't have to worry anymore.
So you're done testing yourself ?
Just for now
Have you eaten ?
There's curry.
No, thanks.
Just for now, huh ?
I'm coming in, Shizuku.
Go take your bath.
Sleeping like a soldier.
Well, then...
It can't be !
W...wait a minute !
It's a miracle !
I got to see you !
This isn't a dream, right ?
My flight was a day early.
Get on !
Oh, wait.
You'll be cold like that.
C'mon, get on.
I'll go get my coat.
There isn't time !
Just get on.
Hold on tight now.
I really wanted to see you, Shizuku.
I don't know how long l thought, "Shizuku !"
And then, you really did poke your head out !
We're really amazing !
I wanted to see you, too.
It still feels like a dream !
How was Cremona ?
It's very different from what I'd heard, but I'll still do it.
Wow, it's getting really light.
Getting cold?
Should I get off ?
It's okay.
I decided...
I wanted to take this hill
With you on the bike !
That's not fair at all !
I don't want to be just a piece of luggage !
I want to be doing something, too !
All right !
Please help.
Just a little farther.
Shizuku !
Hurry and get on !
'Kay.
We're in time !
Need a hand ?
I'm fine.
This way.
Incredible !
The morning mist looks almost like the ocean !
This is my own secret place.
It's almost time.
This is what I wanted you to see.
Grandpa told me what you've been doing.
I didn't do anything to help you.
I was only thinking of myself.
No.
I was doing it because of you !
I'm glad I got to challenge myself.
I learned a little more about myself.
I'm going to study harder.
I've decided that I'm going to high school, too.
Shizuku, listen...
I, uh...of course I don't mean right now, but...
Will you marry me ?
!
I know I'll become a master violin maker !
And then, we can...
Yes.
You mean it ?
!
I'm so glad !
I've been hoping for the same thing !
Really !
Alright !
Hold it.
The wind's pretty cold.
Shizuku, I love you !

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
Pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You smoke too much.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Seiji Amasawa
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Seiji Amasawa
He's taken all these books out before me.
Seiji Amasawa...what's he like?
Wonder if he's nice.
Seiji Amasawa
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Clumsy!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Keep it up!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
20?
You've got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated Amasawa's Collection
'Amasawa' ...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...alright, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill... '...a road winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits for me to come home...
'Country road leading far away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
'Concrete roads, everywhere...
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concrete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No...are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Shizuku Tsukishima'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat...are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face...if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure...but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Shizuku Tsukishima!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks...but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concrete roads, everywhere' ...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Koichi Amasawa...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Excuse us!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
'Country road, this old road...
'If I go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong...'
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone...maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium;
Shiro Nishi, Prop.
'Shiro Nishi' ...maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, ' Why you, of all people, ' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I'm the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you...again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, okay?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dream of living on my own... '...with no fear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '...and pretended I was strong as I could be.
'Country road, this old road...
'If you go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye...
'If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to... '...push away memories...
'Country road, this old road... '...could go right to my home town...
'I won't go there, I can't go there... '...can't go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I'll be like I always am...
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...
'Fare thee well... '...country road.'
That was fun!
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Seiji Amasawa?
Yeah...didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi' outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Seiji Amasawa...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah...you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird...who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's okay.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's alright.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There's lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta' ...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
Go!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's okay.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
Luisa, my betrothed, and I were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's okay.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way...is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku...that's enough.
But Dad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh...sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa...you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
I promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart'
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's okay.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course...but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes...it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, don't you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes...quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
And I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
'For now' ...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait...you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too...it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's alright.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
Okay!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- I'm fine.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No...you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait...it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!
- Good evening.
- Oh, hi shizuku.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
Pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You smoke too much.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Seiji Amasawa
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Seiji Amasawa
He's taken all these books out before me.
Seiji Amasawa...what's he like?
Wonder if he's nice.
Seiji Amasawa
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Clumsy!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Keep it up!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
20?
You've got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated Amasawa's Collection
'Amasawa' ...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...alright, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill... '...a road winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits for me to come home...
'Country road leading far away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
'Concrete roads, everywhere...
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concrete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No...are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Shizuku Tsukishima'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat...are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face...if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure...but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Shizuku Tsukishima!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks...but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concrete roads, everywhere' ...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Koichi Amasawa...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Excuse us!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
'Country road, this old road...
'If I go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong...'
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone...maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium;
Shiro Nishi, Prop.
'Shiro Nishi' ...maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, ' Why you, of all people, ' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I'm the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you...again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, okay?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dream of living on my own... '...with no fear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '...and pretended I was strong as I could be.
'Country road, this old road...
'If you go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye...
'If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to... '...push away memories...
'Country road, this old road... '...could go right to my home town...
'I won't go there, I can't go there... '...can't go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I'll be like I always am...
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...
'Fare thee well... '...country road.'
That was fun!
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Seiji Amasawa?
Yeah...didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi' outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Seiji Amasawa...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah...you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird...who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's okay.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's alright.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There's lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta' ...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
Go!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's okay.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
Luisa, my betrothed, and I were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's okay.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way...is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku...that's enough.
But Dad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh...sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa...you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
I promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart'
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's okay.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course...but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes...it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, don't you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes...quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
And I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
'For now' ...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait...you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too...it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's alright.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
Okay!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- I'm fine.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No...you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait...it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!
Good evening.
Sure is hot, huh ?
I'm back.
Thanks.
Another plastic bag ?
It's just a carton of milk.
But they just give it to you.
You don't have to take it.
Oh, I'd like some, please.
And you, Father ?
Some wheat tea ?
Sure.
I'll have some.
Be right there.
Thanks.
Can I use it ?
I'm printing right now.
Maybe we should buy a portable word processor after all.
This smoke stinks.
You should have gone to Kashirazaki, too, Shizuku.
It's okay, I can't keep up with Sis.
Oh yeah
I've gotta go to work tomorrow.
You need a lunch ?
Don't worry, I'll eat out.
Our library's finally changing to a bar code system.
So things are really busy.
Then you are changing it.
I liked the card catalogs better.
Yeah, I do too.
Hey
Something's wrong with this composition.
What?
Where ?
Look, here
This name...
Shizuku, books are fine, but you should go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night.
I thought I remembered seeing this name...
And here, too.
This guy's amazing.
He borrowed all of them before I did.
Amasawa Seiji...
What kind of person is he ?
I wonder if he's cool or not ?
Shizuku, will you get up ?
I'm going out now !
Oh, geez.
You just slept that way?
Get the rice ready !
Have a good day.
What ?
!
It's that late ?
!
I have to meet Yuuko !
My wallet !
What ?
Did you forget it again ?
Yeah !
That's strange.
Is it next to the phone ?
Here it is !
You're the one who put it there.
Oh, I'm gonna be late !
Remember to lock up !
What a ditz.
Boy, are they flying low !
Something great's gonna happen today !
Wow, it's hot.
Yoo-hoo !
How's it goin' ?
C'mon, let's do it !
Hey, Shizuku !
Hey !
Go for it !
Miss Kousaka, are you in ?
Oh, it's you, Tsukishima.
What's up ?
Can I please ask a favor ?
What kind ?
I hope it's nothing strange.
Can you open the library, please ?
The library ?
Can't you wait until they open normally ?
But I've already read all my books.
And the county library's closed today.
I've decided to read twenty books during vacation.
Twenty books?
But you're supposed to be studying for your exams.
C'mon, hurry it up.
Let's see...
Got it !
Hurry and bring it over !
C'mon, c'mon.
Get out your reading card and your library card.
Here you go.
Hey, look at this.
No one's ever checked this out.
This is a rare book.
They don't have it at the county library.
Amasawa...
Teach !
Any idea what this "Amasawa" person is like ?
Geez, now I messed up.
Probably the donor of the book.
I wouldn't know about something that old.
Try asking our veteran teachers.
Shizuku !
Oh, geez !
So this is where you are !
After you said you'd be at the entrance at eleven !
You made me wait in the sun for fifteen minutes !
Now I'll get even more freckles !
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey !
Not so loud.
You worry too much about your freckles, Harada.
Teach this is a serious problem for me !
Oh, right !
Right !
Out, out !
That way, that way !
I did what I could but it's not that great.
Think I should have kept it in English ?
"Over the green hills, white clouds drift so slow."
"Near to the road that goes up to the city.'
"lnside the old room by the small window."
"The old dog waits for him to come back soon.'
"Country Road, take me home, too."
"On this distant road, whose end I can't see."
"West Virginia, Mountain Mamma."
"To my home town, I long to see."
This isn't bad.
It sucks!
Too conventional.
You think so ?
I did this one, too.
"Concrete road, wherever you go."
"Forests give rise to valleys far away."
"'Western Tokyo, on Mount Tama."
"My home lies on Concrete Road."
What is this ?
So, what'd you want to talk about ?
You don't need any poems translated, right ?
Shizuku, is there anyone you like ?
I just wish it was a mutual attraction.
It's exam time, and we could work together and cheer each other up.
So there's someone you like, Yuuko ?
You already got a love letter ?
!
Not so loud !
When ?
How is he ?
~~ls he cute ?
He's from a different class...
And he's kind of cute...
Why don't you go out with him ?
You can stop if you don't like him.
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like ?
!
There's no use hiding it !
C'mon !
Might as well 'fess up !
Umm...
it's Su...
Su...
TSUKISHIMA !
Can you get my bag for me ?
!
Sugimura !
Yeah !
Just throw it here !
Oh, shut up !
You don't even play that well !
That's mean !
I won three games as a regular !
Yuuko ?
So Sugimura's the one that you like, huh ?
What should I do ?
He might have found out.
I was so...
Oh, don't worry.
He's too stupid to know.
What'll you do about the love letters you got ?
I have to think a little longer.
I see.
You're lucky.
They don't keep telling you to "Study, study !" at your house.
It's kind of rough when they don't do that, too.
I don't know.
Oops.
Oh, no !
What's the matter ?
I forgot my book !
I have to go back !
Nope !
You'll be late for your cram session !
I'll call you later.
Sure !
T...that book is...
Oh.
Is this yours ?
Here you go...
Tsukishima Shizuku.
How'd you know my name ?
Gee, I wonder how ?
My library card.
You know you should drop that "Concrete Road" thing.
YOU READ IT !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
THAT JERK !
"You should drop that Concrete Road thing..."
I'm back !
Sis, you were due back today ?
I'm beat.
I was lucky to find someone driving this way and got a ride.
Where's Mom ?
She's still at her summer class.
And Dad's at work.
Shizuku, you should clean up a little.
Did you make supper yet ?
I was just going to...
What is this ?
!
Shizuku, this place is a mess !
I'll go do it now.
Didn't we decide to help Mom because she's so busy ?
Put away the laundry when you're done with the rice.
And I'll make dinner after I shower.
Grandma says
To come on over when you're in high school.
Doing better with your studies ?
If you slack off just cause Mom and Dad don't push you you'll really pay for it.
I know !
Shizuku, will you get up already ?
And do your own vacuuming.
I'm cleaning bedsheets, so bring yours !
And put out the futons !
Where's Mom ?
She's already gone.
Hurry and clean up then take this lunch to Dad.
What ?
!
What's your problem ?
You're going to the library, right ?
Or should I go instead ?
If so, then you clean the bathtub, the toilet
And the front entrance.
And start doing some real chores.
Then put away the futons, go shopping, and make dinner.
I'll be going !
Shizuku !
Take this to the mailbox !
What ?
The MAIL
BOX...ah
Don't you dare look !
Don't forget to take off the clip !
Your boyfriend ?
Dummy.
Hey, Kitty Cat.
On your own ?
Where are you going ?
Something neat outside ?
Hey !
Answer me, will you ?
I'm getting off here.
How 'bout you ?
See ya, Kitty Cat.
He's heading towards the library !
Darn, this would've made such a great story.
There he is !
What a steep hill !
Just how far does this go ?
Kitty Cat.
Kitty Cat.
I wonder if he lives around here ?
Where're you going, Kitty Cat ?
Do you live around here ?
I had no idea there was a place like this up here.
What a mean cat His walks include teasing the dog.
I wonder if he's teasing me, too ?
I had no idea there were stores like this here.
What a wonderful figurine.
Are you the cat I saw earlier ?
Oh, welcome !
I, umm...
No, stay right there, stay right there.
Feel free to look around.
The Baron's bored, too.
Is "Baron" the name of this figurine ?
Yup.
He's Baron Vunbert von Jiekingen.
Great name, don't you think ?
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
Magnificent clock, isn't it ?
It was found in a castle.
It was very badly rusted.
Take a look.
How pretty.
What is it ?
You'll find out when it's done.
It's really well made.
Are those dwarves ?
You sure know a lot.
I see, so you know about dwarves, young lady ?
Now take a look at the numbers.
Let's see if this works.
An elf !
Can you see alright ?
Step up here.
A princess ?
That's right.
These two fell in love ?
Yup, but they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarves.
When the clock strikes twelve
She must return past the flock to her world.
Even so
He will always appear at that time
And wait for the princess.
The artisan who made this clock probably
Had an unrequited love.
So that's why the two seemed sort of sad.
Is this clock running fast ?
Uh, maybe by five minutes.
Oh, no !
I gotta get to the library !
Goodbye !
Can I come visit again, sir ?
If you're going to the library you should go left !
I'm right above the library !
I've found a cool place !
This store's like right out of a story !
This is great !
Tsukishima !
Tsukishima Shizuku !
This is yours, right ?
Kinda forgetful, aren't you ?
Thank you.
But how...?
Gee, I wonder how ?
The cat !
ls...is that cat yours ?
You sure eat a pretty big lunch !
WRONG !
YOU'RE WRONG !
HEY !
Oh, you're here already ?
What's with the scary face ?
It's kinda hard to explain.
Huh ?
Something wonderful happened
Like finding a cave of treasures.
Then one insensitive remark made it all collapse.
Sounds complicated.
Here to borrow books again today ?
Yeah, I still have to read seven more books.
You just never change.
What about lunch ?
I'll just eat out.
Oh, really.
Well, thanks.
June 16th...
Amazing...
That Amasawa guy's read this book, too.
What kind of person is he ?
No, it couldn't be you !
Shizuku, hurry up !
Oh, we'll be late !
Umbrella.
The umbrella.
A new semester, and it just keeps raining.
Stop complaining.
You're studying because you want to, right?
Make sure you study well !
Just leave it to me.
Shizuku !
Hey !
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I hate all these tests.
We've got so many every day.
Did you answer "them ?" No.
He didn't write any more ?
No.
Maybe I should just turn him down.
Maybe Yeah, maybe that's for the best.
Sugimura !
Tsukishima Shizuku
I know that !
Time's up !
Hand in your tests.
Regular schedule this afternoon.
Shizuku, let's go see Miss Kousaka.
Can we go to the teacher's lounge first?
Okay.
Hey, Tsukishima.
Check this out.
What is it ?
I was guessing, but I aced it !
Oh, such a lucky guy.
I peeked during break and saw I got a perfect score.
Guess you're not just a stupid baseball player.
You know Yuuko's good at guessing, too.
Maybe you should study together ?
With Harada ?
Sugimura, Sugimura !
What's up ?
Did you see this ?
Let's go, Shizuku.
Stop trying to get us together !
Was it obvious ?
I was never good at guessing !
Sorry !
Excuse us.
The donor of a book ?
And you think I would know ?
Sorry to bother you during lunch.
It's this imprint here.
Let's see...
Oh, that's Amasawa !
I've read this, too.
Great book, isn't it ?
Yes, definitely.
So exactly what kind of person is this Amasawa ?
It was a few years ago.
He was the head of the PTA.
The PTA's...
Um, do you know his first name ?
First name ?
Let's see...
Mr. Kimura remember what Amasawa's name was ?
You know, at Amasawa Hospital ?
Amasawa ?
I'm pretty sure it was Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi...
Tsukishima...
one of Amasawa's children
In the same grade as you Didn't you know that ?
Wha...?
!
I, uh...
Thank you very much !
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry about that.
Shizuku, where're you going !
?
What a surprise !
I'm the one who should be surprised !
I think you owe me an explanation for this.
Oh, sorry.
Which way are you going, Shizuku ?
What nerve !
Acting like he didn't even see me !
Who was that, Shizuku ?
Where're you going ?
That guy's a jerk !
But I won't run from him, either !
Oh, how cute !
Tsukishima noticed boys, huh ?
Hey, Teach, I think spring has finally arrived for Shizuku, too !
I told you that isn't it !
You actually met the Prince of Books, then, right ?
Is he handsome ?
Look, I just wondered what kind of person he is.
Hey, Yuuko.
You know the guy's name, right ?
So tell us.
Yuuko !
Well, it was just a brief mention.
I think it started with "Ma" something, or Masagi whatever ?
"Ama..."
That's just like Tsukishima to leave
Without hearing the whole story.
She wants to know but she doesn't want to know, right ?
The hopeful heart suffers so ... Isn't it great ?
Well, it's romantic, anyway.
Fine, just go on and tease me like that.
And after I wrote the verses for Country Road and all.
You finished ?
Let's see !
~~Let's see !
Great Shizuku !
Mistress of verse !
We promise to behave, so please show us !
Very well.
Actually, I'm not too confident.
I'm still not too sure what "country home" means.
So I just had to go with what I felt on that.
You outdid yourself.
"Country road." "lt'll take me, back to my home town."
"l can feel it now, if I just keep to..."
"...this far-off way, country road."
It's great, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not too hard to sing ?
I think we can manage.
It'd be wasted if we gave it to the underclassmen.
We should sing this at the thank you party, too.
What ?
The thank you party ?
lmpulsive, aren't you ?
This part's good.
"Living here all on my own."
"Owning no possessions, I made my way out of town."
"l must put my loneliness away...and protect myself, I'll learn to be strong"
All of you, school bell's ringing.
Yes, ma'am !
The sky's clear !
It's clear !
Shizuku !
You wanna go to the choir?
We'll show them this song.
It's okay, I have to go to the library.
Huh ?
We've got tests tomorrow, you know.
I'll study at the library.
You really like it there !
See ya !
Bye-bye !
Harada...
Listen, I'm sorry, but can I talk to you ?
Have the flowers been watered ?
The Baron's gone !
I wonder if he was sold ?
Atelier Chikyuu-ya Nishi Shirou I wonder if he's named Nishi, too ?
Shizuku !
Shizuku !
You've got a call from Yuuko !
You'll ruin your ears, Shizuku.
Yuuko ?
I can't hear you.
Right.
I'll be right there.
Right.
Okay, bye.
Where're you going ?
Not too far.
What's wrong, Yuuko ?
Shizuku...
What's wrong ?
What's with that look ?
What should I do, Shizuku ?
Sugimura's friend asked him
To get an answer from me.
Oh, boy...
Why do you have to be the go-between ?
!
Hey !
He's just kinda stupid.
And besides, Sugimura probably doesn't know how you really feel.
I'll apologize to Sugimura.
But I can't go to school looking like this.
I'm skipping school tomorrow.
The test, too ?
Yes.
I think I did pretty well.
Shizuku, library again today ?
I'm going to Yuuko's place to see her.
Oh, say hi to her for us.
Okay.
Bye-bye !
Bye-bye !
Tsukishima !
Hold up !
Look, it's about Harada and then she suddenly started to cry.
So did I say something wrong or what ?
Sugimura didn't Yuuko ask you why you did that ?
Yeah.
Like I said, my friend on the team asked me...
Wrong!
She meant she really didn't want you to do that.
You understand what that means ?
I don't !
Spell it out for me !
Geez, you really are stupid !
It means Yuuko's in love with you !
Huh ?
!
But, then...
Man, that's a problem.
A problem...!
Poor Yuuko's the one with the problem !
She stayed home because of the shock !
B...but, I...
I'm in love with you !
O...oh, no.
You shouldn't joke around like that !
I'm not joking !
I've been in love with you for a long time !
You can't !
I mean...
I...well...but...
Do you hate me ?
Are you going out with someone ?
I'm not going out with anybody...
B...but...
I'm sorry !
Wait !
Tsukishima, you have to tell me !
We've always been friends so I do like you, Sugimura.
But when you mean in that way...
I'm sorry.
I can't say this right...
You mean we're just friends?
Even after this ?
Dummy !
The only stupid one was yourself !
Just a minute, Tsukishima.
You got a package.
Oh, thanks so much again.
You're so nice, always giving us stuff.
Oh, don't worry, we can't eat it all anyway.
Oh, you're home ?
Shizuku ?
Yoo-hoo.
Did you get locked out, too ?
Is this house your home ?
Are you hungry ?
Well, you're not cute, either.
Just like me.
Why did I have to change ?
I used to be such a nice and honest kid before.
Even when I'm reading a book
I don't feel the excitement I used to.
Now it's like someone whispering in my heart saying that I can't go on like this.
I'm not cute at all.
Hey, it's Tsukishima.
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.
Hey, Moon, aren't you here to visit ?
Is the cat's name Moon ?
Doesn't he look like a full moon ?
That's why I call him Moon.
You mean Moon isn't your cat ?
You can't tell cats what to do.
I think he's called "Egg" at another house.
He probably has other names.
So he's a stray, then.
That's right !
Moon commutes by taking the train.
The train ?
That's right.
He was riding the train by himself.
I followed him and came here.
And then here's this wonderful store.
It's like a fairy tale inside the store.
I said some bad things about him.
I told him he wasn't cute, and that he was just like me.
Moon is like you ?
You don't look alike at all !
T...that cat must be at least half ghost.
And you...
Is the store owner okay ?
I was wondering, since the store's been closed for a while.
Oh, he's just fine.
This store's kind of strange it's closed more often than not.
Oh, that's good to know.
I peeked through the window
But I couldn't see the Baron.
I thought he was sold.
Oh, the cat figurine ?
Wanna see ?
Come on.
Close the door
It's like we're floating up here.
Are you scared of heights ?
No, I like high places.
It's beautiful...
The view is nicest around this time.
Over here.
That's good.
Sit over there.
The clock's gone !
Oh, the one that was there ?
It was delivered today.
Come over here.
Did it get sold ?
It was only here for repairs.
I see.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
It was finished the day you left your lunch here.
Oh, that lunch...
Yeah, I know it wasn't yours.
Now come here and take a look at the cat's eye.
Hurry up.
The light's starting to fade.
"Engels Zimmer."
That's German for "Angel's Room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it when he was sewing up the clothes.
It's so pretty.
The Baron won't be sold.
It's Grandpa's treasure.
His treasure ?
It seems to hold some sort of memories for him.
Only he won't say what.
Look at it for as long as you want.
I'll be downstairs.
The light switch is over there.
Turn it on if you want.
Strange.
It's as if I've always known you.
I kept wanting to see you every once in a while.
You seem so very sad today.
Oh, are you done ?
Yeah, thanks.
Uh, are you making a violin ?
Y...yeah.
Can I see ?
Sure.
It'll look like this.
Did you make this all by hand ?
Of course.
I can't believe it !
They perfected the violin's design three hundred years ago.
The quality of its sound is determined by the skill of the maker.
Did you make all those, too ?
Course not !
We hold violin making classes here.
But you made one of them, didn't you ?
Yeah.
Which one is it ?
That one.
Wow !
This one ?
It's amazing that you could make this.
It's like magic.
Geez, you sure know how to embarrass a guy.
What's wrong with that ?
It's only what I think.
Anybody can make something like that.
I'm still not very good.
So, can you play the violin ?
Sort of.
Will you play for me ?
Just a little bit ?
Oh, c'mon !
Please !
Please !
Pretty please !
Fine, but you have to sing !
What ?
F...forget it !
I can't sing !
Sing.
I'm sure you know this song.
No one is with me.
Going fearlessly.
That's the way I live in the dream I saw.
I must put my loneliness away...and protect myself and I'll learn to be strong...
Country road, it'll take me...
back to my home town.
I can feel it now, if I just keep to ...this far-off way, country road.
It won't matter how lonely the times get You'll never see me cry
I'll keep my tears at bay.
I know I must take heart
And that hurrying is all I can do Only that way, can I forget
Country road, it may take me...
back to my home town, but even so.
Steeling my heart, I will not go now not while I'm free country road.
Country road, come tomorrow...
So it's goodbye...country road.
That was great !
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
Thank you so much for last time.
I was hoping to see you again, young lady.
These two are my musician friends.
So you're the lucky girl
Who was here when the clock was finished.
That's a cute friend you have there, Seiji.
Huh ?
Seiji ?
!
Does that mean your name is Amasawa Seiji ?
Yeah.
Oh, didn't I tell you my name ?
No, you didn't !
But the sign outside says Nishi !
That's my grandfather's name.
My name's Amasawa.
This is terrible !
What a shock !
My world's collapsing !
It's like the sky is falling !
What're you babbling about ?
It doesn't matter what my name is, does it ?
Yes, it does !
You're the one who didn't give your full name !
Well, it's your fault for not asking !
I never had a chance to ask you !
Oh, I was so sure Amasawa Seiji was...
What ?
I thought you'd be a nice, quiet guy !
Well, look at you !
You read too much !
Yeah ?
Well, you read a lot yourself !
That sure was fun.
Everybody was so nice.
You should visit again.
Grandpa and the others would love it.
Maybe only to listen.
Singing's too tough for me.
But you're really good with the violin.
Is that what you want to do ?
There're tons of people like me out there.
And besides, I want to make violins.
Really ?
But you play it so well...
There's a violin crafting school
In Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there after junior high.
You're not going to high school ?
My family's against it.
So I'm not sure yet what I'll do.
Grandpa is the only one supporting me on this.
It's great that you already know what you want to do.
Me, I still don't know what I want to do.
I'm just living life day by day.
Well, I haven't decided if I'll go yet.
I argue with my parents every day.
Even if I can go, I won't know
If I have any talent for it without trying first.
You sure you don't need a ride ?
Yeah.
It's just over there.
See you.
Oh, Tsukishima.
What is it ?
You know, you have a talent for lyrics.
And you sang pretty well earlier.
I like your Concrete Road a lot, too.
What?
After you told me I should drop it ?
Did I really say that ?
Yes, you did !
Really ?
Thanks for today.
Goodbye !
Shizuku, turn off the lamp.
You left it on last night.
Hey, Sis.
When did you decide on your career ?
What ?
Your career !
So you're applying at Sugino Miya ?
That's not what I said.
Well, that's what you go to college for.
Good night.
Good night.
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up just
Good morning.
Good morning.
You should run faster.
You can go ahead.
I'm saved...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
What a face !
It will recover so soon
Were you out walking with a guy from another class last night ?
What ?
!
Who's been saying that ?
!
Just a rumor.
They say you looked like a couple.
That's not how it was.
Harada, I should've refused to do my friend's favor.
I'm sorry.
No.
I should be the one to apologize.
It's okay.
This formula will be on the midterm !
So remember it well !
That's all !
Excuse me, is Tsukishima here ?
Oh, Amasawa.
What's up ?
Tsukishima's in this class, right ?
Tsukishima ?
Yeah, she's here.
Hey, Tsukishima !
Someone ta see you !
It's a guy !
See ?
There she is.
Seiji !
Tsukishima, got a minute ?
Y...yes !
Whoa !
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend !
That's not it at all !
Well ?
What is it ?
I've decided to go to Italy.
Huh ?
Let's go this way.
Where're we going ?
The roof !
How could you call me with so many people around ?
Sorry.
I just wanted you to be the first to know.
It...it's not like I care if people get the wrong idea...
My dad finally gave in But under certain conditions.
Huh ?
What ?
Grandpa's friend introduced me to someone there and I'll be his apprentice for 2 months.
Apprentice ?
He's a very strict person
And he'll see if I have the necessary talent.
And he said that if I do this, I'll know whether I can handle it.
If I can't do it, I have to go back to school.
Actually, I don't really like it.
It's almost like they want me to fail.
But it's a chance for me to go.
When...?
When will you be leaving ?
I have to get my passport.
My dad and I will be talking to the school today.
So you're leaving soon.
That's great !
You've got your wish !
Yeah.
Anyway, I'll just have to do my best.
The rain's stopped.
You're right.
Wow, look at that !
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.
Yeah.
I wonder what kind of place Cremona is.
Hopefully it's a nice town.
Yeah.
They say it's an old city.
And there are lots of people there who are violin makers.
That's so great.
You're already starting to fulfill your life's ambition.
I feel like such an idiot.
Thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to go to high school with Seiji ?"
But it's depressing to think how far behind you I am.
You know, I noticed you from the library cards
A long time ago.
I bet you never noticed how many times
I passed by you at the library.
I even sat right next to you once.
What ?
I had to read lots of books
Just so my name was on the card before yours.
When I go to Italy
I'll sing your song and work really hard.
I...
I will...
Don't push, you idiot !
HEY !
Watch it !
Tsukishima's pissed !
Here.
Shizuku, is that all you're going to eat ?
I'm supposed to meet Yuuko.
If you're going near the train station, buy some milk.
What ?
You're the one who drank it all, Shizuku !
She's been so lazy lately.
Sorry !
Were you waiting long ?
I'm so confused right now.
Good evening.
Welcome home.
Excuse us.
I'll make some tea.
Come get it when it's ready.
Okay !
I've been arguing with Father, so I'm not speaking to him.
Guys are so cool, though.
He said that he's coming back in two months
But if he graduates he's going right back for ten years.
That's almost like being apart forever !
But isn't there like a bond between the two of you ?
I think it's great !
But he's so much better than me.
Though we read the same books, that's all I did.
He already knows what he wants to do.
You really think so ?
That's right.
Wasn't Kinu in his class that first year ?
...but he's handsome and he's good at school.
So what if he is ?
You don't have to say it so bluntly.
Now I'm all depressed.
But why ?
You like him, so what's wrong ?
And he said he likes you, didn't he ?
But I just can't believe it.
Well, I don't get it.
If it was me, I'd write letters every day and expect letters every day to keep our spirits up.
How can I tell someone who's better than me to do his best ?
I don't know.
Listening to you
I don't know what you're looking for in a boyfriend.
Or are you thinking that
You can't find love until you've found a career ?
You have your talents too, Shizuku.
The underclassmen were all
Ecstatic over your translation of Country Road.
Unlike me
You can say what you feel.
"There're tons of people like me out there."
He said that he was going to test his ability.
So I have to try too.
I've decided.
I'm going to write a story.
If he's going to try, then I'll try too.
But midterms are almost here.
No problem.
Thanks, Yuuko.
I feel more confident now.
You're going home ?
Yep.
Thanks, I have to go.
Say hi to your mom for us.
You do your best, too Yuuko.
I'm sure Sugimura will notice your good points too.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Gee, that was pretty easy.
I'll just have to give it a try, too.
Muta !
Muta !
Mom, Muta's gone again !
Muta !
So it's Muta, huh ?
Oh, so the Baron's your main character ?
Can I use him, please ?
Seiji told me that you really treasure this figurine.
And that's why you're...?
Of course, go ahead.
But on one condition.
Yes ?
I want to be
The first person to read your story.
W...well, uh...
What do you think ?
Do I really have to show it to you ?
Besides, I still don't know if I can really write.
Well, that's just like us artisans.
You can't expect perfection when you're just starting.
Oh yes.
I have something nice I want you to see.
Here we go.
Take a look.
This kind of rock is called mica-slate.
Take a look inside that crack.
Right.
Like that.
It's beautiful !
That's called beryl.
It contains pieces of raw emeralds.
Emerald... the precious jewel ?
That's right.
Both you and Seiji are like that rock.
Like a natural, still unpolished stone.
I happen to like things like that.
But making violins
And writing stories are different.
You have to find the raw jewel inside
And spend the time to polish and refine it.
It's time-consuming work.
Can you see the big raw jewel inside that rock ?
Yes.
The truth is that if you polish and refine it
You'll find that it won't look very good.
The smaller ones deep inside are more pure.
In fact, there may be even better jewels inside
Where you can't see them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When you get old
You start rambling.
That's not good.
I'm scared to find out whether there's anything
This pretty inside myself.
But I still want to write
If I write it, you'll definitely be the first to read it.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.
A jewel...
Maybe a vein of lapis lazuli...
Let us go and find the deposit of lapis lazuli !
You have nothing to fear.
Space is distorted on the days of the New Moon.
That which is far will seem large.
And what is near will seem small.
But it only appears that way.
Now fly !
We'll catch an ascending wind !
The planetoids are gathering !
Excellent !
We're riding the wind !
At this rate, we shall soon pass that tower.
Are we that high up ?
Hardly.
Once we're closer it will not seem so at all.
Huh ?
It's unusual to see Shizuku look for something besides storybooks.
This person's making a violin in prison.
Seiji !
I thought you'd left already !
From what Grandpa said, I thought you might be here.
I'm glad I found you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
It's okay.
I'll wait here until you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
It's okay, I'm really happy you came to see me.
I can't see you off, but I'll wait for you to come back.
Sure.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry for complaining all the time.
I'll be doing my best, too.
Well, I'm off, then.
Have a safe trip !
My fiancee Louise and I are
From a town in a far-away foreign land.
And in that town, magic is still alive.
The craftsmen with magic in their blood made many things in their shops.
The one who created us was a poor apprentice in a figurine shop.
Nevertheless, Louise and I were very happy.
He created us to express his unrequited love.
However...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
Shizuku !
What's wrong ?
Tsukishima !
I...
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention !
This is important !
I'm sorry.
Harada, you read it instead.
What !
?
You were up 'til four again !
?
Don't worry.
I wasn't sleepy at all.
But, Shizuku
You've been blanking out a lot lately.
Like earlier.
I was just thinking.
There's so much to write, I don't know how to organize it.
I've lost my appetite.
Oh, you're here, Shizuku.
Look at this, you didn't even turn on the lights.
And I wish you would've put away the laundry.
Shizuku !
Come here for a second, Shizuku.
Where's Shizuku ?
ls she home ?
Said she didn't want any.
Oh, I've been expecting you.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way, please.
Is the Career Counseling Room open ?
Yeah.
This way.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're back early today, Shiho.
I'm exhausted.
Want some coffee ?
That sounds great.
Mother, I want to ask you something.
What is it ?
I've been thinking of moving out.
I've already found a place.
But won't that cost a lot ?
It's okay.
I've saved up some money from work.
I found a position at the cram school, so it'll be okay.
I see.
I've relied on you to do a lot of the housework, you know.
Good luck, then.
I'll tell your father.
Really ?
!
It'll be kinda tough until spring,
If I graduate, I'll be going to work, too.
When I do, I can help you out.
Sure.
I'd appreciate it.
I'm sorry to do it during such a bad time.
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate your helping with my data.
Shizuku will have more room and she'll be able to concentrate on studying.
She's been acting strange lately.
So you think so too ?
I was called to her school today.
Look at this.
What is it ?
I can't believe this !
She must've gone down a hundred places !
What is she so obsessed with, sitting at her desk there ?
Oh, good evening.
Welcome back.
Oh, excuse me.
Just what kind of high school are you planning to attend with those scores ?
!
Fine !
I won't go to high school then !
You're not going...?
!
Don't think life is going to be that easy !
What will you do with only a junior high education ?
!
I'll decide for myself what I want to do !
Don't you talk back to me !
You're refusing to face reality !
Don't you know that your rank after second semester goes on your record ?
Oh, and is studying all that great ?
!
Now that you're in college, all you're doing are part-time jobs, Sis !
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do !
You're the one who's running away from what you're supposed to do !
Can't you see that ?
!
I'm not running away !
I just have something more important to do !
What's this important thing ?
Come on and show me !
Shiho, Shizuku, stop arguing.
But, Father !
Shizuku won't listen to me !
Well, both of you come here.
Let me hear your reasons.
Shizuku, you should change out of those clothes.
Hurry up.
I see.
Shizuku, is what Shiho says true ?
It's not like I don't care about my tests !
But you just said you weren't going to attend high school.
That's because you said I can't get into any high school !
Shiho, I want to talk to Shizuku alone.
Will you please wait outside ?
Yes.
Where's your mother ?
At the Tanaka's.
I'm home.
Welcome back, Mother.
Is your Father back ?
Will you come in here, too dear ?
Shiho has been telling me about Shizuku.
Yes, dear.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now
More important than your studies ?
Will you tell us what it is you're doing ?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Shizuku is this something you have to do now ?
But there's no time !
I only have three more weeks to do it !
I've decided to test myself during this time !
I have to do it !
Test yourself on what ?
What are you testing ?
We won't know if you don't tell us.
You can't even tell your father or your mother ?
Dear.
Oh, sorry.
Habit.
I've noticed that you're putting a lot of effort
Into something at the library.
I can respect that.
Should we let Shizuku do what she wants
Dear ?
It's not as if there's only one way to live your life.
Well, I've had times like this in my life, too.
All right
Shizuku.
You'll have to do as you believe.
But
It'll be very tough to find your own way.
If anything happens, you'll have no one to blame.
And please be present when we're eating dinner.
That's right.
You're part of the family.
Yes.
Go call Shiho in here.
I'll make some tea.
Fine.
Shizuku.
Father just said "Oh well"
But I think he really wanted you to study more.
I know that !
I could see it written on his face !
I'm going to be
Moving out this coming Sunday.
You'll have the room to yourself.
You're moving out, Sis ?
Yup.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry !
Hurry !
Hurry !
Only one of them is real !
Which one ?
Which one's the real one ?
Hurry !
Hurry !
Hurry !
Louise you've come for me.
Shizuku !
Please, come in.
Oh, I must've fallen asleep.
Please excuse me, but...
I've brought you my manuscript.
Does that mean you're finished ?
As I promised.
Please be the first one to read this.
This is pretty long !
Um, will you read it right now ?
I'll wait however long it takes.
But, after putting so much work into this
I wanted to take time to read it carefully.
If you don't like it, just stop reading it !
I mean, if this isn't a bother.
I, um...
I'm so nervous right now.
I understand.
I'll read it right away.
Come, let's sit by the fire.
It'll be cold today.
Now no one will bother us.
Um, is it okay if I wait downstairs ?
Hm ?
I'll be fine.
I'm not cold at all.
I don't mind, but...
So there you are.
Shizuku, I've finished reading it.
Thank you.
It was great !
That's not true !
That's not true !
Tell me the truth, please !
I couldn't even organize the story !
The second half is all messed up !
I realize it myself !
That's true.
It's a bit rough, unpolished, and incomplete.
Just like Seiji's violins !
You've shown me the very first jewel you've crafted.
I know you tried hard.
You did great.
There's no reason to hurry.
Take your time and polish it up.
Come on, it's cold out here.
Let's go in.
I...
I found out after I wrote the whole thing !
Just wanting to write isn't enough !
I need to study more !
But...
Seiji is going so much faster than I am !
I forced myself to write it, but I was so scared !
I was so scared !
You really like Seiji, don't you ?
How does it taste ?
It tastes great.
I had noodles with Seiji, too.
The first time he made a violin.
That was a jumbo serving too.
Ah, thank you.
Well, how far did we get before ?
You were a transfer student in Germany and you found the Baron at a cafe.
Right, right.
It's sort of melancholy
But I was attracted by his expression.
I pleaded with the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't do it.
He said, "This feline Baron has a companion."
"You can't separate two lovers like that."
The Baron is awaiting the return of his Baroness
Who was sent out for repairs.
But that's just like my story.
That's right !
What a coincidence, huh ?
It was almost the day I had to go home So I thought I had to give up.
But then, my girlfriend spoke up.
She said that when the Baron's companion returned she would make sure that the two figurines stayed together.
The proprietor finally gave in.
I only took the Baron with me when I moved
And left the other behind.
I told my girlfriend to hold onto the figurine for me
Until I came back for her.
I told her that the two figurines would meet when the two of us meet again.
But the war started right after that.
And I couldn't keep my promise.
When I finally went back to that town, I searched all over.
But in the end I couldn't find
Either her or the Baron's love.
She was very important to you, wasn't she ?
The Baron was really just a sad part of my past but you've brought him alive in a story of hope.
Oh, that's right.
Now, hold out your hands.
This stone is more appropriate for you.
I'm giving it to you.
Please work hard and create your own story.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye !
I'm back.
Where's Father ?
Taking a bath.
What time do you think it is right now ?
I'm sorry I've worried you.
As of now, I'm going back to being a regular student.
You don't have to worry anymore.
So you're done testing yourself ?
Just for now
Have you eaten ?
There's curry.
No, thanks.
Just for now, huh ?
I'm coming in, Shizuku.
Go take your bath.
Sleeping like a soldier.
Well, then...
It can't be !
W...wait a minute !
It's a miracle !
I got to see you !
This isn't a dream, right ?
My flight was a day early.
Get on !
Oh, wait.
You'll be cold like that.
C'mon, get on.
I'll go get my coat.
There isn't time !
Just get on.
Hold on tight now.
I really wanted to see you, Shizuku.
I don't know how long I thought, "Shizuku !"
And then, you really did poke your head out !
We're really amazing !
I wanted to see you, too.
It still feels like a dream !
How was Cremona ?
It's very different from what I'd heard, but I'll still do it.
Wow, it's getting really light.
Getting cold?
Should I get off ?
It's okay.
I decided...
I wanted to take this hill
With you on the bike !
That's not fair at all !
I don't want to be just a piece of luggage !
I want to be doing something, too !
All right !
Please help.
Just a little farther.
Shizuku !
Hurry and get on !
'Kay.
We're in time !
Need a hand ?
I'm fine.
This way.
Incredible !
The morning mist looks almost like the ocean !
This is my own secret place.
It's almost time.
This is what I wanted you to see.
Grandpa told me what you've been doing.
I didn't do anything to help you.
I was only thinking of myself.
No.
I was doing it because of you !
I'm glad I got to challenge myself.
I learned a little more about myself.
I'm going to study harder.
I've decided that I'm going to high school, too.
Shizuku, listen...
I, uh...of course I don't mean right now, but...
Will you marry me ?
!
I know I'll become a master violin maker !
And then, we can...
Yes.
You mean it ?
!
I'm so glad !
I've been hoping for the same thing !
Really !
Alright !
Hold it.
The wind's pretty cold.
Shizuku, I love you !
Good evening.
Sure is hot, huh ?
I'm back.
Thanks.
Another plastic bag ?
It's just a carton of milk.
But they just give it to you.
You don't have to take it.
Oh, I'd like some, please.
And you, Father ?
Some wheat tea ?
Sure.
I'll have some.
Be right there.
Thanks.
Can I use it ?
I'm printing right now.
Maybe we should buy a portable word processor after all.
This smoke stinks.
You should have gone to Kashirazaki, too, Shizuku.
It's okay, I can't keep up with Sis.
Oh yeah
I've gotta go to work tomorrow.
You need a lunch ?
Don't worry, I'll eat out.
Our library's finally changing to a bar code system.
So things are really busy.
Then you are changing it.
I liked the card catalogs better.
Yeah, I do too.
Hey
Something's wrong with this composition.
What?
Where ?
Look, here
This name...
Shizuku, books are fine, but you should go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night.
I thought I remembered seeing this name...
And here, too.
This guy's amazing.
He borrowed all of them before I did.
Amasawa Seiji...
What kind of person is he ?
I wonder if he's cool or not ?
Shizuku, will you get up ?
I'm going out now !
Oh, geez.
You just slept that way?
Get the rice ready !
Have a good day.
What ?
!
It's that late ?
!
I have to meet Yuuko !
My wallet !
What ?
Did you forget it again ?
Yeah !
That's strange.
Is it next to the phone ?
Here it is !
You're the one who put it there.
Oh, I'm gonna be late !
Remember to lock up !
What a ditz.
Boy, are they flying low !
Something great's gonna happen today !
Wow, it's hot.
Yoo-hoo !
How's it goin' ?
C'mon, let's do it !
Hey, Shizuku !
Hey !
Go for it !
Miss Kousaka, are you in ?
Oh, it's you, Tsukishima.
What's up ?
Can I please ask a favor ?
What kind ?
I hope it's nothing strange.
Can you open the library, please ?
The library ?
Can't you wait until they open normally ?
But I've already read all my books.
And the county library's closed today.
I've decided to read twenty books during vacation.
Twenty books?
But you're supposed to be studying for your exams.
C'mon, hurry it up.
Let's see...
Got it !
Hurry and bring it over !
C'mon, c'mon.
Get out your reading card and your library card.
Here you go.
Hey, look at this.
No one's ever checked this out.
This is a rare book.
They don't have it at the county library.
Amasawa...
Teach !
Any idea what this "Amasawa" person is like ?
Geez, now I messed up.
Probably the donor of the book.
I wouldn't know about something that old.
Try asking our veteran teachers.
Shizuku !
Oh, geez !
So this is where you are !
After you said you'd be at the entrance at eleven !
You made me wait in the sun for fifteen minutes !
Now I'll get even more freckles !
I...
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey !
Not so loud.
You worry too much about your freckles, Harada.
Teach this is a serious problem for me !
Oh, right !
Right !
Out, out !
That way, that way !
I did what I could but it's not that great.
Think I should have kept it in English ?
"Over the green hills, white clouds drift so slow."
"Near to the road that goes up to the city.'
"lnside the old room by the small window."
"The old dog waits for him to come back soon.'
"Country Road, take me home, too."
"On this distant road, whose end I can't see."
"West Virginia, Mountain Mamma."
"To my home town, I long to see."
This isn't bad.
It sucks!
Too conventional.
You think so ?
I did this one, too.
"Concrete road, wherever you go."
"Forests give rise to valleys far away."
"'Western Tokyo, on Mount Tama."
"My home lies on Concrete Road."
What is this ?
So, what'd you want to talk about ?
You don't need any poems translated, right ?
Shizuku, is there anyone you like ?
I just wish it was a mutual attraction.
It's exam time, and we could work together and cheer each other up.
So there's someone you like, Yuuko ?
You already got a love letter ?
!
Not so loud !
When ?
How is he ?
~~Is he cute ?
He's from a different class...
And he's kind of cute...
Why don't you go out with him ?
You can stop if you don't like him.
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like ?
!
There's no use hiding it !
C'mon !
Might as well 'fess up !
Umm... it's Su...
Su...
TSUKlSHlMA !
Can you get my bag for me ?
!
Sugimura !
Yeah !
Just throw it here !
Oh, shut up !
You don't even play that well !
That's mean !
I won three games as a regular !
Yuuko ?
So Sugimura's the one that you like, huh ?
What should I do ?
He might have found out.
I was so...
Oh, don't worry.
He's too stupid to know.
What'll you do about the love letters you got ?
I have to think a little longer.
I see.
You're lucky.
They don't keep telling you to "Study, study !" at your house.
It's kind of rough when they don't do that, too.
I don't know.
Oops.
Oh, no !
What's the matter ?
I forgot my book !
I have to go back !
Nope !
You'll be late for your cram session !
I'll call you later.
Sure !
T...that book is...
Oh.
Is this yours ?
Here you go...
Tsukishima Shizuku.
How'd you know my name ?
Gee, I wonder how ?
My library card.
You know you should drop that "Concrete Road" thing.
YOU READ IT !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
That jerk !
THAT JERK !
"You should drop that Concrete Road thing..."
I'm back !
Sis, you were due back today ?
I'm beat.
I was lucky to find someone driving this way and got a ride.
Where's Mom ?
She's still at her summer class.
And Dad's at work.
Shizuku, you should clean up a little.
Did you make supper yet ?
I was just going to...
What is this ?
!
Shizuku, this place is a mess !
I'll go do it now.
Didn't we decide to help Mom because she's so busy ?
Put away the laundry when you're done with the rice.
And I'll make dinner after I shower.
Grandma says
To come on over when you're in high school.
Doing better with your studies ?
If you slack off just cause Mom and Dad don't push you you'll really pay for it.
I know !
Shizuku, will you get up already ?
And do your own vacuuming.
I'm cleaning bed sheets, so bring yours !
And put out the futons !
Where's Mom ?
She's already gone.
Hurry and clean up then take this lunch to Dad.
What ?
!
What's your problem ?
You're going to the library, right ?
Or should I go instead ?
If so, then you clean the bathtub, the toilet
And the front entrance.
And start doing some real chores.
Then put away the futons, go shopping, and make dinner.
I'll be going !
Shizuku !
Take this to the mailbox !
What ?
The MAIL
BOX...ah
Don't you dare look !
Don't forget to take off the clip !
Your boyfriend ?
Dummy.
Hey, Kitty Cat.
On your own ?
Where are you going ?
Something neat outside ?
Hey !
Answer me, will you ?
I'm getting off here.
How 'bout you ?
See ya, Kitty Cat.
He's heading towards the library !
Darn, this would've made such a great story.
There he is !
What a steep hill !
Just how far does this go ?
Kitty Cat.
Kitty Cat.
I wonder if he lives around here ?
Where're you going, Kitty Cat ?
Do you live around here ?
I had no idea there was a place like this up here.
What a mean cat His walks include teasing the dog.
I wonder if he's teasing me, too ?
I had no idea there were stores like this here.
What a wonderful figurine.
Are you the cat I saw earlier ?
Oh, welcome !
I, umm...
No, stay right there, stay right there.
Feel free to look around.
The Baron's bored, too.
Is "Baron" the name of this figurine ?
Yup.
He's Baron Vunbert von Jiekingen.
Great name, don't you think ?
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
Magnificent clock, isn't it ?
It was found in a castle.
It was very badly rusted.
Take a look.
How pretty.
What is it ?
You'll find out when it's done.
It's really well made.
Are those dwarves ?
You sure know a lot.
I see, so you know about dwarves, young lady ?
Now take a look at the numbers.
Let's see if this works.
An elf !
Can you see alright ?
Step up here.
A princess ?
That's right.
These two fell in love ?
Yup, but they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarves.
When the clock strikes twelve
She must return past the flock to her world.
Even so
He will always appear at that time
And wait for the princess.
The artisan who made this clock probably
Had an unrequited love.
So that's why the two seemed sort of sad.
Is this clock running fast ?
Uh, maybe by five minutes.
Oh, no !
I gotta get to the library !
Goodbye !
Can I come visit again, sir ?
If you're going to the library you should go left !
I'm right above the library !
I've found a cool place !
This store's like right out of a story !
This is great !
Tsukishima !
Tsukishima Shizuku !
This is yours, right ?
Kinda forgetful, aren't you ?
Thank you.
But how...?
Gee, I wonder how ?
The cat !
Is...is that cat yours ?
You sure eat a pretty big lunch !
WRONG !
YOU'RE WRONG !
HEY !
Oh, you're here already ?
What's with the scary face ?
It's kinda hard to explain.
Huh ?
Something wonderful happened
Like finding a cave of treasures.
Then one insensitive remark made it all collapse.
Sounds complicated.
Here to borrow books again today ?
Yeah, I still have to read seven more books.
You just never change.
What about lunch ?
I'll just eat out.
Oh, really.
Well, thanks.
June 16th...
Amazing...
That Amasawa guy's read this book, too.
What kind of person is he ?
No, it couldn't be you !
Shizuku, hurry up !
Oh, we'll be late !
Umbrella.
The umbrella.
A new semester, and it just keeps raining.
Stop complaining.
You're studying because you want to, right?
Make sure you study well !
Just leave it to me.
Shizuku !
Hey !
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I hate all these tests.
We've got so many every day.
Did you answer "them ?" No.
He didn't write any more ?
No.
Maybe I should just turn him down.
Maybe Yeah, maybe that's for the best.
Sugimura !
Tsukishima Shizuku
I know that !
Time's up !
Hand in your tests.
Regular schedule this afternoon.
Shizuku, let's go see Miss Kousaka.
Can we go to the teacher's lounge first?
Okay.
Hey, Tsukishima.
Check this out.
What is it ?
I was guessing, but I aced it !
Oh, such a lucky guy.
I peeked during break and saw I got a perfect score.
Guess you're not just a stupid baseball player.
You know Yuuko's good at guessing, too.
Maybe you should study together ?
With Harada ?
Sugimura, Sugimura !
What's up ?
Did you see this ?
Let's go, Shizuku.
Stop trying to get us together !
Was it obvious ?
I was never good at guessing !
Sorry !
Excuse us.
The donor of a book ?
And you think I would know ?
Sorry to bother you during lunch.
It's this imprint here.
Let's see...
Oh, that's Amasawa !
I've read this, too.
Great book, isn't it ?
Yes, definitely.
So exactly what kind of person is this Amasawa ?
It was a few years ago.
He was the head of the PTA.
The PTA's...
Um, do you know his first name ?
First name ?
Let's see...
Mr. Kimura remember what Amasawa's name was ?
You know, at Amasawa Hospital ?
Amasawa ?
I'm pretty sure it was Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi.
Amasawa Kouichi...
Tsukishima... one of Amasawa's children ln the same grade as you Didn't you know that ?
Wha...?
!
I, uh...
Thank you very much !
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry about that.
Shizuku, where're you going !
?
What a surprise !
I'm the one who should be surprised !
I think you owe me an explanation for this.
Oh, sorry.
Which way are you going, Shizuku ?
What nerve !
Acting like he didn't even see me !
Who was that, Shizuku ?
Where're you going ?
That guy's a jerk !
But I won't run from him, either !
Oh, how cute !
Tsukishima noticed boys, huh ?
Hey, Teach, I think spring has finally arrived for Shizuku, too !
I told you that isn't it !
You actually met the Prince of Books, then, right ?
Is he handsome ?
Look, I just wondered what kind of person he is.
Hey, Yuuko.
You know the guy's name, right ?
So tell us.
Yuuko !
Well, it was just a brief mention.
I think it started with "Ma" something, or Masagi whatever ?
"Ama..."
That's just like Tsukishima to leave
Without hearing the whole story.
She wants to know but she doesn't want to know, right ?
The hopeful heart suffers so ...
Isn't it great ?
Well, it's romantic, anyway.
Fine, just go on and tease me like that.
And after I wrote the verses for Country Road and all.
You finished ?
Let's see !
~~Let's see !
Great Shizuku !
Mistress of verse !
We promise to behave, so please show us !
Very well.
Actually, I'm not too confident.
I'm still not too sure what "country home" means.
So I just had to go with what I felt on that.
You outdid yourself.
"Country road." "It'll take me, back to my home town."
"I can feel it now, if I just keep to..."
"...this far-off way, country road."
It's great, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not too hard to sing ?
I think we can manage.
It'd be wasted if we gave it to the underclassmen.
We should sing this at the thank you party, too.
What ?
The thank you party ?
lmpulsive, aren't you ?
This part's good. "Living here all on my own."
"Owning no possessions, I made my way out of town."
"I must put my loneliness away...and protect myself, I'll learn to be strong"
All of you, school bell's ringing.
Yes, ma'am !
The sky's clear !
It's clear !
Shizuku !
You wanna go to the choir?
We'll show them this song.
It's okay, I have to go to the library.
Huh ?
We've got tests tomorrow, you know.
I'll study at the library.
You really like it there !
See ya !
Bye-bye !
Harada...
Listen, I'm sorry, but can I talk to you ?
Have the flowers been watered ?
The Baron's gone !
I wonder if he was sold ?
Atelier Chikyuu-ya Nishi Shirou I wonder if he's named Nishi, too ?
Shizuku !
Shizuku !
You've got a call from Yuuko !
You'll ruin your ears, Shizuku.
Yuuko ?
I can't hear you.
Right.
I'll be right there.
Right.
Okay, bye.
Where're you going ?
Not too far.
What's wrong, Yuuko ?
Shizuku...
What's wrong ?
What's with that look ?
What should I do, Shizuku ?
Sugimura's friend asked him
To get an answer from me.
Oh, boy...
Why do you have to be the go-between ?
!
Hey !
He's just kinda stupid.
And besides, Sugimura probably doesn't know how you really feel.
I'll apologize to Sugimura.
But I can't go to school looking like this.
I'm skipping school tomorrow.
The test, too ?
Yes.
I think I did pretty well.
Shizuku, library again today ?
I'm going to Yuuko's place to see her.
Oh, say hi to her for us.
Okay.
Bye-bye !
Bye-bye !
Tsukishima !
Hold up !
Look, it's about Harada and then she suddenly started to cry.
So did I say something wrong or what ?
Sugimura didn't Yuuko ask you why you did that ?
Yeah.
Like I said, my friend on the team asked me...
Wrong!
She meant she really didn't want you to do that.
You understand what that means ?
I don't !
Spell it out for me !
Geez, you really are stupid !
It means Yuuko's in love with you !
Huh ?
!
But, then...
Man, that's a problem.
A problem...!
Poor Yuuko's the one with the problem !
She stayed home because of the shock !
B...but, I...
I'm in love with you !
O...oh, no.
You shouldn't joke around like that !
I'm not joking !
I've been in love with you for a long time !
You can't !
I mean...
I...well...but...
Do you hate me ?
Are you going out with someone ?
I'm not going out with anybody...
B...but...
I'm sorry !
Wait !
Tsukishima, you have to tell me !
We've always been friends so I do like you, Sugimura.
But when you mean in that way...
I'm sorry.
I can't say this right...
You mean we're just friends?
Even after this ?
Dummy !
The only stupid one was yourself !
Just a minute, Tsukishima.
You got a package.
Oh, thanks so much again.
You're so nice, always giving us stuff.
Oh, don't worry, we can't eat it all anyway.
Oh, you're home ?
Shizuku ?
Yoo-hoo.
Did you get locked out, too ?
Is this house your home ?
Are you hungry ?
Well, you're not cute, either.
Just like me.
Why did I have to change ?
I used to be such a nice and honest kid before.
Even when I'm reading a book
I don't feel the excitement I used to.
Now it's like someone whispering in my heart saying that I can't go on like this.
I'm not cute at all.
Hey, it's Tsukishima.
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.
Hey, Moon, aren't you here to visit ?
Is the cat's name Moon ?
Doesn't he look like a full moon ?
That's why I call him Moon.
You mean Moon isn't your cat ?
You can't tell cats what to do.
I think he's called "Egg" at another house.
He probably has other names.
So he's a stray, then.
That's right !
Moon commutes by taking the train.
The train ?
That's right.
He was riding the train by himself.
I followed him and came here.
And then here's this wonderful store.
It's like a fairy tale inside the store.
I said some bad things about him.
I told him he wasn't cute, and that he was just like me.
Moon is like you ?
You don't look alike at all !
T...that cat must be at least half ghost.
And you...
Is the store owner okay ?
I was wondering, since the store's been closed for a while.
Oh, he's just fine.
This store's kind of strange it's closed more often than not.
Oh, that's good to know.
I peeked through the window
But I couldn't see the Baron.
I thought he was sold.
Oh, the cat figurine ?
Wanna see ?
Come on.
Close the door
It's like we're floating up here.
Are you scared of heights ?
No, I like high places.
It's beautiful...
The view is nicest around this time.
Over here.
That's good.
Sit over there.
The clock's gone !
Oh, the one that was there ?
It was delivered today.
Come over here.
Did it get sold ?
It was only here for repairs.
I see.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
It was finished the day you left your lunch here.
Oh, that lunch...
Yeah, I know it wasn't yours.
Now come here and take a look at the cat's eye.
Hurry up.
The light's starting to fade.
"Engels Zimmer."
That's German for "Angel's Room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it when he was sewing up the clothes.
It's so pretty.
The Baron won't be sold.
It's Grandpa's treasure.
His treasure ?
It seems to hold some sort of memories for him.
Only he won't say what.
Look at it for as long as you want.
I'll be downstairs.
The light switch is over there.
Turn it on if you want.
Strange.
It's as if I've always known you.
I kept wanting to see you every once in a while.
You seem so very sad today.
Oh, are you done ?
Yeah, thanks.
Uh, are you making a violin ?
Y...yeah.
Can I see ?
Sure.
It'll look like this.
Did you make this all by hand ?
Of course.
I can't believe it !
They perfected the violin's design three hundred years ago.
The quality of its sound is determined by the skill of the maker.
Did you make all those, too ?
Course not !
We hold violin making classes here.
But you made one of them, didn't you ?
Yeah.
Which one is it ?
That one.
Wow !
This one ?
It's amazing that you could make this.
It's like magic.
Geez, you sure know how to embarrass a guy.
What's wrong with that ?
It's only what I think.
Anybody can make something like that.
I'm still not very good.
So, can you play the violin ?
Sort of.
Will you play for me ?
Just a little bit ?
Oh, c'mon !
Please !
Please !
Pretty please !
Fine, but you have to sing !
What ?
F...forget it !
I can't sing !
I'm sure you know this song.
No one is with me.
Going fearlessly.
That's the way I live in the dream I saw.
I must put my loneliness away... and protect myself and I'll learn to be strong...
Country road, it'll take me... back to my home town.
I can feel it now, if I just keep to ... this far-off way, country road.
It won't matter how lonely the times get You'll never see me cry
I'll keep my tears at bay.
I know I must take heart
And that hurrying is all I can do Only that way, can I forget
Country road, it may take me...
back to my home town, but even so.
Steeling my heart, I will not go now not while I'm free country road.
Country road, come tomorrow...
So it's goodbye... country road.
That was great!
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
Thank you so much for last time.
I was hoping to see you again, young lady.
These two are my musician friends.
So you're the lucky girl
Who was here when the clock was finished.
That's a cute friend you have there, Seiji.
Huh?
Seiji?
!
Does that mean your name is Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah.
Oh, didn't I tell you my name?
No, you didn't!
But the sign outside says Nishi!
That's my grandfather's name.
My name's Amasawa.
This is terrible!
What a shock!
My world's collapsing!
It's like the sky is falling!
What're you babbling about?
It doesn't matter what my name is, does it?
Yes, it does!
You're the one who didn't give your full name!
Well, it's your fault for not asking!
I never had a chance to ask you!
Oh, I was so sure Amasawa Seiji was...
What?
I thought you'd be a nice, quiet guy!
Well, look at you!
You read too much!
Yeah?
Well, you read a lot yourself!
That sure was fun.
Everybody was so nice.
You should visit again.
Grandpa and the others would love it.
Maybe only to listen.
Singing's too tough for me.
But you're really good with the violin.
Is that what you want to do?
There're tons of people like me out there.
And besides, I want to make violins.
Really?
But you play it so well...
There's a violin crafting school
In Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there after junior high.
You're not going to high school?
My family's against it.
So I'm not sure yet what I'll do.
Grandpa is the only one supporting me on this.
It's great that you already know what you want to do.
Me, I still don't know what I want to do.
I'm just living life day by day.
Well, I haven't decided if I'll go yet.
I argue with my parents every day.
Even if I can go, I won't know
If I have any talent for it without trying first.
You sure you don't need a ride?
Yeah.
It's just over there.
See you.
Oh, Tsukishima.
What is it?
You know, you have a talent for lyrics.
And you sang pretty well earlier.
I like your Concrete Road a lot, too.
What?
After you told me I should drop it?
Did I really say that?
Yes, you did!
Really?
Thanks for today.
Goodbye!
Shizuku, turn off the lamp.
You left it on last night.
Hey, Sis.
When did you decide on your career?
What?
Your career!
So you're applying at Sugino Miya?
That's not what I said.
Well, that's what you go to college for.
Good night.
Good night.
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up just
Good morning.
Good morning.
You should run faster.
You can go ahead.
I'm saved...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
What a face!
It will recover so soon
Were you out walking with a guy from another class last night?
What?
!
Who's been saying that?
!
Just a rumor.
They say you looked like a couple.
That's not how it was.
Harada, I should've refused to do my friend's favor.
I'm sorry.
No.
I should be the one to apologize.
It's okay.
This formula will be on the midterm!
So remember it well!
That's all!
Excuse me, is Tsukishima here?
Oh, Amasawa.
What's up?
Tsukishima's in this class, right?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Hey, Tsukishima!
Someone ta see you!
It's a guy!
See?
There she is.
Seiji!
Tsukishima, got a minute?
Y... yes!
Whoa!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
That's not it at all!
Well?
What is it?
I've decided to go to Italy.
Huh?
Let's go this way.
Where're we going?
The roof!
How could you call me with so many people around?
Sorry.
I just wanted you to be the first to know.
It... it's not like I care if people get the wrong idea...
My dad finally gave in But under certain conditions.
Huh?
What?
Grandpa's friend introduced me to someone there and I'll be his apprentice for 2 months.
Apprentice?
He's a very strict person
And he'll see if I have the necessary talent.
And he said that if I do this, I'll know whether I can handle it.
If I can't do it, I have to go back to school.
Actually, I don't really like it.
It's almost like they want me to fail.
But it's a chance for me to go.
When...?
When will you be leaving?
I have to get my passport.
My dad and I will be talking to the school today.
So you're leaving soon.
That's great!
You've got your wish!
Yeah.
Anyway, I'll just have to do my best.
The rain's stopped.
You're right.
Wow, look at that!
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.
Yeah.
I wonder what kind of place Cremona is.
Hopefully it's a nice town.
Yeah.
They say it's an old city.
And there are lots of people there who are violin makers.
That's so great.
You're already starting to fulfill your life's ambition.
I feel like such an idiot.
Thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to go to high school with Seiji?"
But it's depressing to think how far behind you I am.
You know, I noticed you from the library cards
A long time ago.
I bet you never noticed how many times
I passed by you at the library.
I even sat right next to you once.
What?
I had to read lots of books
Just so my name was on the card before yours.
When I go to Italy
I'll sing your song and work really hard.
I...
I will...
Don't push, you idiot!
HEY!
Watch it!
Tsukishima's pissed!
Here.
Shizuku, is that all you're going to eat?
I'm supposed to meet Yuuko.
If you're going near the train station, buy some milk.
What?
You're the one who drank it all, Shizuku!
She's been so lazy lately.
Sorry!
Were you waiting long?
I'm so confused right now.
Good evening.
Welcome home.
Excuse us.
I'll make some tea.
Come get it when it's ready.
Okay!
I've been arguing with Father, so I'm not speaking to him.
Guys are so cool, though.
He said that he's coming back in two months
But if he graduates he's going right back for ten years.
That's almost like being apart forever!
But isn't there like a bond between the two of you?
I think it's great!
But he's so much better than me.
Though we read the same books, that's all I did.
He already knows what he wants to do.
You really think so?
That's right.
Wasn't Kinu in his class that first year?
...but he's handsome and he's good at school.
So what if he is?
You don't have to say it so bluntly.
Now I'm all depressed.
But why?
You like him, so what's wrong?
And he said he likes you, didn't he?
But I just can't believe it.
Well, I don't get it.
If it was me, I'd write letters every day and expect letters every day to keep our spirits up.
How can I tell someone who's better than me to do his best?
I don't know.
Listening to you
I don't know what you're looking for in a boyfriend.
Or are you thinking that
You can't find love until you've found a career?
You have your talents too, Shizuku.
The underclassmen were all
Ecstatic over your translation of Country Road.
Unlike me
You can say what you feel.
"There're tons of people like me out there. "
He said that he was going to test his ability.
So I have to try too.
I've decided.
I'm going to write a story.
If he's going to try, then I'll try too.
But midterms are almost here.
No problem.
Thanks, Yuuko.
I feel more confident now.
You're going home?
Yep.
Thanks, I have to go.
Say hi to your mom for us.
You do your best, too Yuuko.
I'm sure Sugimura will notice your good points too.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Gee, that was pretty easy.
I'll just have to give it a try, too.
Muta!
Muta!
Mom, Muta's gone again!
Muta!
So it's Muta, huh?
Oh, so the Baron's your main character?
Can I use him, please?
Seiji told me that you really treasure this figurine.
And that's why you're...?
Of course, go ahead.
But on one condition.
Yes?
I want to be
The first person to read your story.
W... well, uh...
What do you think?
Do I really have to show it to you?
Besides, I still don't know if I can really write.
Well, that's just like us artisans.
You can't expect perfection when you're just starting.
Oh yes.
I have something nice I want you to see.
Here we go.
Take a look.
This kind of rock is called mica-slate.
Take a look inside that crack.
Right.
Like that.
It's beautiful!
That's called beryl.
It contains pieces of raw emeralds.
Emerald... the precious jewel?
That's right.
Both you and Seiji are like that rock.
Like a natural, still unpolished stone.
I happen to like things like that.
But making violins
And writing stories are different.
You have to find the raw jewel inside
And spend the time to polish and refine it.
It's time-consuming work.
Can you see the big raw jewel inside that rock?
Yes.
The truth is that if you polish and refine it
You'll find that it won't look very good.
The smaller ones deep inside are more pure.
In fact, there may be even better jewels inside
Where you can't see them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When you get old
You start rambling.
That's not good.
I'm scared to find out whether there's anything
This pretty inside myself.
But I still want to write
If I write it, you'll definitely be the first to read it.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.
A jewel...
Maybe a vein of lapis lazuli...
Let us go and find the deposit of lapis lazuli!
You have nothing to fear.
Space is distorted on the days of the New Moon.
That which is far will seem large.
And what is near will seem small.
But it only appears that way.
Now fly!
We'll catch an ascending wind!
The planetoids are gathering!
Excellent!
We're riding the wind!
At this rate, we shall soon pass that tower.
Are we that high up?
Hardly.
Once we're closer it will not seem so at all.
Huh?
It's unusual to see Shizuku look for something besides storybooks.
This person's making a violin in prison.
Seiji!
I thought you'd left already!
From what Grandpa said, I thought you might be here.
I'm glad I found you.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
It's okay.
I'll wait here until you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
It's okay, I'm really happy you came to see me.
I can't see you off, but I'll wait for you to come back.
Sure.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry for complaining all the time.
I'll be doing my best, too.
Well, I'm off, then.
Have a safe trip!
My fiancee Louise and I are
From a town in a far-away foreign land.
And in that town, magic is still alive.
The craftsmen with magic in their blood made many things in their shops.
The one who created us was a poor apprentice in a figurine shop.
Nevertheless, Louise and I were very happy.
He created us to express his unrequited love.
However...
Shizuku.
Shizuku.
Shizuku!
What's wrong?
Tsukishima!
I...
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
I'm sorry.
Harada, you read it instead.
What!
?
You were up 'til four again!
?
Don't worry.
I wasn't sleepy at all.
But, Shizuku
You've been blanking out a lot lately.
Like earlier.
I was just thinking.
There's so much to write, I don't know how to organize it.
I've lost my appetite.
Oh, you're here, Shizuku.
Look at this, you didn't even turn on the lights.
And I wish you would've put away the laundry.
Shizuku!
Come here for a second, Shizuku.
Where's Shizuku?
Is she home?
Said she didn't want any.
Oh, I've been expecting you.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way, please.
Is the Career Counseling Room open?
Yeah.
This way.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're back early today, Shiho.
I'm exhausted.
Want some coffee?
That sounds great.
Mother, I want to ask you something.
What is it?
I've been thinking of moving out.
I've already found a place.
But won't that cost a lot?
It's okay.
I've saved up some money from work.
I found a position at the cram school, so it'll be okay.
I see.
I've relied on you to do a lot of the housework, you know.
Good luck, then.
I'll tell your father.
Really?
!
It'll be kinda tough until spring,
If I graduate, I'll be going to work, too.
When I do, I can help you out.
Sure.
I'd appreciate it.
I'm sorry to do it during such a bad time.
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate your helping with my data.
Shizuku will have more room and she'll be able to concentrate on studying.
She's been acting strange lately.
So you think so too?
I was called to her school today.
Look at this.
What is it?
I can't believe this!
She must've gone down a hundred places!
What is she so obsessed with, sitting at her desk there?
Oh, good evening.
Welcome back.
Oh, excuse me.
Just what kind of high school are you planning to attend with those scores?
!
Fine!
I won't go to high school then!
You're not going...?
!
Don't think life is going to be that easy!
What will you do with only a junior high education?
!
I'll decide for myself what I want to do!
Don't you talk back to me!
You're refusing to face reality!
Don't you know that your rank after second semester goes on your record?
Oh, and is studying all that great?
!
Now that you're in college, all you're doing are part-time jobs, Sis!
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do!
You're the one who's running away from what you're supposed to do!
Can't you see that?
!
I'm not running away!
I just have something more important to do!
What's this important thing?
Come on and show me!
Shiho, Shizuku, stop arguing.
But, Father!
Shizuku won't listen to me!
Well, both of you come here.
Let me hear your reasons.
Shizuku, you should change out of those clothes.
Hurry up.
I see.
Shizuku, is what Shiho says true?
It's not like I don't care about my tests!
But you just said you weren't going to attend high school.
That's because you said I can't get into any high school!
Shiho, I want to talk to Shizuku alone.
Will you please wait outside?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanaka's.
I'm home.
Welcome back, Mother.
Is your Father back?
Will you come in here, too dear?
Shiho has been telling me about Shizuku.
Yes, dear.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now
More important than your studies?
Will you tell us what it is you're doing?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Shizuku is this something you have to do now?
But there's no time!
I only have three more weeks to do it!
I've decided to test myself during this time!
I have to do it!
Test yourself on what?
What are you testing?
We won't know if you don't tell us.
You can't even tell your father or your mother?
Dear.
Oh, sorry.
Habit.
I've noticed that you're putting a lot of effort
Into something at the library.
I can respect that.
Should we let Shizuku do what she wants
Dear?
It's not as if there's only one way to live your life.
Well, I've had times like this in my life, too.
All right
Shizuku.
You'll have to do as you believe.
But
It'll be very tough to find your own way.
If anything happens, you'll have no one to blame.
And please be present when we're eating dinner.
That's right.
You're part of the family.
Yes.
Go call Shiho in here.
I'll make some tea.
Fine.
Shizuku.
Father just said "Oh well"
But I think he really wanted you to study more.
I know that!
I could see it written on his face!
I'm going to be
Moving out this coming Sunday.
You'll have the room to yourself.
You're moving out, Sis?
Yup.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one of them is real!
Which one?
Which one's the real one?
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Louise you've come for me.
Shizuku!
Please, come in.
Oh, I must've fallen asleep.
Please excuse me, but...
I've brought you my manuscript.
Does that mean you're finished?
As I promised.
Please be the first one to read this.
This is pretty long!
Um, will you read it right now?
I'll wait however long it takes.
But, after putting so much work into this
I wanted to take time to read it carefully.
If you don't like it, just stop reading it!
I mean, if this isn't a bother.
I, um...
I'm so nervous right now.
I understand.
I'll read it right away.
Come, let's sit by the fire.
It'll be cold today.
Now no one will bother us.
Um, is it okay if I wait downstairs?
Hm?
I'll be fine.
I'm not cold at all.
I don't mind, but...
So there you are.
Shizuku, I've finished reading it.
Thank you.
It was great!
That's not true!
That's not true!
Tell me the truth, please!
I couldn't even organize the story!
The second half is all messed up!
I realize it myself!
That's true.
It's a bit rough, unpolished, and incomplete.
Just like Seiji's violins!
You've shown me the very first jewel you've crafted.
I know you tried hard.
You did great.
There's no reason to hurry.
Take your time and polish it up.
Come on, it's cold out here.
Let's go in.
I...
I found out after I wrote the whole thing!
Just wanting to write isn't enough!
I need to study more!
But...
Seiji is going so much faster than I am!
I forced myself to write it, but I was so scared!
I was so scared!
You really like Seiji, don't you?
How does it taste?
It tastes great.
I had noodles with Seiji, too.
The first time he made a violin.
That was a jumbo serving too.
Ah, thank you.
Well, how far did we get before?
You were a transfer student in Germany and you found the Baron at a cafe.
Right, right.
It's sort of melancholy
But I was attracted by his expression.
I pleaded with the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't do it.
He said, "This feline Baron has a companion. "
"You can't separate two lovers like that. "
The Baron is awaiting the return of his Baroness
Who was sent out for repairs.
But that's just like my story.
That's right!
What a coincidence, huh?
It was almost the day I had to go home So I thought I had to give up.
But then, my girlfriend spoke up.
She said that when the Baron's companion returned she would make sure that the two figurines stayed together.
The proprietor finally gave in.
I only took the Baron with me when I moved
And left the other behind.
I told my girlfriend to hold onto the figurine for me
Until I came back for her.
I told her that the two figurines would meet when the two of us meet again.
But the war started right after that.
And I couldn't keep my promise.
When I finally went back to that town, I searched all over.
But in the end I couldn't find
Either her or the Baron's love.
She was very important to you, wasn't she?
The Baron was really just a sad part of my past but you've brought him alive in a story of hope.
Oh, that's right.
Now, hold out your hands.
This stone is more appropriate for you.
I'm giving it to you.
Please work hard and create your own story.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye!
I'm back.
Where's Father?
Taking a bath.
What time do you think it is right now?
I'm sorry I've worried you.
As of now, I'm going back to being a regular student.
You don't have to worry anymore.
So you're done testing yourself?
Just for now
Have you eaten?
There's curry.
No, thanks.
Just for now, huh?
I'm coming in, Shizuku.
Go take your bath.
Sleeping like a soldier.
Well, then...
It can't be!
W... wait a minute!
It's a miracle!
I got to see you!
This isn't a dream, right?
My flight was a day early.
Get on!
Oh, wait.
You'll be cold like that.
C'mon, get on.
I'll go get my coat.
There isn't time!
Just get on.
Hold on tight now.
I really wanted to see you, Shizuku.
I don't know how long I thought, "Shizuku!"
And then, you really did poke your head out!
We're really amazing!
I wanted to see you, too.
It still feels like a dream!
How was Cremona?
It's very different from what I'd heard, but I'll still do it.
Wow, it's getting really light.
Getting cold?
Should I get off?
It's okay.
I decided...
I wanted to take this hill
With you on the bike!
That's not fair at all!
I don't want to be just a piece of luggage!
I want to be doing something, too!
All right!
Please help.
Just a little farther.
Shizuku!
Hurry and get on!
'Kay.
We're in time!
Need a hand?
I'm fine.
This way.
Incredible!
The morning mist looks almost like the ocean!
This is my own secret place.
It's almost time.
This is what I wanted you to see.
Grandpa told me what you've been doing.
I didn't do anything to help you.
I was only thinking of myself.
No.
I was doing it because of you!
I'm glad I got to challenge myself.
I learned a little more about myself.
I'm going to study harder.
I've decided that I'm going to high school, too.
Shizuku, listen...
I, uh... of course I don't mean right now, but...
Will you marry me?
!
I know I'll become a master violin maker!
And then, we can...
Yes.
You mean it?
!
I'm so glad!
I've been hoping for the same thing!
Really!
Alright!
Hold it.
The wind's pretty cold.
Shizuku, I love you!

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it?
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say no.
Pour me some too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please, I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's too.
No.
Onee-chan wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar code system.
I like the book cards better.
Me too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
- You're right!
- Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my professor will complain.
Note:
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Yeah.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before.
Here too.
Note:
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji.
What's he like?
Is he good-looking?
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse!
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny.
Try by the phone...
Found it!
Just where you left it...
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
Yahoo!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Try your best!
Kosaka-sensei, are you there?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
- Let me in the library!
- What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
Don't forget, you've got high school entrance exams.
- Hurry it up!
- Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Note:
Donated
"Amasawa." Sensei!
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun, I get more freckles!
S-Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Sensei!
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
White clouds spreading up over a hill
A road winds up to the town
An old house with small windows
An old dog waits for me to come home
Country road leading far away
The road to my old hometown
West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain
My good old hometown
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
Concrete roads, everywhere
Cut down all the trees Filled in the valleys
Western Tokyo
Tama Mountain
My hometown is concrete roads
What is this?
!
But what's this problem?
You don't need the lyrics yet.
No.
Are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
- Sugimura!
- That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
But what about the love letter?
I'll think about it awhile.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card.
I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
"I'd forget about Concrete Road."
Get lost!
I'm home.
Onee-chan?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little.
- What about dinner?
- I'm going to wash the rice.
What's this, Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
- Where's Mom?
- Long gone.
Put that stuff away and bring Dad's lunch to him.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper clip off.
- Your boyfriend?
- Idiot!
Hey, cat, are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story.
There he is!
Note:
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here.
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either.
Beautiful doll!
Are you that cat?
- Oh, hello.
- Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll the Baron?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
I'm fine now.
- That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look.
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So, you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
- A princess?
- That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 she is changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad.
This clock's fast, isn't it?
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Goodbye.
Can I come back sometime?
Sure, but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
- Thanks, but how?
- Guess!
The cat.
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
Concrete roads, everywhere...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are.
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
- Getting more books?
- Seven more to go.
- Still at it?
What about lunch?
- I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
- Shizuku!
- Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
- I hate all these tests!
- One every day!
- Did you answer?
- No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Kosaka-sensei.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So, you're not just a baseball goof.
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me.
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr. Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Kimura-sensei, do you remember that Dr. Amasawa's given name?
Dr. Amasawa?
It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.
Amasawa Koichi.
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Umm...
Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over.
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...
Right, Shizuku?
Dunno...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't.
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
Oh, Shizuku-sama!
Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old hometowns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
Country road, this old road
If I go right to the end
Got a feeling it'll take me
To that town, country road
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank you!
There too?
!
- Slow down!
- I like this part.
"I left because I was alone and I had nothing.
Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong..."
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow.
- I'll study there.
- Bookworm!
- Later.
- Bye-bye.
Harada.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.
Note:
World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
Nishi Shiro.
Maybe that jerk's name is Nishi too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko-chan's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
- Shizuku!
- What's the matter?
What's with this face?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Huh?
That's bad.
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him.
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
I see.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
I see.
Say hello to her.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada...
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, "Why you, of all people," didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend.
But...
- I'm sorry!
- Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see.
I'm the one who's dense.
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you again.
You don't have to do this.
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home.
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, "Things aren't that easy."
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him being called Ball at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds.
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil...
- Um...
- Would you?
Is your grandfather all right?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer: "angel's room."
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you.
You look sad today, somehow.
- Had enough?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
- Sure!
- Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
- But one of them is yours?
- Yeah.
- Which one?
- That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK?
Please!
Listen...
Please, please, please!
You have to sing too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
Had a dream of living on my own
With no fear of being all alone
Pushed my sadness down inside of me
And pretended I was strong as I could be
Country road, this old road
If you go right to the end
Got a feeling it'll take me
To that town, country road
It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be
I will never ever let a tear show in my eye
If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to
Push away memories
Country road, this old road
Could go right to my hometown
I won't go there, I can't go there
Can't go down that country road
Country road, when tomorrow comes
I'll be like I always am
Want to go back there Can't go back there
Fare thee well
Country road
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock.
Seiji-kun has some pretty friends.
Seiji?
Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah.
Didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says Nishi outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah.
You're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked Concrete Roads too.
You told me to forget that!
- Did I say that?
- Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled, so now she sleeps in!
- Morning!
- Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Note:
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada, I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the midterm, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji-kun?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
- I'm going to Italy.
- What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon then.
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
- The rain's stopping.
- Yeah.
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow.
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school.
What a stupid thing to think.
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
- Hello, Shizuku-chan.
- Hello.
- Welcome back.
- Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books, except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah.
Kinu-chan was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure.
I don't get it.
I'd write every day.
We'd encourage each other.
You can't say "Go for it" to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of Country Roads.
You can express yourself too, unlike me.
"There's lots as good as me."
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time.
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it too.
Sugimura will realize.
Bye.
Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
Muta...
Note: 'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji-kun says the doll is a treasure of yours.
You didn't have to ask.
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not.
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called mica slate.
Look at the seam.
Like that.
It's beautiful!
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.
- Emerald?
The jewel?
- Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins or writing stories is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell.
Seiji-kun!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
Glad I met you before.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
Yeah.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived, and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll maker's apprentice who fashioned us, but Luisa and I were happy
because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until four again?
!
It's OK.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So, you are home.
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm home!
Welcome back.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
- I've found a place.
- But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working, but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Not going to high school?
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle school education?
I can decide my own future!
Don't get too cocky!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.
But Dad, listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho, can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
- Where's your mother?
- At the Tanakas.
- I'm back.
- Hi, Mom.
- Is your dad back?
- Yes.
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
- Dear!
- Oh, sorry.
Just one moment.
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
- Yeah.
We're a family.
- Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku.
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So, smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa, you've finally come, but I've grown so old.
Shizuku-san.
Come in.
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
Note:
Whisper of the Heart
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding.
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course, but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku-san, I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished, just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now...
Now that I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more, but Seiji-kun's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared.
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...
Yes, yes.
He looked so melancholic.
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes, quite the coincidence.
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back, she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you.
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes.
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
Sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So, your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry.
I'm fine!
"For now."
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No way!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait, you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
"Shizuku!"
And then you appeared!
What a team we are!
Me too.
It's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
- Shall I get off?
- It's OK.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.
No, you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku.
I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait, it's cold.
Shizuku, I love you!

- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say 'no'!
Pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come there.
- Thanks.
The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You smoke too much.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.
I like the book-cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.
Seiji Amasawa
This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
Seiji Amasawa
He's taken all these books out before me.
Seiji Amasawa...what's he like?
Wonder if he's nice.
Seiji Amasawa
Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
'Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes!
...where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Clumsy!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Keep it up!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
20?
You've got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
Donated Amasawa's Collection
'Amasawa' ...
Miss!
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah...alright, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
'White clouds spreading up over a hill... '...a road winds up to the town.'
'An old house with small windows...
'An old dog waits for me to come home...
'Country road leading far away...
'The road to my old home town...
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...
'My good old home town.'
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
'Concrete roads, everywhere...
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...
'Western Tokyo...
'Tama Mountain...
'My home town is concrete roads.'
What is this?
!
But what's this 'problem'?
You don't need the lyrics yet...
No...are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
!
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Confess!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you?
I'll think about it a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
- Oh, no!
- What?
I forgot my book!
I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, 'Shizuku Tsukishima'.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'
Get lost!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.
Me?
!
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey cat...are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I get off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll 'the Baron'?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face...if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it...
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure...but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Shizuku Tsukishima!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks...but how...?
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
'Concrete roads, everywhere' ...
It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
No!
He's not you!
Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
- Tsukishima!
- What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?
Dr Amasawa?
It was 'Koichi'.
Koichi Amasawa...
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.
You don't know him?
He is?
!
Thank you very much!
Excuse us!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?
!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
Of all the nerve!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
!
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?
- You finished?
!
- Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
'Country road, this old road...
'If I go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!
There, too?
!
Slow down!
I like this part.
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong...'
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
'Bye
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone...maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium;
Shiro Nishi, Prop.
'Shiro Nishi' ...maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
'Bye.
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
!
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, ' Why you, of all people, ' didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
!
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
!
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
!
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I'm the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you...again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!
'
I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
- Um...
- Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you talk like that with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, okay?
Please!
Listen...
Please please please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
'Had a dream of living on my own... '...with no fear of being all alone.
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me... '...and pretended I was strong as I could be.
'Country road, this old road...
'If you go right to the end...
'Got a feeling it'll take me... '...to that town, country road.'
'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye...
'If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to... '...push away memories...
'Country road, this old road... '...could go right to my home town...
'I won't go there, I can't go there... '...can't go down that country road.
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...
'I'll be like I always am...
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...
'Fare thee well... '...country road.'
That was fun!
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends.
'Seiji'?
Are you Seiji Amasawa?
Yeah...didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says 'Nishi' outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Seiji Amasawa...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah...you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1:
Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
!
A little bird...who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's okay.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
- Um...
- Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me, too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
- Here.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's alright.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books except one's going forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.
'There's lots as good as me'.
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
- You going?
- Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it, too.
Sugimura will realize.
'Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta!
'Muta' ...
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called 'mica slate'.
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins, or writing stories, is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids converge!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
Go!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...
He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's okay.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
Luisa, my betrothed, and I were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until 4 again?
!
It's okay.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry to trouble you.
This way...is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped enough just with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with marks like this?
!
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
What can you do with a middle-school education?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school makes its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work part-time!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku...that's enough.
But Dad...
listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do so care about my marks!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself?
How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh...sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only the one is real.
Which is the real one?
!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa...you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
I promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel!
'Whisper of the Heart'
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's okay.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course...but...
You're asleep here?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes...it's rough, blunt, unfinished just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now now I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, don't you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes...quite the coincidence!
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
So the owner gave in.
I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.
And I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very important to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.
So your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine!
'For now' ...
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane.
Hop on.
Wait...you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
'Shizuku!
'
And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too...it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's alright.
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
Okay!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Jump on!
We made it!
- I'll hold the coat.
- I'm fine.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No...you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku I can't say how soon it'll be, but would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait...it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!

Presents As the cogs begin to tum one by one, the machine is put into motion.
Once in motion, the machine conveys various things to people.
What I convey to people are dreams...
Momentary dreams.
Yes, I am an amusement park.
Riding on my dreams...
The wheels of love go into motion.
Countless lovers meet...
gaze at each other... and hug each other.
And I've seen them all.
The wheels of love can be whimsical at times.
It may stop moving without warning.
A person's heart does not work like a machine.
That's why.
The lovers call that "broken heart."
Broken Heart
December
Did you know...
A couple that kisses at the peak of this Ferris Wheel, will find happiness.
They just say that for advertisement.
Why do you spoil the mood?
Christmas and Valentine's Day exist for the profits of sweet shops.
They make a business out of romance, too.
I'm going to have another live concert.
Come to it.
No.
I've been to enough of your boring concerts.
Don't put it down.
It's going to be better this time!
We're going to rap too!
Quiet!
It'll be the same!
Only family and friends will be there again!
Don't put it like that!
Will you sell 20 tickets?
That's impossible.
I have a miai meeting.
I see.
Is that all you have to say?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put you in a spot.
I'll tum it down.
My father arranged it without my approval.
I wish he wouldn't stick his neck into my life.
He asked me if I was open this Sunday.
Isn't that awfully sudden?
I know where your father is coming from.
After all, I'm a father.
A daughter will always remain a daughter.
I like it the way it is.
I'm happy the way things are right now.
My wife wants to see me this Sunday.
She said she's bringing my daughter along, so we decided to meet here.
I'm not happy with the way things are.
That's when I scored the winning point!
Wow!
Did they televise it?
No.
We're with JFL.
Are they better than the J-League?
It's not an issue of which team is better...
I love men who play sports.
They chase after the white ball dash about the grounds... and sweat.
In soccer, the balls have speckles.
Can I go to cheer you on?
Sure!
I'll reserve the best seat for you.
Will you really?
I want to be behind the net.
Okay.
I'll hit a homerun for you.
We haven't known each other for very long.
We know each other well enough.
The saying was true...
That couples that kiss here find happiness.
Do you believe in those things?
I want to believe in it.
You should only believe in yourself.
You must grasp happiness on your own.
What shall we do about the wedding hall?
Am I jumping the gun... by trying to plan our wedding ceremony?
I'm so happy!
5 minutes 57 seconds.
Can you go home late?
Good.
I want to take you to a place I frequent.
Game is over.
What do you think, Section Chief?
Stop calling me Section Chief.
But that's your title.
Section Chief Yanagida of Games Development.
To think the prestigious Toto Movie Company is entering the game development business.
We're living in a multi-media world.
Games development is the leading amusement.
True amusement comes from... the appearance of stars on a huge screen... and the hero defeating evil.
Then a happy ending with the beautiful heroine.
That's entertainment.
Haven't you heard of virtual reality?
The company entered the game development field to have an interactive connection between virtual reality and movies.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Please wait.
Please experience it.
It'll open your eyes.
Which is the front?
Why do I have to wear this?
Welcome, everyone.
I must deliver this secret information to Earth from now.
Will it be the red team or the green team that will accompany me?
The team that arises victorious will have the glory to accompany me to Earth.
The person who gets the highest score will have the highest glory.
The time for battle has come!
Let's go!
Please fight in there.
I'll be watching.
Who, in here, will become my partner and hero, to save Earth?
Let's go!
He must've got the date wrong.
He would mistake the day of our dates, too.
He must think it's for next Sunday!
Brother!
Where's the groom?
Wasn't Kimihiko at home?
He cancelled the wedding reception and took off with the money.
He ran off with the reception payment?
Morimura Kimihiko and Ogawa Michiko...
The wedding reception will be for SO-people on March 3rd.
That's fine.
I'll be needing a deposit of 700,000 yen.
I'll be taking this as a deposit then.
If we didn't have to make a payment today,
I would've paid for it.
The earlier the better, for things like this.
Don't let it bother you.
Isn't your boyfriend an adult?
He's 25 years old.
Don't you have an adult relationship?
I want my boyfriend to learn a thing or two.
Is that why you want to have a double date?
You'll make yourself look easy.
It might serve as good stimulation.
Please?
Okay, okay-
Really?
Thanks.
I'll treat you sometime.
Red or green?
Heart or diamond?
Shall I take love or the ring?
We're going with the green.
OK?
Heart.
Let's go with the red.
What?
It's the heart.
More than the ring.
It's love.
One moment please.
It's your father on the line.
Thanks.
Go with the heart.
Okay.
Hello?
It's me.
I'm okay with the miai meeting.
Don't get so happy.
No parents, though.
Let me decide where we'll meet.
Don't worry .
Kimono?
I'm not wearing a kimono.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Were you stood up?
Someone stood me up, too.
So I thought found a friend!
Don't make me a friend.
Let us, the jilted ones, go on a date together.
Leave me alone.
He'll be here soon.
Why don't we do this?
If he doesn't come in another 30 minutes, you'll enjoy a date with me.
OK?
You're wasting your time.
He will come.
If he comes, that's fine.
I'm starting the time.
Aren't you a middle-aged beginner?
I give up.
5...4...3...2...1...0.
Your 30 minutes are up.
Let's go.
I don't remember promising you anything.
You can't go back on your word now.
You decided that on your own.
Stop it.
I have a steady boyfriend!
He stood you up.
You should talk.
I lied.
What?
I lied about meeting someone there.
That's howl pick up girls who were stood up.
But it was love at first sight with you.
Isn't that part of your pick-up line?
No, it's not.
I'm serious.
Do you love him that much?
Let's do this.
I'll be waiting for you here on Valentine's Day.
If you break up with him by then, come here with a box of chocolates.
I won't be coming.
If you don't show up, I'll assume that you're doing fine with him.
OK?
Do as you want.
I'm sorry to bring my work here.
I'm impressed that you can send in your work from a place like this.
What kind of TV commercials have you made?
We deal with papers.
Do you do commercials for tissue papers?
We're into the paper media...
like magazines.
Let's not talk about this.
Have you ever worked as a model?
No.
There's an audition for models coming up.
Do you want to try for it?
I'm not pretty enough.
You're very pretty-
I'll call the producer now.
Do you carry two phones?
I would you like to come to my house from now to discuss the details?
Are you sure you don't mind working at this hour?
I wouldn't mind working 24 hours with you.
Is that true?
It sure is.
The high score today goes to Mr. Maruyama.
Congratulations.
You are the strongest warrior... and my greatest partner.
How many times have you won already?
What is he planning to do with all those badges?
I see a group of men... extending their hands out.
I feel bad vibes.
You're going to make the men unhappy.
I don't believe that.
You should buy this ball and pray to it everyday to get rid of that evil.
Are you trying to sell your merchandise?
Don be insulting!
You'll be damned for taking this crystal ball lightly!
It's a crystal ball that works with electricity.
Don't destroy my business equipment.
Go get another one from the far end of space.
What are you doing?
Thanks.
I had fun.
Don't forget my chocolates.
Goodbye.
I forgot to get her name.
I'm sure I'll see her again.
There are four aces here.
The ace of hearts represents "love."
The ace of diamonds represents 'money."
Which will you choose, love or money?
While you were deciding, they both disappeared.
Next is...
Wait a minute!
I know you're good.
But you don't seem to fit the image for it.
This attire has to go!
You're not a pizza delivery person.
I used to do deliveries.
You need a different image for it!
How about this?
You used to work for a mafia family in New York.
But because you were highly accurate in your predictions, another mafia group sent a hitman after you.
So you had to flee to a foreign country.
You're a godbrother that wanders around the world.
A man who holds the ace of cards to the underworld!
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean?
You touched my body!
I just brushed against you!
You're a masher!
What?
Don't give yourself too much credit.
I'm reporting you to the police.
Give me a break!
I won't forget that lewd face of yours!
Now that's an honor!
December
Emi insisted on it.
It's OK, isn't it?
I don't want to hang out with an adult.
He'll make me feel uncomfortable.
Don't do anything embarrassing, OK?
Am I an embarrassment?
That's not what I meant.
There they are!
Did you wait long?
Not at all.
This is Sakai Tatsuya.
Hello.
I'm Sakai.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Let's take a picture.
Smile.
Thanks.
Let's take another one.
This is an unique place to have a miai.
Thought I'd let you see my workplace.
A sound coordinator?
I'm still learning.
Sounds like a very creative job.
You could set a trend with your songs.
I wish I could compose such great hit songs.
Do you give UP?
Frustrating, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama has won 20 consecutive times.
Please give him a round of applause.
What is your name?
Sachiko.
Your opportunity lies in the future, not in the past.
In the future?
Yes, that's right.
Yes, I understand.
I'll do my best at it.
Thank you.
Next person.
What can I do for you?
I want to know my fortune in love.
Okay.
With someone you are seeing now?
Or with someone you will meet from now?
Someone in the future.
I have no one now.
Excuse me.
Let me look into your future encounter.
Your previous relationships didn't work out?
We would hit it off well at the beginning.
But they end up getting sick of me.
You are strong-natured.
What?
You lash out at men very quickly.
For example, "Lewd face"!
I don't say such things.
Your problem lies in that attitude.
But you're actually very kind deep down.
I see a fateful encounter for you.
Didn't you brush against a man in town recently?
Oh, that masher.
He's not a masher!
He's your fateful man.
Him?
You're displaying a bad attitude again.
I'm sorry.
Will you really be OK?
Do I have to ride this?
Yes.
If you don't like me, come out and say it.
What?
Aren't you trying to make me dislike you?
Isn't that why you're acting awful?
You should just turn me down straight.
Do I look like such an awful woman?
No.
I'm sorry.
I guess you're right.
I'm a very awful woman.
I'm sorry for wasting your clay.
It may not tum out to be a waste.
The day has just started.
You're a positive person.
I try to be.
After all, I'm a doctor.
The fear that awaits... is thrilling!
I love this tension!
Is that how you are?
Yes, this is howl am!
I'm going to take a picture.
Wait.
What is she doing?
That was great!
Shall we ride it again?
Do you want to take a short break?
That sounds good.
I need more than attitude in life.
Let's sit down.
Dear, what's wrong?
Are you all right?
Please brace yourself.
Please excuse me.
Are you all right?
Excuse me...
I'm a doctor.
He seems anemic.
Let's go to my hospital.
I'll examine him there.
No, I'm fine.
Why do you say that?
Let's get a check-up.
I'm going to the hospital with them.
Would you like to come along?
No, it's okay.
It's your tum to see my workplace.
They're not around.
Let's just forget about them.
The purpose of a double date is to change partners and to get to know the other party.
Let's go there.
There's a long line.
I told her to go ahead.
Isn't she your girlfriend?
Don't make excuses.
You should keep him chained to you.
We haven't been getting along too well lately.
I think we're losing sight of each other.
It didn't matter who we came with...
I just wanted a change of pace.
But?
It's scary when things are too different.
The scary part is yet to come!
Where did they go?
Shall we go home?
Yes, let's do that.
The test results will be back on Monday.
Please come Monday morning, the 26th.
Thank you.
Please take care.
I'm sorry to spoil your clay off.
Here you are, Papa.
Thanks.
Papa, I want to use the bathroom.
It's this way.
Thank you.
Are you OK?
I heard you weren't feeling well for a while.
So you told that to your separated wife.
Your miai meeting was coincidentally at the amusement park?
It's not like you to do this.
What's the matter?
I don't know why I did this myself.
I didn't do it on purpose.
I have a bad sense of direction.
Let's all go again.
Let's stay together next time.
Why don't just the two of you go?
Welcome.
Set "A" with a coffee.
That'll be 515 yen.
Please wait a moment.
Thank you for waiting.
Thank you for your business.
Okay.
I'll tell him.
I'll be looking forward to it!
What a miai meeting it turned into.
I'm sorry for choosing the amusement park.
It's slow today.
Do you know Mr. Fujikawa?
Why do You ask?
He doesn't feel like a stranger to me.
As a doctor I've seen many people die.
When I see someone near my age,
I get caught up in my feelings...
Is he...?
He has liver cancer.
It can spread fast.
I wondered what I would do if I knew I only had a few months left to live.
Excuse me.
Yes?
We do not allow mashers to stay at this hotel.
Are you still here?
I'll do what I want.
Why are you following me?
I live in this direction.
Are you still after my nice body?
What's so nice about your body?
Stop looking at me with those lewd eyes.
Stay out of my range of view then.
Get out of my range of view!
Why is he my fateful man?
Got any extra tickets?
I'll buy them from you.
I have two extra tickets.
I have two extra tickets.
January
Thank you for always coming to play.
You've gotten good in a very short time.
Not really.
You really did.
We're having a tournament here on February 14th.
Would you like to enter it?
I'm too old for that.
I thought you'd be great as the next champion.
I was hoping that you would replace him.
I'll be sure to make it.
I'll be expecting you.
Please do your best at it.
You're very compatible with him.
You make a perfect match.
A mother and wife supports a slightly loose husband.
You make an ideal couple.
The only thing is...
You shouldn't keep secrets from each other.
You shouldn't lie to each other.
Because the truth will come out someday.
Don't you agree?
I found a nice condominium in Hawaii.
Would you like to buy it together?
What?
Why would we want a villa in Hawaii?
If we put down a deposit of two million yen, the monthly payments will be easy to make.
Aren't you lying?
Why would I lie to you?
Have I ever lied to you?
I'm only kidding.
I was influenced by that fortune-teller earlier.
Do you believe in those things?
I'm not hiding anything from you.
That's true.
That man earlier was funny.
He must be hiding something from someone.
As I was saying...
Is he really my fateful man?
Is there a problem with him?
No.
The problem is probably with me.
What should I do then?
That's what I came to ask you.
Please tell me what to do.
Let's see...
So you knew each other.
I'm sorry.
I lied to you when I had the miai meeting.
It's okay.
I've been through it 20 times already.
I wanted to see what his wife looks like.
All of a sudden, too.
I didn't care before.
She had the divorce papers in her handbag that day.
But after he got hospitalized, she's been at his side everyday.
A bachelor wouldn't understand how it is between a married couple.
Can't he be saved?
He wanted to take the surgery route.
Please cure him.
I like you.
I think I'll be happy if I married you.
But I want him to see it.
I want him to see me happy.
That is why I don't want him to die yet.
I'm sorry.
I'm so selfish, aren't I?
I didn't even think about how you feel and
I'm rambling about marriage and happiness with you.
I understand.
February.
An amusement park...
How indecent!
Why?
It looks nice and healthy to me.
That couple is going to have sex later.
I have no such intention.
Of course.
I'm different from your other women.
You were very straight forward in your pick-up act, so I took a liking to you.
Did I make a mistake?
No, you didn't.
I'm more than you expect.
Really?
I'm already here anyway.
Will you ride all the rides I want to ride?
Of course.
I'm going to change.
Do you always can-y around a change of clothes?
Of course.
What a kid.
Aren't you dressed up?
What?
No.
What is it?
I've been here for a while.
Where's Tatsuya?
He couldn't make it.
He had to work all of a sudden.
Is that true?
That's what he said.
I don't know if he's really working though.
What shall we do?
We're already here.
This is nice for a change.
You want 500,000 dollars?
That'd not funny.
I'm hanging "P-
You can hang up if you wish.
Don't you care what happens to your daughter?
Is she really with you?
Please get the money ready.
I'll notify you later as to where to deliver it.
I won't forgive you if you lay a finger on her!
Who'd want to lay a finger on that kid!
Who are you calling?
Let's go.
Thanks.
What're you going to do with that?
It's a present for you.
Why don't you write "Girlfriend Wanted"
and post it all over town?
That's mean.
I could display it here.
I'm going!
Go, if you want!
The Roller Coaster is smoother than this!
I get stressed when I see couples get married day in and day out!
And you have your driver's license?
Get off my case!
If you had a car, we wouldn't be here!
Why don't you be honest with yourself?
I love you!
Why did you say that all of a sudden?
I just wanted to tell you that.
Stop joking around.
I'm not joking.
I'm in love with someone now.
He's a fortune-teller.
I can be myself with him.
That hurts.
Sorry-
I'm sorry for jilting you.
I'm going to tell him I love him the next time I see him.
You're going to get crushed.
Don't tell me that, when you just got jilted.
Ouch!
This song is for you.
It sounded wonderful.
Did you enjoy it?
It's my tum to enjoy it.
You're all the same.
I want to experience love.
I'm ready for love.
I was hoping to have a wonderful romance.
No one sees me for who I am.
I do!
I must have bad judgment in men.
What're you saving?
You have to go with the flow!
Stop it!
Don't play hard to get!
You approached me!
Ouch!
Where do you think you are kicking?
Stop resisting!
You're going through with this!
Stop screaming!
He couldn't make it.
This is so silly!
That's enough!
What're you doing?
Hey!
Stop!
Do you want to go to the aid station?
Leave me alone.
Didn't you call your girlfriend earlier?
I can redial and find out.
Your boyfriend is trying to pick up a female middle school student.
Who is this?
Are you the one who called earlier?
That's my dad's voice.
Hey!
Say something!
Why did you call my home?
Is this a case of kidnap?
Wait a minute.
If you kill me, you'll be sentenced to death.
It won't be good for you.
That doesn't scare me.
Go ahead and kill me.
I thought we could be good friends.
I thought!
had finally found a friend.
If you let me go home, I'll keep it a secret.
I'll tell my dad that it was a mere prank.
You spoiled my perfect plan.
Things don't go the way you want it to.
I have to go home now.
Let's go on another date.
Let's ride the Roller Coaster.
What?
It's night and it's dark.
That's why it'll be fun.
Not for me.
I see.
How about another ride then?
I don't want anything high.
It'll be cold.
Just take a hot bath.
Where do I take a bath?
Why don't you go to a hotel?
What're you saving?
Don't make such a face.
I'm sure it's fun for you two.
What's with you?
She's upset that Tatsuya didn't come.
It's too bad for you.
What was that for!
?
Don't you take a bath together?
Please keep the event time schedule in your heads.
Let's discuss the details of the parade.
Is 1,500 okay?
Sounds good.
The open ground for the event... will toe managed by Goto and Sato.
As for the marine gate...
We expect it to be very crowded here.
Nakanishi, please handle this area alone.
P.R. Planning.
This is Yamamura speaking.
Yes?
Mr. Fujikawa passed away this morning...
Thank you!
Please listen to what I have to say.
Those photos aren't what you think.
I wanted to break up with Tatsuya.
He's seeing another woman now.
I wanted to show him those photos and break up from my side.
Koji just went along with it to help me out.
But Tatsuya walked out on me before I could show him those photos.
Do you honestly think I'd believe that?
It's up to you to believe it or not.
Welcome!
Set A with cola.
Coffee for me.
You come here often, don't you?
Stop acting like a detective.
I'm not.
What do you want?
A date.
It's over with him.
Valentine's Day is the second anniversary for the amusement park so it will be open all night.
Koji wants to go with you.
I'm not going.
My dad caused this accident.
This person that died...
Yoshizawa Yumi... was a 21-year old student.
I get it now.
Your dad killed her in an accident, but got away scot-free with it.
He's the secretary of a Dietman.
They must've pulled some strings to help him.
Have you seen a little of his dirty side?
I already knew that.
I've known him for over ten years.
Then you should know why I tried to do that.
I get it.
You were in love with that person.
Very deeply.-
It said in a book that crime starts with love, rather than with hate.
I haven't read it.
Let's do it again.
The kidnap.
Didn't you think up the perfect plan?
Don't be stupid.
It'll work out fine, since I, the hostage, will cooperate with you.
Besides...
That day, my dad had the ransom money ready.
There's still 500,000 dollars at home.
February
I'll be leaving first.
The cancellation fee will be 30%.
Will that be okay?
That's fine.
Please verify the amount.
I thought you went to Hawaii.
Since you're here...
Let's go to the amusement park.
They're having a 2nd anniversary event.
Let's go.
We have the top warriors gathered here today.
You won't be fighting in teams today.
It'll be a survival game.
The battle will go on till the last warrior.
The person who is the last survivor... will become my partner.
I wish you success!
You're getting a call.
Get off at the next station.
Bye.
I won't see you again.
That's a promise.
It said in the book that you don't meet with your accomplice again.
I've always liked amusement parks.
But I always came alone.
Even when I became an adult.
You are the first man I came with.
It's probably my father's fault.
Your father who passed away?
He was a police officer.
Did that scare you?
You're not the only one who reacted that way.
Every man has done a thing or two that he feels guilty about.
They feel like they have to abide by the rules if they go out with me.
So no one wanted to take me out for a drive.
You may have a point.
I had no luck with men.
Marriage was far beyond my dreams.
When you asked me to many you...
I felt like I was on cloud nine.
I was very happy-
Yes?
Ride the train in the amusement park.
Dam!
I hate to be ordered around.
Have you heard the story about Wingle and the ring?
Wingle would go around the village, selling rings.
And he would put a high price on them.
But they would sell well.
He would target the lonely women, and...
They would almost always buy.
One day, he fell seriously in love with a woman.
He couldn't sell her a fake ring.
He bought an authentic ring with all the profits he had made thus far.
And he delivered it to that woman.
But the woman looked at the ring and said...
Why, this is a fake?
Didn't you just borrow the reception money?
Please say that's it.
I'm not a stupid ring vendor.
I would've believed Wingle's ring was real.
I'm a con artist.
Let go of your silly pride as a con artist.
You do get it, do you?
It's my pride as a man.
Yes?
Did you bring a binocular?
Yes, I did.
Look at the top of the Ferris Wheel.
Now, drop the money.
N ow!
He dropped the money.
Dam!
We're in a tunnel!
Hello?
Where are you?
Go to the tunnel!
This is what you get for playing around and not studying!
Don't you understand the trouble you've caused?
The election is just around the comer!
What're you going to do if I lose because of this?
Eh Si"!
something!
What's that penguin?
That's not our penguin.
That's it!
The culprit is dressed in a penguin costume.
He's in the open ground on the west side.
A penguin costume?
I'll be right over.
Be sure to capture him!
Our country is too lenient on the youngsters!
We need to be strict!
A penguin costume?
There!
Stop.
I'm going to borrow this!
Slop!
That's not a car!
Clear the way!
Slop!
Slop!
Too bad for you!
I'm right here!
Watch out!
Clear the way!
Great!
Wait!
What're you doing here?
Take me with you.
We promised not to see each other again.
I want to go with you.
I love you.
We lost sight of him in this area.
Can he get out?
There's no road.
The waterway connects to the sea.
There's the penguin!
It's going out in a motorboat!
Slop!
Penguin, dock the boat!
Slop!
Go around to the other side!
Slop!
The bridge is coming down!
You can't get away!
Slop!
Stop, I said!
You can't get away now!
We got you, villain!
Say something!
Kidnapping is a very serious crime.
Congratulations.
You are the best warrior.
And my partner.
Your partner?
Thank you for coming.
This is an ancient Chinese method of fortune-telling.
Under which star does your happiness lie?
Where is the other man?
The godbrother?
You mustn't trust him.
He irresponsibly quit his job this morning.
The mafia hitmen must have found him.
Are you alone today?
Isn't this the first time you came here alone?
I've been watching you for a while now.
You didn't seem happy.
I'm sorry.
I haven't rode this yet.
Will you ride it with me?
Today is my last day here.
I wanted to ride it once before I quit.
Will you let me think about it while it goes around once?
So you're being cautious.
I've changed.
Sure.
Think about it carefully.
He asked me to give you this.
He made an outrageous request.
He wants you to put the two sides together.
Will you look through it?
Well?
Isn't it something?
This is the passage for the parade!
Please clear the way!
We're ready on this side!
The parade will be starting shortly!
Isn't she coming?
It's dangerous so please stand back!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Take her to the aid station!
It's nearby!
Please stand back.
Are you okay?
Can you continue?
I'm fine.
Hang in there.
We'll continue with the parade!
The parade is moving smoothly on this end!
Are you okay?
Good.
I'm sorry.
I can't many you.
I have to tum you down.
I see.
As long as you keep loving him...
He won't lose his love, even in death.
And I, who am live here, have a broken heart.
I'll choose the happiness in life anytime.
I am alive...
So what's a broken heart?
Don't you agree?
If he were alive...
He would've been the one with the broken heart.
The wheels of love will move smoothly this time.
I was just better at coping with the new form of media.
The world is changing at a tremendous speed.
Those who sluggishly watch the movies, will be left behind the times.
You may be right about that.
You were my goal for a long time.
Am I a symbol of your high score?
I didn't mean it like that.
But I...
I shouldn't be saying this when I work there.
But I find it hard to accept a person who gets so engrossed in a game.
You can't accept it?
My family has a theatre.
I used to work in the theatrical field before.
Is that right?
My family is thinking of going into the game center business.
But I would rather have them keep the theatre.
That must be why...
I don't like the people at the game center.
I wish you happiness with your boyfriend.
We haven't been alone in a while.
Too bad we can't start over as strangers.
It's not possible, is it?
After all, Emi and I...
Wasn't that all an act?
Yes, that's right.
You should've told me so.
What are we, anyway?
What brought that on?
We can't even get a broken heart from it.
Number 4 is leading now.
The grand champion contest is coming up.
Who will be the victor?
Number 4 stays in the lead.
He just crashed.
Will he be okay?
Clear the way!
Or you'll get hurt!
Life isn't as romantic as in the movies!
Who cares about multi-media and virtual reality!
Hey!
I'm right here!
Hey!
Hey!
The boat won't stop for me, will it?
What's your name?
What?
I can't hear you.
What's your name?
Ozawa Asami!
I should've asked before.
We'll see each other again, won't we?
I'm sure we'll see each other again.
It's pretty, isn't it?
What I relay to people are dreams...
Momentary dreams.
Yes, I'm the amusement park.
Once upon a time... on the north shore of Long Island... not far from New York... there was a very, very large mansion... almost a castle... where there lived a family by the name of Larrabee.
There were servants inside the mansion... and servants outside the mansion.
Boatmen to tend the boats... and six crews of gardeners... two for the solarium... the rest for the grounds... and a tree surgeon on retainer.
There were specialists for the indoor tennis courts... and the outdoor tennis courts... the outdoor swimming pool and the indoor swimming pool.
And over the garage... there lived a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild... imported from England years ago... together with a Rolls-Royce... and a daughter named Sabrina.
In the moonlight
When the shadows play
When the thought of what could happen
Takes your breath away
Sighs and whispers
Quiet laughter in the air
Can make it seem that love is everywhere
Among other things... the Larrabees were noted for the parties they gave.
Few people anymore give parties the way they did.
It never rained on the night of a Larrabee party.
The Larrabees wouldn't have stood for it.
In the half-light Can we trust...
There was Maude Larrabee... who inherited the Larrabee Corporation... when her husband died on the 13th hole at Pebble Beach.
Sweetheart, go talk to Colonel Morgan.
He looks bored.
Senator!
Have I got somebody I want you to meet.
Maude was on the cover of Fortune.
There was Linus, the older son... who graduated from Yale at 19... and took his mother and the company for a ride... on the fiber-optic highway... and turned a hundred-million-dollar family business... into some serious money.
I just don't feel like buying any more networks this year.
There's never anything good on.
I said the offer expired at 10:00.
It's 10:08, Robert.
Linus was on the cover of Time.
But most of all... there was David... the younger son... who was in and out of many schools and even more relationships.
He was handsome and charming and funny and romantic.
It's so rare to meet such a beautiful woman... with your sense of humor and irony... poetry... and hair color.
David did a Gap ad.
Sabrina?
Sabrina, come down.
She made him laugh.
- You have to finish packing.
- Am I witty?
I wonder if Paris is far away enough.
No, really.
Do you think I'm funny?
Hilarious.
You should host a talk show.
Sabrina, the full-time observation of David Larrabee... is not a recognized profession.
Get out of that tree.
In a minute.
It's just you, Sabrina.
Hello, David.
I thought I heard somebody.
No, it's nobody.
How can I remember things that never happened
Arms that never held me
Lips I've never kissed
How can I remember
Why do I keep seeing
Someone's face before me
Eyes that say they know me
Shining through the mist
Eyes that I remember
I don't know why
Or when or where
Sabrina?
You've spent more of your life up that tree... than you have on solid ground.
You know how lucky we are that Mrs. Larrabee... has friends who have a job for you... so you can have this European experience?
The time in Paris will be so good for you.
If your mother were alive, she'd be so happy.
- It's what she always wanted.
- What if he forgets all about me?
How can he forget someone he doesn't know exists?
I didn't mean that.
I just meant... there's much more to you than this obsession.
I hope you know that.
Thanks, Dad.
Good night.
How can I remember things
That never happened
Arms that never held me
Lips I've never kissed
I need more help.
Where you going?
It's early.
It'll take me half an hour to get out of here.
I gotta check on the Tokyo market before it closes.
Good night.
Linus, Andrea Colson told me you just fired her son.
He's an idiot.
But she was a bridesmaid at my wedding.
- She's one of my best friends.
- This is business, Mother.
Listen, I gotta drop something off in David's room.
When he surfaces from this week's love of his life... tell him I put his suspenders back in his closet.
You're not leaving now.
You'll miss my fireworks.
It's okay, Mother.
I had a pony ride and I got my face painted.
Good night.
Come in.
I came to say good-bye.
- What?
- Don't come out.
If I look at you, I might not be able to get through this.
Please don't say anything.
I'm leaving tomorrow for Paris... and I'll be away a long time.
I don't expect you to think about me while I'm gone.
You haven't thought about me while I was here.
I just want to say...
I think I know you better than anybody else.
I mean, whatever they think or say, I know the truth... that you're a wonderful person... kind and generous and... and, for what it's worth, know that someone... very far away is thinking of you.
So, if there's anything I can ever do.
Could you bring me one of those little Eiffel Tower paperweights?
Oh, my God!
Welcome to Vogue, Sabrina.
You speak no French, yes?
- No.
- No?
I mean, yes, I don't.
Sorry.
Please, could you repeat the question?
We have many shoes, you see.
Very important.
You know, I speak very good the English.
You pull, then close the plate.
Goes to shoot.
Most important...
Belt.
Ingrid, hurry up.
I'm putting in my contacts.
Another one.
Another one.
The nice one.
Don't worry for Martine.
I tortured her.
Now she tortures you.
Succeed, you'll get someone of your own to torture.
But you've only been there for two weeks.
I doubt every single person in Paris thinks you're an idiot.
Only because I haven't met them all.
Sabrina, you're being much too hard on yourself.
Give it a chance.
Now what matters is you're away from here... experiencing new things... getting another view of the world, finding new friends.
And not constantly thinking about you know who!
Morning, Tom.
She's fine.
She hasn't adjusted completely.
- She's miserable.
I knew it.
- I told you not to send her.
Mr. Tom, maybe this not for me to put my hands in this... but when I first come to this country, I am alone... like Sabrina.
I just weigh more.
So, I ask to God, "Why I am here?"
I say, "Why, God?"
But there is no answer.
So I stop crying.
It takes 11 years!
Thank you, Rosa.
- Did she mention David?
- Just that life without him... is a "hopeless abyss of misery and despair."
I believe those were her words.
Raise your leg.
Yes.
Ooh, yeah.
Have a drink with me.
- Fairchild.
- Good morning, sir.
Hey, Linus!
Got a minute?
David, does it ever occur to you... that you're an officer of the Larrabee Corporation?
I met someone.
Do you recall the address of our building?
It's 389 Park Avenue.
- I'm not kidding.
- Your office is on the 48th floor.
- This is really somebody.
- So what's the problem?
I've invited her for dinner here Friday... and I don't want you and Mother to...
This girl is smart.
She's really smart.
That certainly hasn't come up before.
Listen, Linus, she's a real woman.
- She's not a, you know...
- Transvestite?
She's not a bimbo.
She's a doctor.
- Pediatrician, actually.
- How did you meet her?
I was at this party, and the host's kid got sick with something.
I rushed him over to Lennox Hill Emergency... and she was the resident on duty, and we just hit it right off.
How'd the sick kid make out?
When you guys meet her, just try to make me look good.
I know I look good, but try to make me sound good.
Mention my accomplishments.
My qualities.
You can be creative.
Lie, okay?
She says her folks know you.
- What's her name?
- Elizabeth Tyson.
Tyson Electronics Tyson?
- Tyson I don't know Tyson.
- Here's a toughie.
Which one works for a living?
Wow, great hat, Mother.
Good morning, blue eyes.
Bring her around.
We'll try and make you look good.
You guys work Sundays now?
It's Wednesday, David.
Guess what.
David's taking out Patrick Tyson's daughter.
- Well, well, well.
- Yes, sir?
Mack, give me Harvey.
Harvey, I want you to start buying up chunks of Tyson stock.
Not so much that anybody would notice.
That's it.
I hope she doesn't look like Patrick.
For once your father didn't lie.
- You are lovely.
- Thank you.
- I'm Maude.
- Pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you from my father.
- And you're really a doctor?
- No, he made that up.
She was just promoted to assistant head of pediatrics... and I told her the hospital can count on us... for a couple million dollars.
Is he a world-class philanthropist, or what?
Just squeeze.
I like Louis.
He's funny and sweet and such a good photographer.
But someone is in the way.
Is it this David you mentioned casually... 40 or 50 times when you first came over?
He sounds, perhaps, like an illusion.
He keeps me company.
You think so?
Illusions are dangerous people.
They have no flaws.
I came here from Provence... alone, uneducated.
For eight months...
no, more than that... a year...
I sat in a cafe, I drank coffee... and I wrote nonsense in a journal.
And then, somehow... it was not nonsense.
I went for long walks... and I met myself in Paris.
You seem embarrassed by loneliness... by being alone.
It's only a place to start.
- I'm sorry about your party.
- It's okay.
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll draw you a hot bath, whip us up a superb omelet.
Do you have eggs, cheese, green pepper, tomato?
No green pepper.
No tomato.
Oh, well, then I'll just whip us up... a somewhat superb omelet.
David, you are the best.
You mean, making a hot bath and an omelet are... roughly on par with saving a five-year-old kid's life?
It'll save my life.
God, you're easy on me.
Okay.
Then why don't you marry me?
Okay.
Why don't I?
- Don't kid about stuff like that.
- Okay... why don't I?
You know what it is?
Yeah, that thing where you hang together a lot... and sleep in the same room... and button each other's hard-to-reach buttons...
Then I accept.
Really?
Why?
Mr. Larrabee?
David, what a nice surprise.
He's in a meeting.
He's at lunch...
Ron.
Ron.
I need to talk to you.
I'm in a meeting.
When was the last time I came here?
You're right.
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with so much respect.
Something bothering you, David?
You been pushing me into this relationship... so you could engineer a merger with Tyson.
Pushing you?
I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you.
You begged me to make you look good in front of Elizabeth.
You never said a word about making an offer to Patrick...
"Talk about my accomplishments," you said.
"My qualities.
Be creative."
"Lie," you said.
I can't do this, Linus.
I'm not ready to make this kind of commitment.
Oh, I see.
She must have asked for an actual wedding date.
I don't know what came over me.
She was healing children.
I was in a tuxedo.
I'm not in any position to take care of a wife.
Elizabeth is a doctor and a millionaire, David.
She won't be a burden.
You don't deserve her, but she appears to love you.
Doesn't that worry you a little bit?
I mean, about her mental health.
This is all just a coincidence.
- It's an opportunity.
- "Opportunity."
What do you expect me to do?
Disqualify myself from a billion-dollar merger... because I might have family connections?
What are you doing?
It was just a question!
Look at this thing.
Not a scratch.
Is this some new way of changing the subject?
No one in the world has a flat-panel screen this size... except Patrick Tyson, and the damn thing's indestructible.
He's sitting on the hottest technology in town... and everyone on Wall Street knows it.
We've got so much competition on this merger that any advantage...
- You're talking about my life.
- I pay for your life.
My life makes your life possible.
- I resent that.
- So do I.
Look at yourself.
You went to law school.
You never took the bar.
You went to business school.
I can't get you near the office.
You studied languages you don't speak... instruments you don't play.
You have girlfriends you never see more than twice.
Do you see a pattern here?
Who are you to lecture me about closeness?
Your idea of a long-term relationship... is giving your date a chance to order dessert.
I don't have time for dessert.
I'm too busy with this company.
You're a grown man, David.
Finish something.
Elizabeth Tyson's the best thing that ever happened to you... and you told me so yourself.
I would like to propose a toast.
To my baby girl...
Dr. Elizabeth Tyson, talented MD.
And to my future son-in-law, David Larrabee, lucky SOB.
Just kidding, David.
No, we're all very lucky.
Not only is this the joining forever of two gorgeous people... but two gorgeous companies.
Hear, hear.
I want to wish you all the luck and happiness you deserve.
And... may your first child be a masculine child.
It's from Serpico.
Tell Yoshi to bring the Port de Bello.
- You're quite a linguist.
- Yes.
I traveled a lot before I married Patrick.
I was a stewardess.
Now they call them flight attendants.
Oh, really?
I bet I could still get your seat back in the upright position.
Whenever they try to be funny, it comes out perverse... or terrifying.
- I see.
- You'll get used to it.
...to be sure to tell you that she misses you... and sends all of you her love.
But what does she say about the engagement?
You didn't tell her.
I don't know how.
I don't know what to say.
You say, Darling Sabrina...
Your life is a dream, and now it is over.
I know, because we Spaniards...
My dearest Sabrina.
Although I am sure this will come as a shock... it is my belief that what I am about to tell you... is all for the best.
I know how strongly you have always felt about this... and so I have been reluctant to write.
I am in Paris, but you are somewhere else.
I'm sorry, Louis.
I shouldn't have done this.
I would like to help... but what you have to fix, you won't fix it in bed.
You have to fix it here.
Dear Dad.
This is my last letter from Paris.
I may even be home before you get it.
Don't worry about picking me up.
I'd like to surprise you.
Amazing.
It's gone by so quickly.
Gertrude Stein said...
"America is my country, and Paris is my hometown. '"
I'll always feel that way about Paris.
I want so much for you to know what it's meant to me.
It's turned cold out, but I don't feel cold.
Across the street, someone is playing "La Vie En Rose. '"
They do it for the tourists... but I'm always surprised at how it moves me.
It means seeing life through rose-colored glasses.
Only in Paris, where the light is pink... could that song make sense... but I'll have it in my pocket when I get home... and I'll take it with me wherever I go from now on.
Love to you, Dad.
- What are you doing?
- Drove out with Maude.
Have to be here for her birthday party.
- Might as well stay over.
- Yeah?
What'd you get her?
Portable fax machine.
You sentimental fool.
It's easy for you.
She's so glad you finally set a date... you'll never have to buy another present.
That's not what she says.
I got her a little Picasso.
Having it wrapped in town.
- What did that cost me?
- I don't know.
So who's the new bidder on Tyson?
Unisat?
And a couple of other companies.
Cash or stock options?
I love it when you talk dirty.
Come back here!
Excuse me.
- What's that?
- A dog.
- Why?
- It's Elizabeth's gift to Mother.
She feels guilty about missing the party.
She's stuck at some UCLA seminar.
I gotta go pick up Maude's present.
I want you to know something, Linus.
I'm glad about Elizabeth.
You should be.
She's terrific.
She's smart, independent, pretty as hell.
- Why don't you marry her?
- Go on.
I'm kidding.
Kidding.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm great.
How are you?
Good.
I'm just surprised to see you here.
Well, you know me.
Don't you?
Can I give you a lift?
Are you on your way home?
- Yes.
- Well, that's convenient.
You wouldn't mind?
You know, I can't remember the name of your street.
Dusoris Lane.
What?
That's where I live.
- Small world.
- Big lane.
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- Yeah.
Of course I do.
You're my neighbor... on Dusoris Lane.
And you're David.
I sure am.
- One of the lesser Larrabees.
- Oh, in what way lesser?
Pretty much every way, but, please, no pity.
I could have sworn I knew every pretty girl on the north shore.
I could have sworn you took in more territory than that.
- Ouch.
- Although that was a while ago.
I heard somewhere that you're engaged to be married.
Oh, yeah, I am, but we're both... very busy, busy people... and it's been very difficult to set a date.
Give me one clue.
Oh, no.
This is too much fun.
- Please.
- There's your driveway.
I was just gonna say that.
Would you like to come in for a drink?
What a good idea.
Wow.
Looks like you're having a party.
Tomorrow night.
They used to have lovely parties here.
Then you've been to them.
But I saw the lights from a distance.
What's the occasion?
It's too late for an engagement party.
As a matter of fact, my fiancée is in California this week.
It's actually a birthday party for my mother... but you probably knew that.
Listen.
Party's at 9:00.
Will you come?
Do you really want me to?
Very much.
If you'll tell me who you are.
Hello, Sabrina.
Hello, Linus.
Sabrina?
- Have a good time in Paris?
- Yes.
Thank you.
You look all grown up.
Sabrina?
- Why does he keep saying that?
- I need to go find my father.
I'll get my bags later.
- Wait a minute.
- Thanks for the ride.
- What are you talking about?
- No.
I brought you a scarf, Joanna.
A real Paris scarf.
- I'll show you how to tie it.
- Has he seen you?
- Yes!
No.
Who?
- Your father.
Oh, Sabrina!
For going out.
For staying in.
For laughs.
Better than Christmas.
Who took these?
I did.
I hope this hangs out before tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is Mrs. Larrabee's birthday party.
Yes.
I've been invited.
- By whom?
- By David.
Of course, he didn't know it was me when he invited me.
Now that he knows?
I'm still invited, I guess.
Maybe I'll try steaming it.
Dad, please?
I promised myself years ago... all of those years, hundreds of times... thousands of times... and now I'm invited.
Excuse me.
Hello.
You're here.
Yes, I am.
That's true.
You look beautiful.
So do you.
Look good.
Fabulous party, Maude.
I'm so sorry Elizabeth can't be here.
So am I. She gave me a dog.
I can't believe I'm here.
I went to a party once in a villa in Provence.
I didn't know a single person.
Rothschild was there.
Everyone was speaking in French.
I could hardly understand a word.
But I felt more comfortable than I do now.
Here.
Drink this as quickly as possible... and it won't seem so strange to you.
- Whoa.
David.
- Better?
Not yet.
Trust me, it will be.
- Which Rothschild?
- Bubba.
Is that funny?
Did Elizabeth pick out her dress?
We're still doing the guest list.
600 so far.
That's just on our side.
That's not a wedding, it's a town.
Stop.
It's going to be wonderful.
Elegant but simple.
Lavish but tasteful.
Cheap but expensive.
- Hi.
- Where have you been?
$23 a pound.
They'll be gone in five minutes.
Eat fast.
You are a princess.
For you.
- Who's that?
- Who?
That girl.
The one with David.
Oh, well, that's...
That's just...
Oh, my God.
That's Sabrina.
David's known her since she was two years old.
She didn't have that dress when she was two years old.
She's drinking champagne and eating seafood... and her hair is washed and her lips are red... and her teeth are white, and he made a song for her.
I don't like it.
Well, Sabrina.
- When did you get back?
- Yesterday.
Happy birthday, Mrs. Larrabee.
For a minute I didn't recognize you.
- It's the haircut.
- To say the least.
Some surprise, isn't she, Mother?
She certainly is, son.
Dance with me.
Now?
While the music's playing.
It's harder when they stop.
Come on.
Yes?
I've been to every party you've ever had.
Right there, watching from that tree.
Like a bat.
And now here we are, dancing in front of God and everyone.
I should have paid more attention to you.
I don't know what I was thinking of.
Yourself.
It feels so good to hold you.
Does it?
Do you know how beautiful you are?
You're dazzling.
Dazzling?
Suddenly back in my life and dazzling.
Am I back in your life?
I don't think you realize what you've done to me.
Then you better tell me.
You're changing everything.
She's like a sister to him, Patrick.
I have a sister.
That's not how we dance.
It's Sabrina.
Go and see.
I can't believe this is happening.
You're absolutely transformed.
And you're exactly the same.
You were perfect.
You still are.
Yes?
Let's go someplace we can talk.
We are talking.
Someplace else.
Please.
I haven't seen you in years.
I'm not sure I ever saw you.
Come with me.
For a little while.
- We could just go...
- To the solarium?
What?
It has to be the solarium.
And you bring a bottle of champagne... and you put the glasses in the back pockets of your jacket.
I don't think there are any back pockets to my jacket.
You were paying attention.
And the orchestra will play...
"How Can I Remember?"
Yes.
I'll have them do that.
And then afterwards...
I'll wake up.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
See you later.
- You got a minute?
- Not right now, actually.
- I have an appointment.
- Sure you do.
David, what are you doing?
Are you insane?
Right smack dab in front of your prominent... and paranoid future in-laws... you are hustling the chauffeur's daughter!
- We were dancing.
- Stop dancing.
I can't have a drink and a dance with an old friend?
Do I look stupid?
I never thought of myself as stupid, but maybe I am.
- I didn't do anything.
- You were planning to!
- How do you know?
- You're kidding, right?
David, you're like my own son.
I am your own son, Mother.
Exactly!
I endured 21 hours of hard labor to bring you into the world.
The doctors begged me to take drugs... but I kept saying I wouldn't do anything to hurt my child.
Well, I've changed my mind.
You screw up with Elizabeth, and I'll kill you.
I don't know.
There's something about Sabrina.
I think...
I know this sounds crazy... but I think I'm falling in love with her.
- Oh, God!
- Listen, I didn't plan this.
I can't help it.
She's so...
Something.
Sensational.
The last time you found someone sensational... it cost the family a million and a half dollars.
- This time it's different.
- Oh, that's so original.
What about Elizabeth?
You finally find the right girl...
Who's got the right parents who own the right company.
- You asked her to marry you.
- Actually, she asked me.
Mother, go outside and blow out your candles.
Can't we send somebody?
What do you think Sabrina wants?
She's lived her whole life above that garage... with her nose pressed against the glass or in that tree... watching us at parties.
Now you invite her to one.
You're in your Rolex jacket or whatever.
You tell her to meet you in the solarium.
She knows you'll show up with a bottle of champagne.
That has nothing to do with it.
She knows what's coming.
The jet to Martha's Vineyard.
The cottage full of food and flowers.
House seats to some sold-out show.
Drinks at the Carlyle.
A day or two of that, she'd fall for Noriega.
You don't know her or the way she makes me feel.
I can't be engaged to somebody when I feel like this.
- Sit down.
- I can't talk about this now.
Just sit down.
- What?
- I sat on the glasses!
Don't move.
Get Dr. Calloway.
He's at the bar.
- Who put glasses on the chair?
- I'm bleeding.
- Could we talk about this later?
- Oh, my God!
Linus, stay with him.
Darling, don't worry.
Just elevate something.
God.
Bad?
Sabrina.
She's waiting for me.
I'll take care of her.
Hello, Sabrina.
I have a message from David.
He won't be able to make it.
He sent me.
I'm sorry.
You're upset.
Of course.
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
I'm a little tired.
Why didn't he come?
He was on his way.
He had a slight accident.
He sat on a champagne flute.
- Is he okay?
- He's in the emergency room.
Emergency room?
It was a sharp flute.
That's a little joke.
Should I drive over to see him?
He'll be fine.
Couple of stitches.
You can see him tomorrow.
- What's this for?
- Part of the message from David.
They've sent you to deal with me, haven't they?
They?
Like a lawyer in a movie.
He goes to the unsuitable waitress... or showgirl or chauffeur's daughter... and says the family is prepared to offer you $ 100,000... to stay away from their son.
"No," she says. "150,000."
200,000.
No.
A million.
No self-respecting lawyer would offer less.
No self-respecting waitress... would take it.
Good girl.
I've loved him all my life.
Have you?
I thought I was over it.
Surprise, surprise.
You don't object?
Object?
To you?
Look at you.
It's as though a lovely breeze has swept through this whole house.
Even though the breeze... comes from the general direction of the garage?
It's the '90s, Sabrina.
So they say.
How can I remember things that never happened
Arms that never held me
Lips I've never kissed
They played that the night before I left for Paris.
They often do play that.
He was dancing right here with someone.
Yeah.
He often does do that.
And tonight you wanted it to be you.
- I don't know why or when or where
- It's all in the family.
I feel suspended
In the air
Somewhere between the dream and the memory
I never thought of you as a dancer.
Crazy about it.
Call me Bojangles at the office.
In all those years, I never saw you do this... meet a girl here with champagne.
Never did it before.
You never had to before.
Is it impossible to believe that I want to dance... with the prettiest girl at the party?
Thank you.
Yes, it is impossible to believe.
Then you don't know me.
I almost forgot.
The rest of the message from David.
Thanks.
I needed that.
- What am I doing?
- No, I apologize.
No, I should never have...
You have my handprint on your face.
Maybe it's better if you pick up your messages in person.
You'll see David tomorrow.
Good night.
Mack, I'm gonna stay out here for the next two days.
Cancel whatever I've got and reschedule.
Have the plane stand by for 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow morning... and set up the Vineyard cottage.
I don't know.
Flowers, candles, singers.
- Wonderful party, Linus.
- Thank you.
Call David's secretary.
It's the only thing she ever does.
Why not?
Hell, I'm up.
You're up.
You weren't?
Well, call her anyway.
Thank you very much for coming.
Good to see you.
Good night.
Jesus.
A dog.
What is there, an epidemic of sleeping sickness?
Okay, listen.
David can't stand pain, so I want you to give him a combination... of morphine and...
I don't...
Okay, not morphine, but something strong... and mixed with a sleeping tablet like Halcion.
They haven't proved that, Frank.
We have no idea.
Maude thinks they were left on the chair by some guest.
He's not gonna sue his own mother.
Well, he's not me.
Wait, you're not going to work that way, are you?
- Give us a moment?
- Sure, Mr. Larrabee.
Tyson say anything after I left last night?
He wondered where everybody had gone.
Maybe I should talk to Sabrina.
And say what?
"Sabrina, you're very lovely... but David has a short attention span.
He's just jerking your chain."
Can I say that to a woman?
"Jerking your chain"?
- When's Elizabeth due back?
- Thursday.
Should we try to get her back sooner?
I don't want him trying to break off the engagement.
This all happened in 24 hours.
I can make it unhappen in 48.
I like Sabrina.
I always have.
But I'm not about to kiss off a billion dollars.
I don't care what she did to her hair.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'll take you up to see David.
Thank you.
Can he hear me?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did the dry cleaners have your car?
- How do you feel?
- I didn't get there.
Did I?
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Am I in a lot of pain?
Look at your little hand.
Guess what happened to me.
I know.
I know.
I feel awful.
Me too.
How do you feel, Linus?
You're falling a little behind here, David.
Do you want me to stay with you?
Listen.
We got you a terrific nurse and a two-day supply of red Jell-O.
He really should rest.
- Isn't Mr. Linus going in?
- He has other work today.
Oh, very good, madame.
I'm sure he'll be more responsive next time.
Don't worry.
See you.
Thank you.
You know...
I was wondering.
We have this summer cottage on the Vineyard we never use.
I want to put it on the market.
I was going to have a few pictures taken... the kind that make it look bigger than it is.
I understand you have an interest in photography.
I thought you might like to take them.
Trip would be no trouble.
Helicopter could pick us up here.
Plane's at Republic.
Is that a lot to ask?
Saves all that time fighting traffic.
And all those tollbooths.
- No, thanks.
- Something to drink, Miss Fairchild?
- Sabrina.
- What a beautiful name.
- Carol.
- Sorry.
Can I get you something...
Pellegrino.
Same.
Mack, anything from Granger?
Anybody else at SEC?
No, tell him I'll call him back as soon as I can.
So that really is a beautiful name.
How did you get it?
My father's reading.
It's in a poem.
"Sabrina fair, listen where thou art sitting... under the glassy, cool, translucent wave... in twisted braids of lilies knitting the loose train... of thy amber-dropping hair."
- Amber-dropping hair.
That's...
- Carol.
I'm sorry.
It's an incredible airplane.
It's beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.
Ah, yes.
Don't you ever look out the window?
When do I have time?
What happened to all that time we saved taking the helicopter?
I'm storing it up.
No, you're not.
So your little poem...
what does it mean?
It's the story of a water sprite... who saved a virgin from a fate worse than death.
- Sabrina's the virgin.
- Sabrina's the savior.
Is it always like this?
I don't know.
I haven't been here in years.
How can you have a place like this and never come here?
Gee, I don't know.
I guess I...
I just never had anybody to share it with.
I guess.
You could always hire somebody.
No, wait, not me.
The house, please.
You're in the house.
It humanizes it.
I don't like having my picture taken.
I come out...
Looking depressed.
Are you depressed?
Maybe that's not exactly the right word.
What is the right word?
I don't know.
Lonely, maybe.
- That would be the oboe.
- The oboe?
It was a misunderstanding.
He thought he was gonna get to take hobo lessons.
It was a rainy afternoon?
Stormy.
I was afraid, and I came into your house... and tried to turn on a lamp, but I got a shock.
I thought I'd been struck by lightning.
And you stayed with me all afternoon... till my father came home.
And you didn't cry.
You were a brave kid.
I was more afraid of you than being electrocuted.
Everybody was.
Is that the reason you never got married?
You probably don't believe in marriage.
Yes, I do.
That's why I never got married.
David, on the other hand, believes in the tooth fairy.
- That's why I like him.
- Well, I like him too.
Matter of fact, I love him.
I don't know what to do with him.
When he was a kid, he used to love to come into the office.
He'd sit behind my father's desk and write memos.
Then he'd read the ticker tape.
One day, he just stopped.
I can't figure out...
Are those the only things people say about me?
It was a nice day.
You were a little tough on me, I thought.
I guess you're used to being treated very carefully.
- When will you have the pictures?
- Tomorrow.
Could you drop them by the office?
Sure.
Well, good night, then, Sabrina fair.
Yeah?
My father once asked David... why he stopped coming to the office.
And David said, "What do they need me for?
Linus is there."
Listen, I do real work in the real world.
David watches from the north shore.
I know you work in the real world, and you're awfully good at it.
I'll bet you haven't made a wrong move since you were three.
But that's work.
Where do you live, Linus?
It was a nice day.
Thanks.
It's open.
- Where were you?
In town?
- On Martha's Vineyard.
Linus wanted me to take some pictures.
Linus did?
I love so many things about you, Dad.
But you know what I love best of all?
You became a chauffeur because you wanted to have time to read.
All my life, I've pictured you... sitting in the front seat of a long succession of cars... waiting for the Larrabees and reading.
We had baked clams.
Linus baked them.
I used to be so afraid of him.
It's appropriate.
- What was he like as a child?
- Shorter.
I look out the window... and I see someone, and it is a young woman.
So I say, "What is a young woman doing in the courtyard... at this time of night?"
So I am looking and looking, and I see Sabrina.
She's talking.
Who is she talking to?
A man.
Not her daddy, because he's not as tall.
It was Linus.
Sabrina went out with Linus.
- It was Mr. Linus.
- Sabrina went out with Linus?
- That's too weird.
- I thought the guy was gay.
- Mr. Linus is not a gay.
- It's not "a gay." It's just gay.
Linus Larrabee is gay?
That makes me like him better.
Linus Larrabee is a heterosexual.
- He's still sleeping.
- Oh, is that normal?
When you're taking what he's taking, it is.
He wakes up from time to time.
- Has he asked for anyone?
- Bert and Ernie.
Could you tell him Sabrina was here?
I could tell him the pope was here, but it wouldn't make a dent.
I have to go into the city, but I'll be back by 7:00.
Could you tell him?
Quarterly reports from Publishing will be on-line at 4.00.
International wants a teleconference at 5:15.
Harvey called.
You know that old brick building that we own out at the Vineyard?
Yes.
You ever heard me referred to as the world's only living heart donor?
Have the Rons find out if there's any tax advantage... to donating that building to the town out there.
- If there isn't?
- Then forget it.
Oh, and I want two tickets tonight... for whatever Broadway show nobody can get tickets for.
And a table at the Carlyle for drinks.
- For whom?
- Me.
I know.
I seldom go to the theater.
- Seldom?
- I'm not a theater buff.
Buff?
The most difficult tickets will be for a Broadway musical.
Okay.
That means that the actors, periodically... will dance about and burst into song.
Forget the thing about the tax advantage.
Tell the Rons I want that building donated to the town.
And I want it used as a halfway house.
Sabrina Fairchild.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
Wow.
It's big.
This is where I do that real work in the real world... instead of living.
You remembered.
Doesn't come up every day.
Would you like some coffee?
No, thanks.
Some of these are very good.
- Don't sound so surprised.
- I'm not.
This is an unusual view of the house.
Well... you said you wanted it to look bigger.
Sorry.
No, you have...
Here.
You've got to admit, it's beautiful.
I probably would... if you'd let me.
I found myself in Paris.
A friend said that.
- You were missing?
- Yes.
I once was lost and now am found.
- You're making fun.
- It's my turn.
- You're very photogenic.
- That's 'cause I'm handsome.
No, that's not it.
But not as handsome as David.
Nobody's as handsome as David... even David.
Don't tell him that till he's fully recovered.
Are you sure I can't get you anything?
Cafe au lait, snails, French fries?
- Theater tickets?
- Theater tickets?
I thought I'd take my first step towards...
What is all that French stuff?
The good life?
Knowing when to quit?
Maybe it's a bad idea.
No, it's a good idea.
It was my favorite food in France.
There's this little place in Pigal.
I ate there at least twice a week.
It's good.
Enjoy.
It's really so much better if you eat with your hands.
- Do you mind?
- No.
Not since I made that contribution to the NYU burn unit.
It's good.
Very good.
It's interesting.
Have to try it with soup sometime.
I used to walk everywhere in Paris.
I used to walk from Montmartre to the center of the town.
Along the Seine, there's a four-mile walk... that goes from Isle Saint Germain to the Pont d'Austerlitz.
It takes you past all the bridges of Paris... twenty-three of them.
And you find one you love and go there every day... with your coffee and your journal... and you listen to the river.
What does it tell you?
That's between you and the river.
It's funny.
Listening to you talk makes me... makes me wonder if I should...
- What?
- I don't know.
Something's different.
I feel different.
At work, I don't...
I love the action... but... sometimes I wonder...
lately, especially... been wondering... what it would be like... to spend some time in a place that I love like that... and not just a few days... but for a real change.
Actually, I think I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I just...
I just didn't know it until...
- you...
- What exactly are you saying?
I'm not sure.
I do what my dad did.
He did what his dad did.
My whole life, I've been...
I never chose.
The past gets deeper, more familiar.
- But...
- You're not thinking about Paris.
No, you're probably right.
How could I be?
Am I a lost cause, then?
I don't like to think of anyone as a lost cause.
What time is it?
9:45.
I forgot.
I told the nurse to tell David I'd look in on him.
He's probably sleeping.
- We can go.
- No, you're right.
I can...
Come on.
Let's walk a little.
Was there anything you didn't like about Paris?
How expensive everything is.
Well, I'd have to learn how to say, "I'm just looking."
How do you say, "This is what I want"?
How do you say...
"I'm looking at what I want"?
I don't remember.
I brought you some tea... and I brought you some flowers to brighten up your room.
Have you been watching Remains of the Day again?
She can handle herself with him, you know.
She's not a little girl anymore.
It's just she seems...
I don't know...
displaced right now.
She doesn't belong in a mansion.
She doesn't belong above the garage.
Most people live in between.
Have your tea and try to sleep.
- Hi.
- David.
- How are you feeling?
- Great.
Just felt like getting out of bed for a while.
- Mack says you went to the theater?
- Just dinner.
Moroccan, on the floor.
Lots of cinnamon.
- What's the word from Calloway?
- I'm healing fast.
I just can't eat on the floor yet.
It was good.
Thanks.
You heading back to the city?
No, it's getting kind of late.
I think I'll sleep out here.
Good night.
Good night, Linus.
Thanks.
So... you.
I've been thinking about you.
Have you?
What were you thinking?
I think we never had that drink in the solarium.
We never did.
You sent Linus.
Are you sure you should be walking around?
David, what's going to happen?
I could scare us up some champagne, couple of Dixie cups.
I'm through with glasses.
We could hobble down to the solarium and pick right back up...
- I meant after that.
- After that?
Well, shucks.
Whatever.
I don't know.
Don't you?
Well, not exactly.
Is that so bad?
We can talk about all that later, can't we?
Yes.
But tomorrow.
I really think you should rest now.
Good night, David.
- Good morning, sir.
- How was the theater?
- Come in, Mack.
- That bad, huh?
I want you to get me two tickets on Air France to Paris.
One in my name, and one in the name of Sabrina Fairchild.
That's it.
- What day are we flying?
- Tomorrow.
Oh, I almost forgot.
The Tysons are here waiting.
- Did we have an appointment?
- It's not in my book.
They showed up.
I put them in David's office.
Is my mother in yet?
I got the same thing with a nephew.
I gave him a huge office.
He's never there either, so we use it for lunches.
These are the invitations.
We thought we'd use recycled paper.
- Why does it always look dirty?
- Oh, Maude.
Now, which do you like, the taupe or the buff?
- What's the problem, Patrick?
- No problem from our point of view.
I feel like a...
what's that word?
- When a lot of guys are after you.
- Whore.
I was thinking more "debutante."
Somebody else wants to be in bed with Tyson Electronics.
- You know Intermedia?
- Mm-hmm.
Impressive proposal.
Cash, stock... and they don't want to tell me how to run the business.
Well, how flattering for you, Patrick.
How did you leave it?
I told them we're practically family, you and I.
I couldn't possibly entertain their offer at this time.
Good.
But Elizabeth came home last night.
She called David.
- We got the impression...
- You.
You got the impression.
I got the impression that he wasn't as anxious as he should be... to see her.
But he's not himself, Patrick.
He's been injured.
He's on very heavy medication.
He wants to be perfect before he sees her again.
That's what I thought.
Good morning.
Listen, would you mind another trip into the city?
I've got some business that I'd like to discuss with you.
- Business?
- Yeah.
I was wondering if you could meet me here this afternoon.
I don't know.
There's something I ought to do.
It would mean a great deal to me if you could.
That little leprechaun was making a veiled threat.
There was no veil.
Should we do something?
It's under control.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
What?
It's a long story.
- I like long stories.
- You won't like this one.
Try me.
Things have been progressing with Sabrina.
We've bonded.
We've been confiding in each other.
Last night, over a handful of chicken...
I told her I thought my life was in need of some radical changes.
I told her I was thinking about getting away... moving to Paris.
She thought that was a great idea.
- And she believed you?
- More than that.
I think she'll want to go with me.
How do you know?
The same way I knew fiber optics would replace coaxial cable... that Intel's chip would change the industry... that Cindy Crawford's House of Style would be a big hit.
I just know.
So here's the way it'll play out.
Sabrina will go to Paris with me.
A wiser David will return to Elizabeth.
I'll come back from Paris to sign the papers.
The merger will close.
We'll make a very large sum of money... and you can buy a house in Tuscany.
I have a house in Tuscany.
What happens to Sabrina?
She grows up.
You're going to ditch her?
My goodness.
How did you think this was going to happen, Mother?
Did you think there was some sweet way to do it?
I don't know what I thought.
- I just don't want Sabrina to be...
- What?
Unhappy?
In all these years, you've never once seen the face of somebody... the day after we've taken over their business.
You're at the hairdresser or celebrating.
I think I'm getting old.
I feel terrible.
Take a pill.
Watch it.
I'm still your mother.
And you taught me everything I know.
I didn't teach you this.
Excuse me.
I have some calls to return.
Closer together
Now
Miss Fairchild.
He was expecting you much earlier.
I'll let him know that you're here.
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Don't tell him I'm here.
But he pays me to tell him.
Sabrina Fairchild.
I was beginning to worry.
Why?
That's a favorite question of yours.
Didn't you want to come?
I asked you first.
I asked you second.
I've been...
I've been wandering around Manhattan all afternoon.
It's something to do... with maybe... never seeing you again.
That's ridiculous, because we don't... we don't have to...
Well, except by accident, and...
How could that be a problem?
If two people...
I asked you first.
Well... what you said...
whatever it is... makes what I was gonna say... obsolete, I think.
Obsolete?
Irrelevant.
Okay.
I like irrelevant.
Do you?
Who cuts your hair?
Tony.
Tony?
Yeah.
Why?
You think I should go to your barber?
- No, but...
- Tony was my dad's barber.
He's 94.
Maybe his hand's not as steady as it... as it used to be.
It's just that it's all...
So what's irrelevant?
I want you to come to Paris.
- You mean go to Paris.
- I want you to come to Paris... with me.
You're really going?
It's your fault.
You convinced me that there were some things missing in my life.
Like what?
Like a life.
- I didn't think you were listening.
- I was.
Will you come?
Don't say no.
Will you?
- I just got back.
- So?
Say yes now.
- We can leave tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- I have to talk to David.
- Just come away.
He'll get the idea in a week or two.
You are formidable, aren't you?
- In business dealings...
- This isn't business.
Didn't you once say everything is business?
No, but it sounds like me.
What will you tell him?
I did knock.
Here are the tickets.
And the other things are being taken care of.
And good night.
So it is.
You want dinner?
I could order in.
I don't understand what happened.
- I hardly know you.
- Oh, yes, you do.
I wasn't even interested.
Gee, thanks.
I was interested in David.
He was so much what I wanted that I had to escape... and I did, to Paris.
And I wrote in my stupid journal and I cut my stupid hair... and I came back stupider than ever.
I'm so happy.
You've made me so happy.
I can't do this.
What is it?
- You were right.
- About what?
About everything.
Everything that mattered.
It was all a lie... everything I said to you... from the moment I brought the champagne into the solarium.
I don't believe you.
I was sent to deal with you.
I sent myself.
And I did a hell of a job.
There was a marriage.
There was a merger.
You got in the way.
The plan was to take you to Paris... then leave... to get you out of the way.
I think there's no other...
What other things are being taken care of?
What?
She said, "other things."
An apartment for you in Paris... and a bank account.
How much?
500,000 francs.
Your first offer was better.
You can have more.
I don't want more.
I don't want any.
You went to all that trouble just for me?
The helicopter and the jet...
It was no trouble.
Was I really so bad for David, so wrong?
The chauffeur's daughter.
Isn't that all over?
That's not it.
It's about a piece of plastic.
- Plastic?
- Nothing personal.
May I?
Paris is always a good idea.
I was happy there.
You would've been too.
I'll drive you home.
I'm flying home.
He shall have music wherever he goes.
You're better.
Oh, yeah.
Much better.
Stitches come out tomorrow.
How 'bout you?
- Where you coming from?
- Town.
Long evening.
I thought we were gonna talk.
I was planning a big stitch-removal celebration.
- I thought we'd go down to...
- I was with Linus.
You know, of all the girls I've known... and I've known some...
Is that a song?
You're the only girl I danced with only once.
Twice.
What?
How could I have forgotten?
Was there champagne?
I was eight... and you were taking dancing lessons... and I was homework.
I'm leaving town, David.
I think I knew that.
I won a ticket to Paris.
Lucky.
- One way?
- Yes, come to think of it.
Traveling alone?
Yes.
You have a good trip.
- You're here.
- So are you.
Call Seattle and Tokyo.
Tell them to stop construction.
Then get the Rons and Tysons, and tell them... there's an emergency meeting on the merger here at noon.
Take this Paris ticket in my name and transfer it to David Larrabee.
I need to see my mother...
I need to see my mother as soon as she gets in.
Good morning, David.
Can I get you some coffee?
No?
Okay.
I got a surprise for you.
Yeah?
I got one for you too.
I've watched you do business for years... but I thought there was a limit to how sick you could...
How could you, Linus?
How could you do what you did to me and to her?
How could you go that far?
What the hell makes you think you have the right?
Habit.
Listen, David.
I tried something, and it didn't work.
I mean, it worked, but it didn't really work.
I want you to go to Paris today... with Sabrina.
- What?
- This was a business tactic.
But it got out of hand.
Somehow I lost my focus.
I screwed up everything... but I know it can be fixed.
I manipulated her...
I confused her... but she's loved you all her life.
You're what she really wants.
You're what she's always wanted.
Go with her.
It's not too late.
Things will work out.
She'll make you happy.
I don't want her to have to leave here alone.
What about Patrick and the merger?
You'd blow a billion dollars for this?
I see.
Get going.
Go on.
Don't miss the plane.
Miss McCartle, I want to see you in my office right away.
Where is it?
When your mother and I first came here... she cooked, I drove, and we had no expenses.
After a couple of years, we had $ 15,000.
I was driving Mr. Larrabee, Senior, at the time.
He never closed the window between us.
He transacted a lot of business on the daily commute... and I paid attention.
When he bought, I bought.
When he sold, I sold.
Dad, are you telling me you have a million dollars?
A little over two million.
Your mother and I were happy here, Sabrina.
We always dreamed of what it would be like to do this for you.
Two million dollars might have exceeded our expectations.
But then, you've always exceeded mine.
I know what his instructions were, but it's a mistake.
I'm giving you new instructions.
There's been a change.
Just get started.
I'll call you back.
Thanks for getting here so quickly.
I need to tell you a story.
And I need for you to tell me... how it's gonna turn out.
All those years... you made all that money... and you never told any of us how to do it.
I'll tell you now, Joanna.
Marry me for my money.
People do it every day.
I'm not amused, Thomas... and I have a great sense of humor.
Then marry me for love.
Emergency what?
What's the emergency?
Darling, if I knew.
I'm sure there's a perfectly good answer to that question.
I've got my dress.
It looks fabulous.
- What the hell is going on?
- In a minute, Patrick.
What are we waiting for?
- What's with Siegfried and Roy?
- Just a minute, Patrick.
We've known each other for a long time.
We may have played hardball on occasion, but...
I think we have a healthy respect for... our individual business abilities.
We saw the potential of this merger, and I don't think anybody doubts... it would have been an enormously successful venture.
Would have been?
The purpose of this meeting is to inform you that my brother David...
Is late, as usual.
Sorry.
- Sorry, everybody.
- What are you doing here?
Elizabeth and I have decided to elope.
Really?
- David, where's Sabrina?
- So are we merging?
Who's Sabrina?
- You didn't go with her?
- Obviously not.
Here I am, right?
She's probably having her beverage service right about now.
- Who is?
- Sabrina.
- Who's Sabrina?
- The chauffeur's daughter.
- Don't call her that.
- She was after David for a while.
Then, apparently, she switched to Linus.
She seems to have decided that he was the one with the power.
- Is that what he told you?
- He told me everything, Linus.
You didn't see her before she left?
You didn't talk to her?
Sure.
I said good-bye.
I think I wished her luck.
Maybe not.
I told her I felt funny accepting my brother's hand-me-downs... and I said don't take it personally... and that you've always been very generous to your women in the past.
I was sure she'd be more than compensated for whatever.
- I told you!
He loves her.
- Who?
- Is he packed?
- Yes.
- Is who packed?
- You are.
Just one bag.
Wait.
You packed my clothes?
You went to my apartment?
- I took her.
- We were in your underwear drawer.
It was like touching the Shroud of Turin.
Sign this.
It's your authorization for the completion of the merger.
And this.
Gives me the raise I deserve for the new position I'm assuming.
There's a car waiting for you downstairs... a helicopter at East 60th.
The plane ticket's been changed to the Concorde.
It leaves in exactly 39 minutes.
You just might beat her there.
Go, Linus.
Don't think.
- She must absolutely hate me.
- She'll get over it.
We all do.
This is crazy.
You expect me to just drop everything and walk out of here?
- Running would be better.
- I think you're all nuts.
Linus, you know I love you.
No mother could be prouder.
But I think it's time that you ran away from home.
But sign these first.
If you'll excuse me... it appears I have a previous engagement.
Now, Patrick, the debt burden this merger will accumulate... is gonna make it essential to restructure a couple of divisions... that are generating cash drains.
I've done a very quick review of last quarter's performance... of each division of both companies.
When did you ever...
You've copied me on the company's financial statements for 17 years.
You just assumed I couldn't read.
Go ahead.
Say it.
You don't deserve her.
I don't.
I know that.
But I need her, and I don't need anything.
Time to run for it.
I just want to make her happy.
13 Rue des Beaux Arts.
Your attention, please.
Last call for Air France Concorde supersonic flight to Paris... now boarding at gate 34.
Air France wishes you a pleasant flight.
First time on the Concorde, Mr. Larrabee?
Yes.
But not your first time in Paris?
It's my first everything.
"Paris is always a good idea," you said.
You said I'd be happy here.
You couldn't have meant without you.
How did you know where to find me?
Your father.
I told him I need you.
I told him I'd make you happy.
I promised him.
I thought it was all a lie.
So did I.
But something happened.
It was a lie... and then it was a dream.
I don't know how to believe you.
- How can I ever...
- Because you know me... better than anyone else.
I think you know I love you... and you promised... if there was anything you could ever do...
Once upon a time... on the north shore of Long Island... not far from New York... there was a very, very large mansion... almost a castle.
I've been following in footsteps all my life.
Save me, Sabrina fair.
You're the only one who can.
On this very large estate, there lived a small girl... and life was pleasant there... and very, very simple.
But then one day... the girl grew up... and went beyond the walls of the grounds... and found the world.
{{{the end}}}
Once upon a time... on the north shore of Long Island... not far from New York... there was a very, very large mansion.... almost a castle... where there lived a family by the name of Larrabee.
There were servants inside the mansion... and servants outside the mansion.
Boatmen to tend the boats... and six crews of gardeners... two for the solarium... the rest for the grounds... and a tree surgeon on retainer.
There were specialists for the indoor tennis courts... and the outdoor tennis courts... the outdoor swimming pool and the indoor swimming pool.
And over the garage... there lived a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild... imported from England years ago... together with a Rolls-Royce... and a daughter named Sabrina.
In the moonlight
When the shadows play
When the thought of what could happen
Takes your breath away
Sighs and whispers
Quiet laughter in the air
Can make it seem that love is everywhere
Among other things... the Larrabees were noted for the parties they gave.
Few people anymore give parties the way they did.
It never rained on the night of a Larrabee party.
The Larrabees wouldn't have stood for it.
In the half-light Can we trust...
There was Maude Larrabee... who inherited the Larrabee Corporation... when her husband died on the 13th hole at Pebble Beach.
Sweetheart, go talk to Colonel Morgan.
He looks bored.
Senator!
Have I got somebody I want you to meet.
Maude was on the cover of Fortune.
There was Linus, the older son... who graduated from Yale at 19... and took his mother and the company for a ride... on the fiber-optic highway... and turned a hundred-million-dollar family business... into some serious money.
I just don't feel like buying any more networks this year.
There's never anything good on.
I said the offer expired at 10:00.
It's 10:08, Robert.
Linus was on the cover of Time.
But most of all... there was David... the younger son... who was in and out of many schools and even more relationships.
He was handsome and charming and funny and romantic.
It's so rare to meet such a beautiful woman... with your sense of humor and irony... poetry... and hair color.
David did a Gap ad.
Sabrina?
Sabrina, come down.
She made him laugh.
- You have to finish packing.
- Am I witty?
I wonder if Paris is far away enough.
No, really.
Do you think I'm funny?
Hilarious.
You should host a talk show.
Sabrina, the full-time observation of David Larrabee... is not a recognized profession.
Get out of that tree.
In a minute.
It's just you, Sabrina.
Hello, David.
I thought I heard somebody.
No, it's nobody.
How can I remember things that never happened
Arms that never held me
Lips I've never kissed
How can I remember
Why do I keep seeing
Someone's face before me
Eyes that say they know me
Shining through the mist
Eyes that I remember
I don't know why
Or when or where
Sabrina?
You've spent more of your life up that tree... than you have on solid ground.
You know how lucky we are that Mrs. Larrabee... has friends who have a job for you... so you can have this European experience?
The time in Paris will be so good for you.
If your mother were alive, she'd be so happy.
- It's what she always wanted.
- What if he forgets all about me?
How can he forget someone he doesn't know exists?
I didn't mean that.
I just meant... there's much more to you than this obsession.
I hope you know that.
Thanks, Dad.
Good night.
How can I remember things
That never happened
Arms that never held me
Lips I've never kissed
I need more help.
Where you going?
It's early.
It'll take me half an hour to get out of here.
I gotta check on the Tokyo market before it closes.
Good night.
Linus, Andrea Colson told me you just fired her son.
He's an idiot.
But she was a bridesmaid at my wedding.
- She's one of my best friends.
- This is business, Mother.
Listen, I gotta drop something off in David's room.
When he surfaces from this week's love of his life... tell him I put his suspenders back in his closet.
You're not leaving now.
You'll miss my fireworks.
It's okay, Mother.
I had a pony ride and I got my face painted.
Good night.
Come in.
I came to say good-bye.
- What?
- Don't come out.
If I look at you, I might not be able to get through this.
Please don't say anything.
I'm leaving tomorrow for Paris... and I'll be away a long time.
I don't expect you to think about me while I'm gone.
You haven't thought about me while I was here.
I just want to say...
I think I know you better than anybody else.
I mean, whatever they think or say, I know the truth... that you're a wonderful person... kind and generous and... and, for what it's worth, know that someone... very far away is thinking of you.
So, if there's anything I can ever do.
Could you bring me one of those little Eiffel Tower paperweights?
Oh, my God!
Welcome to Vogue, Sabrina.
You speak no French, yes?
- No.
- No?
I mean, yes, I don't.
Sorry.
Please, could you repeat the question?
We have many shoes, you see.
Very important.
You know, I speak very good the English.
You pull, then close the plate.
Goes to shoot.
Most important...
Belt.
Ingrid, hurry up.
I'm putting in my contacts.
Another one.
Another one.
The nice one.
Don't worry for Martine.
I tortured her.
Now she tortures you.
Succeed, you'll get someone of your own to torture.
But you've only been there for two weeks.
I doubt every single person in Paris thinks you're an idiot.
Only because I haven't met them all.
Sabrina, you're being much too hard on yourself.
Give it a chance.
Now what matters is you're away from here... experiencing new things... getting another view of the world, finding new friends.
And not constantly thinking about you know who!
Morning, Tom.
She's fine.
She hasn't adjusted completely.
- She's miserable.
I knew it.
- I told you not to send her.
Mr. Tom, maybe this not for me to put my hands in this... but when I first come to this country, I am alone... like Sabrina.
I just weigh more.
So, I ask to God, "Why I am here?"
I say, "Why, God?"
But there is no answer.
So I stop crying.
It takes 11 years!
Thank you, Rosa.
- Did she mention David?
- Just that life without him... is a "hopeless abyss of misery and despair."
I believe those were her words.
Raise your leg.
Yes.
Ooh, yeah.
Have a drink with me.
- Fairchild.
- Good morning, sir.
Hey, Linus!
Got a minute?
David, does it ever occur to you... that you're an officer of the Larrabee Corporation?
I met someone.
Do you recall the address of our building?
It's 389 Park Avenue.
- I'm not kidding.
- Your office is on the 48th floor.
- This is really somebody.
- So what's the problem?
I've invited her for dinner here Friday... and I don't want you and Mother to...
This girl is smart.
She's really smart.
That certainly hasn't come up before.
Listen, Linus, she's a real woman.
- She's not a, you know...
- Transvestite?
She's not a bimbo.
She's a doctor.
- Pediatrician, actually.
- How did you meet her?
I was at this party, and the host's kid got sick with something.
I rushed him over to Lennox Hill Emergency... and she was the resident on duty, and we just hit it right off.
How'd the sick kid make out?
When you guys meet her, just try to make me look good.
I know I look good, but try to make me sound good.
Mention my accomplishments.
My qualities.
You can be creative.
Lie, okay?
She says her folks know you.
- What's her name?
- Elizabeth Tyson.
Tyson Electronics Tyson?
- Tyson I don't know Tyson.
- Here's a toughie.
Which one works for a living?
Wow, great hat, Mother.
Good morning, blue eyes.
Bring her around.
We'll try and make you look good.
You guys work Sundays now?
It's Wednesday, David.
Guess what.
David's taking out Patrick Tyson's daughter.
- Well, well, well.
- Yes, sir?
Mack, give me Harvey.
Harvey, I want you to start buying up chunks of Tyson stock.
Not so much that anybody would notice.
That's it.
I hope she doesn't look like Patrick.
For once your father didn't lie.
- You are lovely.
- Thank you.
- I'm Maude.
- Pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you from my father.
- And you're really a doctor?
- No, he made that up.
She was just promoted to assistant head of pediatrics... and I told her the hospital can count on us... for a couple million dollars.
Is he a world-class philanthropist, or what?
Just squeeze.
I like Louis.
He's funny and sweet and such a good photographer.
But someone is in the way.
Is it this David you mentioned casually... 40 or 50 times when you first came over?
He sounds, perhaps, like an illusion.
He keeps me company.
You think so?
Illusions are dangerous people.
They have no flaws.
I came here from Provence... alone, uneducated.
For eight months...
no, more than that... a year...
I sat in a cafe, I drank coffee... and I wrote nonsense in a journal.
And then, somehow... it was not nonsense.
I went for long walks... and I met myself in Paris.
You seem embarrassed by loneliness... by being alone.
It's only a place to start.
- I'm sorry about your party.
- It's okay.
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll draw you a hot bath, whip us up a superb omelet.
Do you have eggs, cheese, green pepper, tomato?
No green pepper.
No tomato.
Oh, well, then I'll just whip us up... a somewhat superb omelet.
David, you are the best.
You mean, making a hot bath and an omelet are... roughly on par with saving a five-year-old kid's life?
It'll save my life.
God, you're easy on me.
Okay.
Then why don't you marry me?
Okay.
Why don't I?
- Don't kid about stuff like that.
- Okay... why don't I?
You know what it is?
Yeah, that thing where you hang together a lot... and sleep in the same room... and button each other's hard-to-reach buttons...
Then I accept.
Really?
Why?
Mr. Larrabee?
David, what a nice surprise.
He's in a meeting.
He's at lunch...
Ron.
Ron.
I need to talk to you.
I'm in a meeting.
When was the last time I came here?
You're right.
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with so much respect.
Something bothering you, David?
You been pushing me into this relationship... so you could engineer a merger with Tyson.
Pushing you?
I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you.
You begged me to make you look good in front of Elizabeth.
You never said a word about making an offer to Patrick...
"Talk about my accomplishments," you said.
"My qualities.
Be creative."
"Lie," you said.
I can't do this, Linus.
I'm not ready to make this kind of commitment.
Oh, I see.
She must have asked for an actual wedding date.
I don't know what came over me.
She was healing children.
I was in a tuxedo.
I'm not in any position to take care of a wife.
Elizabeth is a doctor and a millionaire, David.
She won't be a burden.
You don't deserve her, but she appears to love you.
Doesn't that worry you a little bit?
I mean, about her mental health.
This is all just a coincidence.
- It's an opportunity.
- "Opportunity."
What do you expect me to do?
Disqualify myself from a billion-dollar merger... because I might have family connections?
What are you doing?
It was just a question!
Look at this thing.
Not a scratch.
Is this some new way of changing the subject?
No one in the world has a flat-panel screen this size... except Patrick Tyson, and the damn thing's indestructible.
He's sitting on the hottest technology in town... and everyone on Wall Street knows it.
We've got so much competition on this merger that any advantage...
- You're talking about my life.
- I pay for your life.
My life makes your life possible.
- I resent that.
- So do I.
Look at yourself.
You went to law school.
You never took the bar.
You went to business school.
I can't get you near the office.
You studied languages you don't speak... instruments you don't play.
You have girlfriends you never see more than twice.
Do you see a pattern here?
Who are you to lecture me about closeness?
Your idea of a long-term relationship... is giving your date a chance to order dessert.
I don't have time for dessert.
I'm too busy with this company.
You're a grown man, David.
Finish something.
Elizabeth Tyson's the best thing that ever happened to you... and you told me so yourself.
I would like to propose a toast.
To my baby girl...
Dr. Elizabeth Tyson, talented MD.
And to my future son-in-law, David Larrabee, lucky SOB.
Just kidding, David.
No, we're all very lucky.
Not only is this the joining forever of two gorgeous people... but two gorgeous companies.
Hear, hear.
I want to wish you all the luck and happiness you deserve.
And... may your first child be a masculine child.
It's from Serpico.
Tell Yoshi to bring the Port de Bello.
- You're quite a linguist.
- Yes.
I traveled a lot before I married Patrick.
I was a stewardess.
Now they call them flight attendants.
Oh, really?
I bet I could still get your seat back in the upright position.
Whenever they try to be funny, it comes out perverse... or terrifying.
- I see.
- You'll get used to it.
...to be sure to tell you that she misses you... and sends all of you her love.
But what does she say about the engagement?
You didn't tell her.
I don't know how.
I don't know what to say.
You say, Darling Sabrina...
Your life is a dream, and now it is over.
I know, because we Spaniards...
My dearest Sabrina.
Although I am sure this will come as a shock... it is my belief that what I am about to tell you... is all for the best.
I know how strongly you have always felt about this... and so I have been reluctant to write.
I am in Paris, but you are somewhere else.
I'm sorry, Louis.
I shouldn't have done this.
I would like to help... but what you have to fix, you won't fix it in bed.
You have to fix it here.
Dear Dad.
This is my last letter from Paris.
I may even be home before you get it.
Don't worry about picking me up.
I'd like to surprise you.
Amazing.
It's gone by so quickly.
Gertrude Stein said...
"America is my country, and Paris is my hometown. '"
I'll always feel that way about Paris.
I want so much for you to know what it's meant to me.
It's turned cold out, but I don't feel cold.
Across the street, someone is playing "La Vie En Rose. '"
They do it for the tourists... but I'm always surprised at how it moves me.
It means seeing life through rose-colored glasses.
Only in Paris, where the light is pink... could that song make sense... but I'll have it in my pocket when I get home... and I'll take it with me wherever I go from now on.
Love to you, Dad.
- What are you doing?
- Drove out with Maude.
Have to be here for her birthday party.
- Might as well stay over.
- Yeah?
What'd you get her?
Portable fax machine.
You sentimental fool.
It's easy for you.
She's so glad you finally set a date... you'll never have to buy another present.
That's not what she says.
I got her a little Picasso.
Having it wrapped in town.
- What did that cost me?
- I don't know.
So who's the new bidder on Tyson?
Unisat?
And a couple of other companies.
Cash or stock options?
I love it when you talk dirty.
Come back here!
Excuse me.
- What's that?
- A dog.
- Why?
- It's Elizabeth's gift to Mother.
She feels guilty about missing the party.
She's stuck at some UCLA seminar.
I gotta go pick up Maude's present.
I want you to know something, Linus.
I'm glad about Elizabeth.
You should be.
She's terrific.
She's smart, independent, pretty as hell.
- Why don't you marry her?
- Go on.
I'm kidding.
Kidding.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm great.
How are you?
Good.
I'm just surprised to see you here.
Well, you know me.
Don't you?
Can I give you a lift?
Are you on your way home?
- Yes.
- Well, that's convenient.
You wouldn't mind?
You know, I can't remember the name of your street.
Dusoris Lane.
What?
That's where I live.
- Small world.
- Big lane.
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- Yeah.
Of course I do.
You're my neighbor... on Dusoris Lane.
And you're David.
I sure am.
- One of the lesser Larrabees.
- Oh, in what way lesser?
Pretty much every way, but, please, no pity.
I could have sworn I knew every pretty girl on the north shore.
I could have sworn you took in more territory than that.
- Ouch.
- Although that was a while ago.
I heard somewhere that you're engaged to be married.
Oh, yeah, I am, but we're both... very busy, busy people... and it's been very difficult to set a date.
Give me one clue.
Oh, no.
This is too much fun.
- Please.
- There's your driveway.
I was just gonna say that.
Would you like to come in for a drink?
What a good idea.
Wow.
Looks like you're having a party.
Tomorrow night.
They used to have lovely parties here.
Then you've been to them.
But I saw the lights from a distance.
What's the occasion?
It's too late for an engagement party.
As a matter of fact, my fiancée is in California this week.
It's actually a birthday party for my mother... but you probably knew that.
Listen.
Party's at 9:00.
Will you come?
Do you really want me to?
Very much.
If you'll tell me who you are.
Hello, Sabrina.
Hello, Linus.
Sabrina?
- Have a good time in Paris?
- Yes.
Thank you.
You look all grown up.
Sabrina?
- Why does he keep saying that?
- I need to go find my father.
I'll get my bags later.
- Wait a minute.
- Thanks for the ride.
- What are you talking about?
- No.
I brought you a scarf, Joanna.
A real Paris scarf.
- I'll show you how to tie it.
- Has he seen you?
- Yes!
No.
Who?
- Your father.
Oh, Sabrina!
For going out.
For staying in.
For laughs.
Better than Christmas.
Who took these?
I did.
I hope this hangs out before tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is Mrs. Larrabee's birthday party.
Yes.
I've been invited.
- By whom?
- By David.
Of course, he didn't know it was me when he invited me.
Now that he knows?
I'm still invited, I guess.
Maybe I'll try steaming it.
Dad, please?
I promised myself years ago... all of those years, hundreds of times... thousands of times... and now I'm invited.
Excuse me.
Hello.
You're here.
Yes, I am.
That's true.
You look beautiful.
So do you.
Look good.
Fabulous party, Maude.
I'm so sorry Elizabeth can't be here.
So am I. She gave me a dog.
I can't believe I'm here.
I went to a party once in a villa in Provence.
I didn't know a single person.
Rothschild was there.
Everyone was speaking in French.
I could hardly understand a word.
But I felt more comfortable than I do now.
Here.
Drink this as quickly as possible... and it won't seem so strange to you.
- Whoa.
David.
- Better?
Not yet.
Trust me, it will be.
- Which Rothschild?
- Bubba.
Is that funny?
Did Elizabeth pick out her dress?
We're still doing the guest list.
600 so far.
That's just on our side.
That's not a wedding, it's a town.
Stop.
It's going to be wonderful.
Elegant but simple.
Lavish but tasteful.
Cheap but expensive.
- Hi.
- Where have you been?
$23 a pound.
They'll be gone in five minutes.
Eat fast.
You are a princess.
For you.
- Who's that?
- Who?
That girl.
The one with David.
Oh, well, that's...
That's just...
Oh, my God.
That's Sabrina.
David's known her since she was two years old.
She didn't have that dress when she was two years old.
She's drinking champagne and eating seafood... and her hair is washed and her lips are red... and her teeth are white, and he made a song for her.
I don't like it.
Well, Sabrina.
- When did you get back?
- Yesterday.
Happy birthday, Mrs. Larrabee.
For a minute I didn't recognize you.
- It's the haircut.
- To say the least.
Some surprise, isn't she, Mother?
She certainly is, son.
Dance with me.
Now?
While the music's playing.
It's harder when they stop.
Come on.
Yes?
I've been to every party you've ever had.
Right there, watching from that tree.
Like a bat.
And now here we are, dancing in front of God and everyone.
I should have paid more attention to you.
I don't know what I was thinking of.
Yourself.
It feels so good to hold you.
Does it?
Do you know how beautiful you are?
You're dazzling.
Dazzling?
Suddenly back in my life and dazzling.
Am I back in your life?
I don't think you realize what you've done to me.
Then you better tell me.
You're changing everything.
She's like a sister to him, Patrick.
I have a sister.
That's not how we dance.
It's Sabrina.
Go and see.
I can't believe this is happening.
You're absolutely transformed.
And you're exactly the same.
You were perfect.
You still are.
Yes?
Let's go someplace we can talk.
We are talking.
Someplace else.
Please.
I haven't seen you in years.
I'm not sure I ever saw you.
Come with me.
For a little while.
- We could just go...
- To the solarium?
What?
It has to be the solarium.
And you bring a bottle of champagne... and you put the glasses in the back pockets of your jacket.
I don't think there are any back pockets to my jacket.
You were paying attention.
And the orchestra will play...
"How Can I Remember?"
Yes.
I'll have them do that.
And then afterwards...
I'll wake up.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
See you later.
- You got a minute?
- Not right now, actually.
- I have an appointment.
- Sure you do.
David, what are you doing?
Are you insane?
Right smack dab in front of your prominent... and paranoid future in-laws... you are hustling the chauffeur's daughter!
- We were dancing.
- Stop dancing.
I can't have a drink and a dance with an old friend?
Do I look stupid?
I never thought of myself as stupid, but maybe I am.
- I didn't do anything.
- You were planning to!
- How do you know?
- You're kidding, right?
David, you're like my own son.
I am your own son, Mother.
Exactly!
I endured 21 hours of hard labor to bring you into the world.
The doctors begged me to take drugs... but I kept saying I wouldn't do anything to hurt my child.
Well, I've changed my mind.
You screw up with Elizabeth, and I'll kill you.
I don't know.
There's something about Sabrina.
I think...
I know this sounds crazy... but I think I'm falling in love with her.
- Oh, God!
- Listen, I didn't plan this.
I can't help it.
She's so...
Something.
Sensational.
The last time you found someone sensational... it cost the family a million and a half dollars.
- This time it's different.
- Oh, that's so original.
What about Elizabeth?
You finally find the right girl...
Who's got the right parents who own the right company.
- You asked her to marry you.
- Actually, she asked me.
Mother, go outside and blow out your candles.
Can't we send somebody?
What do you think Sabrina wants?
She's lived her whole life above that garage... with her nose pressed against the glass or in that tree... watching us at parties.
Now you invite her to one.
You're in your Rolex jacket or whatever.
You tell her to meet you in the solarium.
She knows you'll show up with a bottle of champagne.
That has nothing to do with it.
She knows what's coming.
The jet to Martha's Vineyard.
The cottage full of food and flowers.
House seats to some sold-out show.
Drinks at the Carlyle.
A day or two of that, she'd fall for Noriega.
You don't know her or the way she makes me feel.
I can't be engaged to somebody when I feel like this.
- Sit down.
- I can't talk about this now.
Just sit down.
- What?
- I sat on the glasses!
Don't move.
Get Dr. Calloway.
He's at the bar.
- Who put glasses on the chair?
- I'm bleeding.
- Could we talk about this later?
- Oh, my God!
Linus, stay with him.
Darling, don't worry.
Just elevate something.
God.
Bad?
Sabrina.
She's waiting for me.
I'll take care of her.
Hello, Sabrina.
I have a message from David.
He won't be able to make it.
He sent me.
I'm sorry.
You're upset.
Of course.
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
I'm a little tired.
Why didn't he come?
He was on his way.
He had a slight accident.
He sat on a champagne flute.
- Is he okay?
- He's in the emergency room.
Emergency room?
It was a sharp flute.
That's a little joke.
Should I drive over to see him?
He'll be fine.
Couple of stitches.
You can see him tomorrow.
- What's this for?
- Part of the message from David.
They've sent you to deal with me, haven't they?
They?
Like a lawyer in a movie.
He goes to the unsuitable waitress... or showgirl or chauffeur's daughter... and says the family is prepared to offer you $ 100,000... to stay away from their son.
"No," she says. "150,000."
200,000.
No.
A million.
No self-respecting lawyer would offer less.
No self-respecting waitress... would take it.
Good girl.
I've loved him all my life.
Have you?
I thought I was over it.
Surprise, surprise.
You don't object?
Object?
To you?
Look at you.
It's as though a lovely breeze has swept through this whole house.
Even though the breeze... comes from the general direction of the garage?
It's the '90s, Sabrina.
So they say.
How can I remember things that never happened
Arms that never held me
Lips I've never kissed
They played that the night before I left for Paris.
They often do play that.
He was dancing right here with someone.
Yeah.
He often does do that.
And tonight you wanted it to be you.
- I don't know why or when or where
- It's all in the family.
I feel suspended
In the air
Somewhere between the dream and the memory
I never thought of you as a dancer.
Crazy about it.
Call me Bojangles at the office.
In all those years, I never saw you do this... meet a girl here with champagne.
Never did it before.
You never had to before.
Is it impossible to believe that I want to dance... with the prettiest girl at the party?
Thank you.
Yes, it is impossible to believe.
Then you don't know me.
I almost forgot.
The rest of the message from David.
Thanks.
I needed that.
- What am I doing?
- No, I apologize.
No, I should never have...
You have my handprint on your face.
Maybe it's better if you pick up your messages in person.
You'll see David tomorrow.
Good night.
Mack, I'm gonna stay out here for the next two days.
Cancel whatever I've got and reschedule.
Have the plane stand by for 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow morning... and set up the Vineyard cottage.
I don't know.
Flowers, candles, singers.
- Wonderful party, Linus.
- Thank you.
Call David's secretary.
It's the only thing she ever does.
Why not?
Hell, I'm up.
You're up.
You weren't?
Well, call her anyway.
Thank you very much for coming.
Good to see you.
Good night.
Jesus.
A dog.
What is there, an epidemic of sleeping sickness?
Okay, listen.
David can't stand pain, so I want you to give him a combination... of morphine and...
I don't...
Okay, not morphine, but something strong... and mixed with a sleeping tablet like Halcion.
They haven't proved that, Frank.
We have no idea.
Maude thinks they were left on the chair by some guest.
He's not gonna sue his own mother.
Well, he's not me.
Wait, you're not going to work that way, are you?
- Give us a moment?
- Sure, Mr. Larrabee.
Tyson say anything after I left last night?
He wondered where everybody had gone.
Maybe I should talk to Sabrina.
And say what?
"Sabrina, you're very lovely... but David has a short attention span.
He's just jerking your chain."
Can I say that to a woman?
"Jerking your chain"?
- When's Elizabeth due back?
- Thursday.
Should we try to get her back sooner?
I don't want him trying to break off the engagement.
This all happened in 24 hours.
I can make it unhappen in 48.
I like Sabrina.
I always have.
But I'm not about to kiss off a billion dollars.
I don't care what she did to her hair.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'll take you up to see David.
Thank you.
Can he hear me?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did the dry cleaners have your car?
- How do you feel?
- I didn't get there.
Did I?
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Am I in a lot of pain?
Look at your little hand.
Guess what happened to me.
I know.
I know.
I feel awful.
Me too.
How do you feel, Linus?
You're falling a little behind here, David.
Do you want me to stay with you?
Listen.
We got you a terrific nurse and a two-day supply of red Jell-O.
He really should rest.
- Isn't Mr. Linus going in?
- He has other work today.
Oh, very good, madame.
I'm sure he'll be more responsive next time.
Don't worry.
See you.
Thank you.
You know...
I was wondering.
We have this summer cottage on the Vineyard we never use.
I want to put it on the market.
I was going to have a few pictures taken... the kind that make it look bigger than it is.
I understand you have an interest in photography.
I thought you might like to take them.
Trip would be no trouble.
Helicopter could pick us up here.
Plane's at Republic.
Is that a lot to ask?
Saves all that time fighting traffic.
And all those tollbooths.
- No, thanks.
- Something to drink, Miss Fairchild?
- Sabrina.
- What a beautiful name.
- Carol.
- Sorry.
Can I get you something...
Pellegrino.
Same.
Mack, anything from Granger?
Anybody else at SEC?
No, tell him I'll call him back as soon as I can.
So that really is a beautiful name.
How did you get it?
My father's reading.
It's in a poem.
"Sabrina fair, listen where thou art sitting... under the glassy, cool, translucent wave... in twisted braids of lilies knitting the loose train... of thy amber-dropping hair."
- Amber-dropping hair.
That's...
- Carol.
I'm sorry.
It's an incredible airplane.
It's beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.
Ah, yes.
Don't you ever look out the window?
When do I have time?
What happened to all that time we saved taking the helicopter?
I'm storing it up.
No, you're not.
So your little poem...
what does it mean?
It's the story of a water sprite... who saved a virgin from a fate worse than death.
- Sabrina's the virgin.
- Sabrina's the savior.
Is it always like this?
I don't know.
I haven't been here in years.
How can you have a place like this and never come here?
Gee, I don't know.
I guess I...
I just never had anybody to share it with.
I guess.
You could always hire somebody.
No, wait, not me.
The house, please.
You're in the house.
It humanizes it.
I don't like having my picture taken.
I come out...
Looking depressed.
Are you depressed?
Maybe that's not exactly the right word.
What is the right word?
I don't know.
Lonely, maybe.
- You think that's funny?
- No.
I just expected you to say something else.
No, I suppose you're right.
It is funny.
Linus Larrabee is lonely.
I'm sorry.
I made you uncomfortable.
Let's get the outside.
Do you want a view from the house?
Sure.
- Which one?
- All of them.
More isn't always better, Linus.
Sometimes it's just more.
Pick one.
I don't know anything about...
Don't take a picture.
Just look.
Ocean, ocean, ocean, ocean.
Quaint little fishing village.
Ocean, ocean.
Lighthouse.
Guy going into the lighthouse.
There's a job for you.
What must that be like?
What kind of a guy takes a job keeping a lighthouse?
Every time I look through a camera, I'm surprised.
Like finding yourself in the middle of a story, like you just did.
What kind of a guy takes a job keeping a lighthouse?
I think I've been taking pictures all my life... long before I ever had a camera.
Excuse me.
Well, call him back, Mother.
Raise the offer half a point.
No more.
Here?
Lousy.
So far, I'm more affected than she is.
I damn near cried twice.
I'm running out of time here.
I don't know what to try.
Okay.
Finished.
We'll have some lunch, and then you probably... oughta get a look at the island while you're here.
You miss Paris?
Not yet, but I will.
- You liked it there?
- I loved it.
You'd probably hate it.
What?
Why?
It's all about pleasure.
They work hard.
They just know when to quit and enjoy themselves.
What a beautiful building.
Nobody builds with brick anymore.
That's late 1800s.
In Paris, they'd consider that brand-new.
- I hope they don't tear it down.
- They won't.
I own it, that whole block.
I donated it to the village as a halfway house.
You know... jails are full of guys that never had a break.
Look at this guy picking cans.
They get back to the wall, commit some petty crime.
They're stuck.
They're outsiders for the rest of their lives.
It's not fair.
The only chance they'll ever have is a halfway house... that'll help them get their feet under 'em.
Excuse me.
- Could you take a picture of us?
- Yeah.
It's that one.
Are you done?
- I don't think I can eat any more.
- It's too late to free them.
You know, you are not exactly what people say you are.
Oh, yeah?
What do they say I am?
You know.
Well... that you're the world's only living heart donor.
Oh.
That.
And... how does this one go?
He thinks that morals are paintings on walls... and scruples are money in Russia.
That's droll.
- And then there's my favorite...
- No, I get the picture.
It's enough.
Do you remember the rainy afternoon we spent together?
Sorry.
My father had... had driven your mother and David into town for a music lesson.
How old was he?
I don't know.
Fourteen, fifteen.
- That would be the oboe.
- The oboe?
It was a misunderstanding.
He thought he was gonna get to take hobo lessons.
It was a rainy afternoon?
Stormy.
I was afraid, and I came into your house... and tried to turn on a lamp, but I got a shock.
I thought I'd been struck by lightning.
And you stayed with me all afternoon... till my father came home.
And you didn't cry.
You were a brave kid.
I was more afraid of you than being electrocuted.
Everybody was.
Is that the reason you never got married?
You probably don't believe in marriage.
Yes, I do.
That's why I never got married.
David, on the other hand, believes in the tooth fairy.
- That's why I like him.
- Well, I like him too.
Matter of fact, I love him.
I don't know what to do with him.
When he was a kid, he used to love to come into the office.
He'd sit behind my father's desk and write memos.
Then he'd read the ticker tape.
One day, he just stopped.
I can't figure out...
Are those the only things people say about me?
It was a nice day.
You were a little tough on me, I thought.
I guess you're used to being treated very carefully.
- When will you have the pictures?
- Tomorrow.
Could you drop them by the office?
Sure.
Well, good night, then, Sabrina fair.
Yeah?
My father once asked David... why he stopped coming to the office.
And David said, "What do they need me for?
Linus is there."
Listen, I do real work in the real world.
David watches from the north shore.
I know you work in the real world, and you're awfully good at it.
I'll bet you haven't made a wrong move since you were three.
But that's work.
Where do you live, Linus?
It was a nice day.
Thanks.
It's open.
- Where were you?
In town?
- On Martha's Vineyard.
Linus wanted me to take some pictures.
Linus did?
I love so many things about you, Dad.
But you know what I love best of all?
You became a chauffeur because you wanted to have time to read.
All my life, I've pictured you... sitting in the front seat of a long succession of cars... waiting for the Larrabees and reading.
We had baked clams.
Linus baked them.
I used to be so afraid of him.
It's appropriate.
- What was he like as a child?
- Shorter.
I look out the window... and I see someone, and it is a young woman.
So I say, "What is a young woman doing in the courtyard... at this time of night?"
So I am looking and looking, and I see Sabrina.
She's talking.
Who is she talking to?
A man.
Not her daddy, because he's not as tall.
It was Linus.
Sabrina went out with Linus.
- It was Mr. Linus.
- Sabrina went out with Linus?
- That's too weird.
- I thought the guy was gay.
- Mr. Linus is not a gay.
- It's not "a gay." It's just gay.
Linus Larrabee is gay?
That makes me like him better.
Linus Larrabee is a heterosexual.
- He's still sleeping.
- Oh, is that normal?
When you're taking what he's taking, it is.
He wakes up from time to time.
- Has he asked for anyone?
- Bert and Ernie.
Could you tell him Sabrina was here?
I could tell him the pope was here, but it wouldn't make a dent.
I have to go into the city, but I'll be back by 7:00.
Could you tell him?
Quarterly reports from Publishing will be on-line at 4.00.
International wants a teleconference at 5:15.
Harvey called.
You know that old brick building that we own out at the Vineyard?
Yes.
You ever heard me referred to as the world's only living heart donor?
Have the Rons find out if there's any tax advantage... to donating that building to the town out there.
- If there isn't?
- Then forget it.
Oh, and I want two tickets tonight... for whatever Broadway show nobody can get tickets for.
And a table at the Carlyle for drinks.
- For whom?
- Me.
I know.
I seldom go to the theater.
- Seldom?
- I'm not a theater buff.
Buff?
The most difficult tickets will be for a Broadway musical.
Okay.
That means that the actors, periodically... will dance about and burst into song.
Forget the thing about the tax advantage.
Tell the Rons I want that building donated to the town.
And I want it used as a halfway house.
Sabrina Fairchild.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
Wow.
It's big.
This is where I do that real work in the real world... instead of living.
You remembered.
Doesn't come up every day.
Would you like some coffee?
No, thanks.
Some of these are very good.
- Don't sound so surprised.
- I'm not.
This is an unusual view of the house.
Well... you said you wanted it to look bigger.
Sorry.
No, you have...
Here.
You've got to admit, it's beautiful.
I probably would... if you'd let me.
I found myself in Paris.
A friend said that.
- You were missing?
- Yes.
I once was lost and now am found.
- You're making fun.
- It's my turn.
- You're very photogenic.
- That's 'cause I'm handsome.
No, that's not it.
But not as handsome as David.
Nobody's as handsome as David... even David.
Don't tell him that till he's fully recovered.
Are you sure I can't get you anything?
Cafe au lait, snails, French fries?
- Theater tickets?
- Theater tickets?
I thought I'd take my first step towards...
What is all that French stuff?
The good life?
Knowing when to quit?
Maybe it's a bad idea.
No, it's a good idea.
It was my favorite food in France.
There's this little place in Pigal.
I ate there at least twice a week.
It's good.
Enjoy.
It's really so much better if you eat with your hands.
- Do you mind?
