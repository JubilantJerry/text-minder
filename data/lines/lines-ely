You will have access to whatever resources and Intel you'll need.
Those of you employed by your respective government agencies will stay as such, and the rest of you will be private contractors.
I tried to stop them... but I failed.
Why am I here?
Maybe this is your redemption.
And for the rest of us, a way to remind us of how easy it is to become what you're hunting.
So believe me when I say that what we're asking you to do is next to impossible.
This team will be taking down people who think they're untouchable, organizations who believe that justice doesn't apply to them.
But we chose you for a reason.
We believe that you, and you alone, can stop them.
Okay.
So, who's in charge?
Who do we report to?
My son.
- Previously on "Quantico"...
- Jeremy Miller.
Apparently, my scenarios were so accurate, they recruited me to come up with new ones.
- No one suspects you're a double agent?
- Nope.
Every asset you develop at The Farm is critical for us.
Elliot's father, you may have heard of him.
Sir Laurence Bishop.
Your father-in-law is a very... powerful man.
It's good to see you, Pip.
You did this to me!
Alex, we were wrong.
There is no AIC.
Come on.
We got to get out of here.
Hey, wait!
Wait!
Stop!
We failed... because we aligned ourselves with the wrong people.
Sebastian!
No!
No, no, no!
[Helicopter blades whirring]
[Police sirens wailing]
You have to stay here, sir.
[Indistinct talking]
He gonna be okay?
Well, I hope so, you know.
She was his wife, wand you didn't know about her?
When'd you last talk to him?
When I left The Farm.
Why?
What about you and Dayana?
Not since she got me kicked out.
Have you seen her?
No one here will tell me anything.
No.
I haven't seen Alex, either.
And who can confirm your reason for being at the G20?
Seriously?
How about DDO Matthew Keyes?
Or, I don't know, try calling the former President of the United States!
Yeah.
Write that down.
I apologize, Mr. Booth.
- Your story's just been corroborated.
- By who?
Someone who needs to speak with you immediately.
Alex:
Ryan.
Alex, what the hell's going on here?
So, Dayana didn't come out of the perimeter, nor did Will.
Lydia:
Six hours ago, I retrieved the hard drives that the group you call the AIC were after at the summit.
I hid them.
Rather than risk getting caught and letting them fall into the wrong hands.
I believe Dayana stayed behind to find those drives and took Will to decrypt them so she could finish the AIC mission.
[Scoffs]
Look, Dayana's had her dark moments, but the AIC?
She told me herself.
When the terrorists were interrogating us,
Dayana told me they were looking for her.
She begged me to protect her, so I did.
We need to get back inside right now.
- Who's coming with me?
- No one.
Look around you.
I count at least 2,000 of New York's finest, along with the FBI.
Let them finish this.
The public thinks this crisis is over.
If we send the NYPD and the FBI in on a manhunt, people will notice, and then... the panic and the chaos will start all over again.
We need a small, tactical team that will escape notice, people who understand what's going on.
Let's get those drives.
Shelby:
Where are the reports from the primary hostage interviews?
Every single person coming out of that zone is a suspect.
You should've just let me walk in.
I'm still in charge.
Not anymore.
Here is Shelby.
Let's go.
What are you doing here?
You need to arrest her.
Me, too.
[Sighs] You have questions.
We have answers.
♪ ♪
Did we just get a man killed?
No.
We didn't even know who he was.
We knew he was up to something, that he'd been spying on us at The Farm for months.
Ryan said that whoever the AIC are, what Lydia is doing has nothing to do with it.
It's just black ops.
Who do we go to about this?
N-No one.
I...
I'd call the police, let them figure it out.
- Owen.
- You have to stop thinking like an FBI agent.
All we did was open the door, a door that was set up to kill anyone who opened it.
Now, whatever it's about, or whether my daughter is or is not a part of it, it's a real threat, and that explosion just proved it.

Yeah, so we go after that.

Hey.
What happened to you last night?
When we were at the NSA, Lydia had you do something.
It's classified.
Yeah, well, where it led to wasn't.
A squat one town over.
Someone's been surveying us.
Or maybe that's what she wanted us to believe, and she said what she said to throw us off the track.
There is no AIC, Alex.
I don't know what you found, but this investigation's over.
Miranda ordered me to wrap it up here.
Wrap it up?
What do you mean "wrap it up"?
They gave me a couple of days.
Keyes doesn't want anyone to suspect the FBI was here, undercover this whole time.
Look, Ryan, this place that we found,
I don't who's behind it, but something's going on.
We can't leave right now.
Well, you don't have to.
You're not FBI.
But they are.
Keyes:
Well, good afternoon.
I know you're not used to anyone but Owen leading class, but this is a week I always teach.
With that, meet Jonathan Lyons...
Yale graduate, champion rower, and one of the best recruits to ever walk these halls.
His first assignment was his dream assignment...
Moscow Station.
It was also his last.
Mr. Lyons was working an asset in the Ministry of Defense.
That asset turned out to be a dangle... a trap.
FSB arrested him with compromising material and promptly sent him home PNG... persona non Grata.
Mr. Lyons is no longer welcome in the Russian Federation, and due to the public nature of his exposure, unable to serve anywhere but a desk at the Agency.
Jonathan was lucky.
He was green, and he had nothing to lose except his career.
But for more experienced operatives, exposure can cost you your freedom, it can cost your assets their lives, and as we've learned the hard way, once set in motion, it can rarely be stopped.
McKinnon:
Mr. Hall?
Now, back in the old days...
Can I help you?
I'm Special Agent Jane McKinnon.
This is my partner, Will Kelaher.
Okay.
Your recruits' identities are safe.
We're both cleared to be here.
We promise it won't interfere with your instruction.
We're investigating the nearby death of a man last night.
His remains were found in the aftermath of an explosion in an abandoned building.
I'm happy to help.
So, what does this have to do with me?
The body is one of your former recruits.
Do you recognize this man?

She's been trustworthy to me.
No offense, but weren't you Liam O'Connor's best friend?
Hey, we don't have to trust her, and I definitely don't.
We just have to make sure that those drives don't fall into the wrong hands.

We have to act fast.
The bank, the library, the Federal Reserve and the Exchange will all have the capabilities to upload the drives.

You three take the bank and the Exchange.

The list of charges against the Citizen's Liberation Front, which includes both of you, is... why don't we start with arson, assault, conspiracy to defraud the government, possession of a biological weapon,
extortion, homicide in the first and second degree.
Oh, right, and treason.
I was told these people wanted to do good.
They did.
Miranda knew this was coming.
She asked me to be her eyes and ears on the inside, just in case things got out of control.
But neither of us could predict the Citizen's Liberation Front would turn radical and so much blood would be spilled.
Since there is no precedent for two decorated agents taking up arms against their own country,
I'm gonna have to make a few phone calls to figure out what the procedure is.
Now, when an operative dies, we add a star to Langley's Wall of Honor.
And currently, that wall has 117 stars.
That's 117 Agency employees who died doing their duty.
Now, to keep you off that wall, and to keep me from appearing at your loved ones' front door, we ask all operatives to put together an EAP, or emergency action plan.
This is a course of action for how to get out alive if you're exposed.
Now, when you're exposed, you have to find a way to communicate with your assets quickly and discreetly via dead drop.
It begins with a signal.
When the asset collects the drop, it's important for them to signal back.
Even in this digital age, don't discount the importance of good, old-fashioned spycraft.
And whatever you do, don't get caught!
Ms. Mampasi, we're from the FBI, and we're asking a couple of questions about a former recruit here...
Jeremy Miller?

I never met him.
I-I knew him one day, but we barely talked.

How?
Keyes:
Now, sometimes you can't even risk contact with your assets.

In that case, there's only one option...
Salt the earth.

Hello.
Ottawa is only 90 minutes by plane.
I can pop down.
Tell the CIA I want to check on my exchange student while I'm nearby.
Yeah, so, Pip told you I was leaving.
Pip told me you want to.
But I'm not pulling you.

That's that, then, is it?
Yes.
It is.

We don't believe any of the recruits were connected to Miller.
It's not a leap that he turned obsessed after getting cut by you.
The explosion last night... seems a case of suicide by paranoia.
That's a relief.
I wish it were.
Do you recognize this?
It's a digital tap...
Agency-issued.
We retrieved it from a data junction at Soong Technologies this afternoon.
Otherwise known as the National Security Agency.
Miller was accessing their data from his laptop, and we traced it back to the NSA.
Been to the NSA lately?
My operations here are strictly confidential.
You may have told your recruits the NSA didn't know what they were doing there... but we know you called and told them.
Erasing your recruits' personal information.
But you lied.
You didn't tell them what you were really doing.
We have the evidence.
It's only a matter of time before we connect this to you.
Oh, and your daughter, she taught this lesson with you, didn't she?
This isn't going to end well... for either of you.
Talk now or talk later.
Which is it going to be?
No sign of her at the Reserve, Alex.

Nothing at the bank.
We're headed south.
Keep an eye on the streets.

When we get through this...
If we get through it.
...the world will finally know you and my dad were right all along.
Of course, that's a great comfort to me because I just lost my career, most of my friends, my fiancé, your dad's freedom, and people died.
But, no, I should feel happy because I was right.
You should feel vindicated.
The group you never gave up believing in actually existed all along.
Maybe you'll finally live up to that hero title you were trying to get at the CIA.
And my father, maybe they'll pardon him.
Maybe.
Or you could have had him pardoned any time you wanted by just coming forward and admitting that he took the fall for you.

You've got a look on your face of a man who's just accepted he's about to die.
I think my time here may be coming to an end.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think mine might be nearly done, too.
[Sighs]
I spent years... hoping to make a man pay for the pain he caused, never once considering that he might have felt pain himself and learned from it.
Hmm.
It was easier for me to believe my daughter was a traitor than to just look at... how irreparable our relationship had become.
Do you know what, Owen?
My will... has one page.
I have nobody in my life to leave anything to.
I mean, I don't even have anything to leave.
I mean, if you weren't talking to me right now, would I even exist?
Hmm?

If I want a crack at some sort of human connection,
I'm not gonna get it shut in the house by myself, am I?

- And neither are you.
No, I'm not.
So, how many drinks does it take to face your own mortality?
[Laughs]
I'll tell you when I get there.
You know, I don't even know what they really want from us.
Well, I think they just want us to face the reality of what this is, like, we could die at any moment.
Well, then, this exercise was definitely dreamt up by Americans.
[Chuckling]
You know what I realized?
All of us here are single.
Do you think they did that on purpose?
I think it helps to have people who are single.
They have more focus.
Yeah, so they can take in information clearly.

You know, when I was younger... the generals, they would isolate us from our families and turn us against them so that we would feel like we had no one else but them.
And it's not so far off, what they're asking us to do here...
Die for our country.
Wouldn't you want to?
You're damn straight I would.
Oh, it looks like we all had the same idea.
An Irish wake before we plan our funeral.

- All right.
Hey, did you speak to Lydia about Jeremy Miller?
Yes, and she had no idea about him.
The prevailing theory is that, he followed the tap that I put in and hijacked the feed.
Okay, they think that he is obsessed over being cut out of The Farm and that he was planning something big.
Maybe even going after all of us.
Thank you.
So... his death may have been a good thing, if something like that can be.
She told you all of that?
The FBI wouldn't tell me anything.
That's because you're not FBI anymore.
And I might not be, either.
Lydia asked me to stay.

Of course I want you to.

They recruited him after he was cut from The Farm for the same reasons that the CIA wanted him...
His scenarios.
He politely declined.
Then, they tried to take him out.
He went to the only people who could help him...
The instructors at The Farm.
Angie Reynolds and Jason Bowling, the remaining instructors at The Farm, told him that they knew of this group, that they themselves had formed a group to fight them.
It was full of operatives from the Agency.
They call themselves... the Citizen's Liberation Front.
They didn't know who the bad guys were or exactly what they were planning.
They just had to be ready in case.
They needed help from the FBI...
Someone who would be sure that we wouldn't get in the way of what they might need to do to bring this group down.

It became clear that she was a part of it.

But there's a chance here to use what they wanted for a greater good, to burn down the corruption that is eating away at this country and give us the fresh start we need.
I won't let you.

What happened today had nothing to do with the FBI, the CIA, or you.
It was simply a terrorist attack by a cell of the Islamic Front.
That is the official narrative.

Good afternoon.
I'm glad you could all make it.
It's not like we had a choice.
The entire G20 summit was premised on the world's intelligence organizations coming together to share their secrets once and for all and to stand down their spying.
Which is why they turned over their drives.
Those drives contain something far more valuable than the information on them.
They contain patterns, years of behavior from each member country, and America's got out.
These patterns give a road-map to how a country reacts to any event.
With this information, an enemy can create an attack so perfect that the people won't know it's happening until it's too late.
Anybody wanting to attack America just got a huge windfall if they know where to look.
I'm forming a select team to fight it.
A covert joint-task force.
To figure out who's coming for us and to find this information before they use it against us.
The AIC is the hand of a much larger body.
The people behind them know the information is out there.
We can tell when they've accessed it, just not by whom.
Your job will be to monitor it, find out who's responsible, and to respond accordingly.
You will have access to whatever resources and Intel you'll need.
Those of you employed by your respective government agencies will stay as such, and the rest of you will be private contractors.
Nihmah:
I tried to stop them... but I failed.
Why am I here?
Maybe this is your redemption.
And for the rest of us, a way to remind us of how easy it is to become what you're hunting.
So believe me when I say that what we're asking you to do is next to impossible.
This team will be taking down people who think they're untouchable, organizations who believe that justice doesn't apply to them.
But we chose you for a reason.
We believe that you, and you alone, can stop them.

Okay.
So, who's in charge?
Who do we report to?
My son.
Okay, only six more days till you, me, Andi and Marcy are on a plane to Vegas.
- (laughs)
- Oh, we have been planning this trip for three years and something always, always screws it up.
Well, it was your fault we canceled last year.
You had to go out and get food poisoning.
Yeah, because you cooked me fish you bought from a guy in a van.
He was wearing a captain's hat.
He seemed legit.
And the year before that, you had to pet that coyote.
He came right up to me.
Okay, for the next six days, we play it safe.
No dares, no bets, no making the crew laugh with your nail gun tricks.
Nothing is gonna get in the way of our trip.
All right?
Did you confirm the hotel reservation?
Yeah, I even talked them into giving us the convention discount.
Uh-huh.
Okay, what's the catch?
No catch.
Just, someone's gonna have to pretend to be a podiatrist.
And, um, possibly give a quick 90-minute speech.
Hey, Emme, how was ballet?
Great, I was the cutest one.
She's gonna be trouble, isn't she?
Yeah, a little bit.
(sing-songy):
Six days to Vegas.
I know, I'm excited.
Oh, but,
- uh, guess what I heard at ballet?
- Hmm?
Chad Thompson had a birthday party last week and Teddy wasn't invited.
What?
Wait, which one's Chad Thompson?
The one that calls you "toots"?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He's the one who's got the head that's too big for his body.
Oh, yeah, yeah, Bubblehead Thompson, yeah.
Yeah.
I just...
I hope Teddy's not upset.
Oh, well, let's find out.
I don't suggest this often, but let's go talk to our children.
(door closes)
Okay, you go.
Why don't you go?
You're closer.
Teddy?
Listen, uh, Mom wants to talk to you.
So, Teddy...
Hey, what's going on with Chad Thompson these days?
I-I heard he had a birthday party last week?
I didn't want to go to that.
We don't really hang out anymore.
Oh, oh. (chuckles)
Well, so, who do you hang out with?
The guys who play Astroline Rebellion, the greatest computer game of all time.
Oh.
Huh.
So, kids at your school play that?
No.
I've never met them in person.
They're online friends.
Oh.
Wow. (chuckles)
That is, um... troubling?
They're great guys...
SpaceBoss, LonerZero, TheGoobs43.
The-the goobs?
What-what's a goobs?
Wh-What kind of kids are these?
They're called dorks.
All right, but, um, sweetie, you-you hang out with actual kids at your school, too, right?
Yeah, yeah, kids you definitely know aren't, like, grown men in some Internet cafe in Bangkok.
Not really.
I'm more of an online presence these days.
- Oh.
- Hmm.
Oh, I should have taken him fishing more.
Okay, I didn't do it sooner because I didn't want to jinx it.
But I booked our flights to Vegas.
Great news: all middle seats.
Okay, how come we let Don plan these trips?
Next year, we got to make sure someone's in charge of making sure he's not in charge.
I don't if now is the right time to go, you know?
I mean, what, with Teddy and the space goobers.
What?
So he's a nerd.
He's happy.
You're just saying that 'cause you want to go to Vegas.
Yes.
Yes, but also, he seems fine.
Yeah, the world needs nerds.
What do you think would have happened if Bill Gates' parents had freaked out about him being a nerd, huh?
There'd be no Angry Birds, I'll tell you that.
I just don't want the other kids to think he's weird and then give him a hard time.
Growing up is tough. (chuckles)
You know, I don't have any personal experience being an outsider, 'cause I've always been hot and athletic.
- Mm-hmm.
- But, um,
- I think Don can relate.
- Mm.
Yeah.
In high school,
Jimmy Dugan used to follow me around and call me a shaved gorilla.
- (laughs)
- Oh...
Oh, a shaved gorilla.
That's a...
Yeah, well, I was a nerd growing up and it wasn't easy.
(scoffs) You know, you're always saying that, but I am not buying it.
If anything, you were a hot nerd.
Like, uh, like Velma on Scooby-Doo.
Ah, you think so, huh?
Oh, yeah.
When you wear your reading glasses... (whistles)
All right...
Well, that's because I didn't go to the same high school as the three of you.
Okay, I am gonna tell you guys something
I have never told anyone before.
My freshman year...
You slept with a teacher?
You got a boob job?
Why is no one else guessing?
Okay, I had just moved here from Virginia and I hadn't made many friends.
I thought, "I'm gonna make a big splash at the homecoming game."
So, I go to the mall.
And there, in the window, is a leather suit.
Okay?
Just like the one Eddie Murphy wore in his stand-up special.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
It was shiny, skintight and bright red.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
And I spent all my babysitting money on it 'cause I thought... (scoffs)
"With this suit, I can't lose."
I hope this works out for her.
You're not good with tone, are you?
ANDI:
Yeah,
I realized my mistake as soon as I hit the bleachers.
You see... leather makes a sound.
It's a sound that-that makes people stop and stare.
Why do I know this story?
And that's when I started to sweat.
A lot.
And then, a cheerleader from the other school saw me in my Eddie Murphy suit and she flipped her little ponytail at me and she said,
"Oh, hey, look, it's... "
BOTH:
Sweaty Murphy.
What?
But how did you know that?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're Sweaty Murphy?
(laughs)
I played in that game.
We talked about you in the huddle.
We laughed so hard, they threw a flag.
No, no, no, no, the only way you would know that is if... (swallows hard)
Oh, my God.
You're the girl with the ponytail.
Oh!
(laughs)
And you're the girl in the suit, this is so funny!
(laughs)
You don't think it's funny.
DON:
Well, I'm just glad you're okay, because word on the street was that Sweaty Murphy went crazy and ended up in a home somewhere.
Yeah, my home.
I can't believe I married Sweaty Murphy!
(laughs)
It's not funny.
It's a little funny.
Funny.
I can't believe we have been friends all these years and that was you.
You are not really mad about this, are you?
It was years ago.
No, no, I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess I would have recognized you sooner, but your hair's too thin for a ponytail now.
(gasps)
Oh, yeah, I said it.
Don, car.
No, no, no, don't bother leaving,
I'm going upstairs.
(Adam groans)
Wow.
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad none of that was Marcy's fault.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm just practicing for the car ride home.
Ah...
Oh, boy.
How was your night?
Bad.
Marcy wanted to talk.
I spent years training her not to depend on me for emotional support.
That's all out the window!
After you guys left,
Andi went off about Marcy.
She went through all the English curse words, then started swearing in Portuguese like her grandmother.
This Vegas trip is starting to feel very shaky.
Oh, don't even say that.
I need this trip.
All year, I've been working in this dump...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is our business.
I'm sorry, you know I love this place, but the thought of Vegas is the only thing that gets me through the day in this hellhole.
Look, I want to go, too.
But I don't think it's gonna happen, unless Marcy apologizes.
Well, there's two things Marcy never does:
one of them, she did before we got married and then she stopped.
The one you're talking about, she's never done.
Well, we got to figure out a way to talk her into it.
Yeah, I'll be fine.
You know, it's been so long, I don't even miss it anymore.
Oh, you mean the other thing.
You want me to apologize?
That's a great idea.
Adam, you know I love Andi.
She's one of my best friends, but she totally overreacted.
All right, between you and me,
I totally agree.
Also between you and me, I never said that.
She also said a very hurtful thing to me.
My hair is thick and luxurious, right, Don?
Like a yak's chest, baby.
Thank you.
Well, look, Marcy, you are a very powerful woman.
Like a yak!
Okay, uh, Don here is a shell of a man, so job well done.
But with that power comes responsibility.
You have the opportunity now to be the bigger person.
Hmm.
Appealing to my vanity, I like it.
Okay, I'll do it.
Yes!
Great.
This'll mean a lot to Andi.
Oh, and when you do it, if she starts talking in Portuguese, just power through, that's all compliments.
(door opens)
There she is.
Surprise!
Look who came to see you.
Hello, Marcy.
That was in English, that's a good sign.
So, Andi, I just wanted to say...
Oh, you know what?
Nothing you say can change what happened.
All right?
I mean, all these years, I have regretted not thinking of the perfect comeback for when you called me "Sweaty Murphy"...
- (groans) - but I see now that I'm not small and mean like you.
I don't have to blow out other people's candles to make mine shine brighter.
I saw that on a poster in the dentist's office,
I thought it was quite something.
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what?
I cannot believe that you are still upset about something that happened when we were kids!
It's kind of crazy.
Who are you calling crazy, doll hair?
- Oh!
- Okay, okay, okay,
I think we're moving in the wrong direction here.
Honey, Marcy came over to apologize.
No, no, I am not apologizing anymore.
She's completely overreacting again.
Overreact... uh.
A-Are you hearing this?
Do you think I'm overreacting?
Me?
Uh... do I think you're overreacting?
She's looking right at you.
Everyone in the room knows she's talking to you.
Adam?
Well, you are reacting.
And it's definitely not too little. (chuckles)
It's... well, there's underreacting.
Right?
Then there's regular reacting.
You know.
Then there's, uh... you.
That means over!
I never said it!
All right.
I gave it a shot, Adam.
I'm out.
Don, car.
(Don inhales, exhales)
I never get to stay anywhere.
I can't believe you didn't back me up.
Come on, Andi.
I always have your back.
I just don't think that something that happened in high school should cause all these problems today.
Because you turned out awesome.
Well, yeah.
I am pretty great.
You know, but it was a long road to get here.
(exhales) When she said,
"Don, car," I guess she meant,
"Don, I'm taking the car."
Okay, well, good.
I'm glad you're back, because you can help me.
Okay, don't you think everybody would be better off if Andi just let this go?
Be the bigger person, and just forgive Marcy.
Yeah, I-I mean, I did that to the guy from high school who used to call me a shaved gorilla.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Wait, you're not just making this up as you go along?
- No.
- 'Cause I need something good here.
No.
I-It's a nice story, actually.
Couple years ago, he came to me looking for a job, and I took that opportunity to be the bigger man.
I told him to go to hell.
How does that make you the bigger man?
Well, he's like five-seven.
I'm way bigger.
I knew it.
All the parts of a good story, but still useless.
Don, why are you on his side?
You were a nerd in high school, too, and he doesn't get it.
I get it.
Oh, really?
Have you ever been so desperate to get out of a leather suit that you broke the zipper?
And then your dad had to cut you out with an electric carving knife?
Okay.
To be fair, that's a really small club.
You know, now that I think about it,
Adam sailed through high school.
He was always the winner, always popular.
Okay.
Look, I can't help it if people are drawn to me.
I'm... magnetic.
I don't know.
Life's been easy for you, hasn't it?
It's... it's been a good run, yeah.
Well, you remember at dinner, when I told you they called me a shaved gorilla?
He laughed.
Oh, no.
I do remember that.
It's a funny idea.
I mean, picture a gorilla.
Then, you shave him.
You never see that.
(chuckles)
You know,
- I think I'm on Andi's side now.
- (groans)
And I don't think she overreacted at all.
I think you underreacted.
You're an underreactor.
You are on the right side of history, Don.
What?
What is happening here?
Now you got him nuts?
Just because of one day, like, a million years ago?
Adam, it wasn't just one day.
I mean, people called me Sweaty Murphy for months.
All right?
Even my homeroom teacher.
She'd do roll call in the morning, she'd be, like,
"Murphy," comma, "Sweaty?"
And I'd have to be, like, "Here."
Oh.
Okay.
I didn't know any of that.
I think it's time you leave, Adam.
It's my house, Don.
Well, it looks like you win again, doesn't it?
(door closes, knocks on wall)
Hey, Marcy.
Why are you here?
Apparently, I'm on your team, now.
Oh, ho, ho.
We're gonna be unstoppable!
What?
No...
No!
It's not good.
So how do you want to get 'em?
Okay, we're getting them.
Look, Andi is really upset.
- (sighs)
- And now, she's got Don all worked up, too.
She even took him to the school-parent mixer tonight, instead of me, because he's on her team.
I had no idea this would be such a big deal to her.
Okay, look.
I don't think either one of us really understood her point of view before, because she's right.
We haven't gone through it.
- (sighs)
- And I definitely didn't handle things the way I should've.
Well, to be honest, I feel terrible.
I mean, I love Andi.
But I think the reason that I got so upset was because I...
I wasn't proud of the way I behaved back then.
I was young and selfish, and I...
I didn't care who I hurt, so, maybe Andi's right about me.
Wow.
Wow.
You just said a lot of really great things at a really unhelpful time.
Okay, look.
I think the question is...
How do we get her to forgive us?
How would I know how to do that?
Okay, Marcy.
Look, it's...
everyone in town knows you hold a hell of a grudge.
Oh, that's nice that people notice.
Yeah, okay, well.
So, if the roles were reversed, what would it take or you to forgive?
Well, talking's not gonna do it.
We need something to let her know that we understand how she feels.
Right?
A big gesture.
Would that by any chance be... a trip to Vegas?
- No.
No.
- Oh.
No.
What I would need is something that would make me feel better, while at the same time, making you feel bad.
You know, preferably, in a public place with a lot of people watching.
Okay?
And on top of that, making a profound statement about the underlying issue that started the problem.
That's all.
Wow.
My brother Don is a saint.
So I told Adam,
I'm gonna go to the parent mixer with someone who's on my team:
Don.
And I misplayed my hand terribly, so I'm here.
Well, this may come as a shock to you, but I was not the most popular person in high school either.
Oh, I believe it.
You seem soft, son.
Oh, my God.
Now we got a party.
Why are you dressed like that?
You... sweet, ridiculous man.
I want to be on Team Sweaty Murphy.
Even though you have really bad uniforms.
Honey, you didn't have to do this.
Yes.
I did.
And believe me, now I understand how you must've felt.
Sweaty... in every area.
And humiliated.
Hey, Jim.
Oh...
Oh... you do get me.
This team sucks.
Take me home.
- Ugh.
- Look what he wore for me.
Is he not the cutest?
Well, we wanted to make a point.
We?
W-We who?
We...
Marcy?
MARCY:
I don't want to do this anymore, Adam!
Marcy!
(leather creaking)
(laughing):
That's the stuff!
ADAM:
Okay, I got my keys,
I got the tickets.
Vegas, here we come!
(laughs)
I got to tell you, I didn't think this would actually happen.
- (chuckles)
- Hey, are we still getting the fake doctor discount?
Yeah.
I just got to write a 90-minute speech about feet.
I got the title.
"Feet:
The Hands of Your Legs."
Okay, guys.
Come on.
We're gonna drop you at Nana's on the way to the airport.
All right.
Daddy, my throat hurts.
What?
No.
No, no, no.
Aw, honey.
Come here.
Oh, Adam.
She's got a fever.
No!
No, no, no.
Yep.
Teddy's warm, too.
Every year.
What are we gonna do?
Uh...
Don't look at me.
I'm a foot doctor.
Goobs, watch your tail.
This guy's level 30 xenomorph.
(gasps) Nice shot, LonerZero!
High five, guys.
Okay, that's it.
We're going fishing next weekend.
And I'm buying you a BB gun.
And this is how you high five.
With another hand.
Good morning, folks. (clears throat)
Von Burns, foot doctor.
Foot specialist.
Footballer, if you will.
Let's break down the word "feet."
From the Latin word "feetatoe."
Ten toes, two feet.
Five toes, one foot.
(Don clears his throat)
I'm gonna let that sink in for the next... 88 minutes.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna walk with my feet to the back bar, get myself a nice little rum and Coke.
These are my feet, right here, ladies and gentlemen.
My feet are walking toward the bar in the back.
Thank you for coming out.
Enjoy the next 88 minutes.
Okay, only six more days till you, me, Andi and Marcy are on a plane to Vegas.

What do you think would have happened if Bill Gates' parents had freaked out about him being a nerd, huh?
There'd be no Angry Birds, I'll tell you that.
I just don't want the other kids to think he's weird and then give him a hard time.
Growing up is tough.
You know, I don't have any personal experience being an outsider, 'cause I've always been hot and athletic.
- Mm-hmm.
- But, um,
- I think Don can relate.
- Mm.
Yeah.
In high school,
Jimmy Dugan used to follow me around and call me a shaved gorilla.
Oh...
Oh, a shaved gorilla.
That's a...
Yeah, well, I was a nerd growing up and it wasn't easy.
You know, you're always saying that, but I am not buying it.
If anything, you were a hot nerd.
Like, uh, like Velma on Scooby-Doo.
Ah, you think so, huh?
Oh, yeah.
When you wear your reading glasses...
All right...
Well, that's because I didn't go to the same high school as the three of you.
Okay, I am gonna tell you guys something
I have never told anyone before.
My freshman year...
You slept with a teacher?
You got a boob job?
Why is no one else guessing?
Okay, I had just moved here from Virginia and I hadn't made many friends.
I thought, "I'm gonna make a big splash at the homecoming game."
So, I go to the mall.
And there, in the window, is a leather suit.
Okay?
Just like the one Eddie Murphy wore in his stand-up special.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
It was shiny, skintight and bright red.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
And I spent all my babysitting money on it 'cause I thought...
"With this suit, I can't lose."
I hope this works out for her.
You're not good with tone, are you?
Yeah,
I realized my mistake as soon as I hit the bleachers.
You see... leather makes a sound.
It's a sound that-that makes people stop and stare.
Why do I know this story?
And that's when I started to sweat.
A lot.
And then, a cheerleader from the other school saw me in my Eddie Murphy suit and she flipped her little ponytail at me and she said,
"Oh, hey, look, it's... "
- Sweaty Murphy.
- Sweaty Murphy.
What?
But how did you know that?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're Sweaty Murphy?
I played in that game.
We talked about you in the huddle.
We laughed so hard, they threw a flag.
No, no, no, no, the only way you would know that is if...
Oh, my God.
You're the girl with the ponytail.
Oh!
And you're the girl in the suit, this is so funny!
You don't think it's funny.
Well, I'm just glad you're okay, because word on the street was that Sweaty Murphy went crazy and ended up in a home somewhere.
Yeah, my home.
I can't believe I married Sweaty Murphy!
It's not funny.
It's a little funny.
Funny.
I can't believe we have been friends all these years and that was you.
You are not really mad about this, are you?
It was years ago.
No, no, I'm not mad.
I mean, I guess I would have recognized you sooner, but your hair's too thin for a ponytail now.
Oh, yeah, I said it.
Don, car.
No, no, no, don't bother leaving,
I'm going upstairs.
Wow.
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad none of that was Marcy's fault.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm just practicing for the car ride home.
Ah...
Oh, boy.
How was your night?
Bad.
Marcy wanted to talk.
I spent years training her not to depend on me for emotional support.
That's all out the window!
After you guys left,
Andi went off about Marcy.
She went through all the English curse words, then started swearing in Portuguese like her grandmother.
This Vegas trip is starting to feel very shaky.
Oh, don't even say that.
I need this trip.
All year, I've been working in this dump...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is our business.
I'm sorry, you know I love this place, but the thought of Vegas is the only thing that gets me through the day in this hellhole.
Look, I want to go, too.
But I don't think it's gonna happen, unless Marcy apologizes.
Well, there's two things Marcy never does:
one of them, she did before we got married and then she stopped.
The one you're talking about, she's never done.
Well, we got to figure out a way to talk her into it.
Yeah, I'll be fine.
You know, it's been so long, I don't even miss it anymore.
Oh, you mean the other thing.
You want me to apologize?
That's a great idea.
Adam, you know I love Andi.
She's one of my best friends, but she totally overreacted.
All right, between you and me,
I totally agree.
Also between you and me, I never said that.
She also said a very hurtful thing to me.
My hair is thick and luxurious, right, Don?
Like a yak's chest, baby.
Thank you.
Well, look, Marcy, you are a very powerful woman.
Like a yak!
Okay, uh, Don here is a shell of a man, so job well done.
But with that power comes responsibility.
You have the opportunity now to be the bigger person.
Hmm.
Appealing to my vanity, I like it.
Okay, I'll do it.
Yes!
Great.
This'll mean a lot to Andi.
Oh, and when you do it, if she starts talking in Portuguese, just power through, that's all compliments.
There she is.
Surprise!
Look who came to see you.
Hello, Marcy.
That was in English, that's a good sign.
So, Andi, I just wanted to say...
Oh, you know what?
Nothing you say can change what happened.
All right?
I mean, all these years, I have regretted not thinking of the perfect comeback for when you called me "Sweaty Murphy"... but I see now that I'm not small and mean like you.
I don't have to blow out other people's candles to make mine shine brighter.
I saw that on a poster in the dentist's office,
I thought it was quite something.
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what?
I cannot believe that you are still upset about something that happened when we were kids!
It's kind of crazy.
Who are you calling crazy, doll hair?
- Oh!
- Okay, okay, okay,
I think we're moving in the wrong direction here.
Honey, Marcy came over to apologize.
No, no, I am not apologizing anymore.
She's completely overreacting again.
Overreact... uh.
A-Are you hearing this?
Do you think I'm overreacting?
Me?
Uh... do I think you're overreacting?
She's looking right at you.
Everyone in the room knows she's talking to you.
Adam?
Well, you are reacting.
And it's definitely not too little.
It's... well, there's underreacting.
Right?
Then there's regular reacting.
You know.
Then there's, uh... you.
That means over!
I never said it!
All right.
I gave it a shot, Adam.
I'm out.
Don, car.
I never get to stay anywhere.
I can't believe you didn't back me up.
Come on, Andi.
I always have your back.
I just don't think that something that happened in high school should cause all these problems today.
Because you turned out awesome.
Well, yeah.
I am pretty great.
You know, but it was a long road to get here.
When she said,
"Don, car," I guess she meant,
"Don, I'm taking the car."
Okay, well, good.
I'm glad you're back, because you can help me.
Okay, don't you think everybody would be better off if Andi just let this go?
Be the bigger person, and just forgive Marcy.
Yeah, I-I mean, I did that to the guy from high school who used to call me a shaved gorilla.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Wait, you're not just making this up as you go along?
- No.
- 'Cause I need something good here.
No.
I-It's a nice story, actually.
Couple years ago, he came to me looking for a job, and I took that opportunity to be the bigger man.
I told him to go to hell.
How does that make you the bigger man?
Well, he's like five-seven.
I'm way bigger.
I knew it.
All the parts of a good story, but still useless.
Don, why are you on his side?
You were a nerd in high school, too, and he doesn't get it.
I get it.
Oh, really?
Have you ever been so desperate to get out of a leather suit that you broke the zipper?
And then your dad had to cut you out with an electric carving knife?
Okay.
To be fair, that's a really small club.
You know, now that I think about it,
Adam sailed through high school.
He was always the winner, always popular.
Okay.
Look, I can't help it if people are drawn to me.
I'm... magnetic.
I don't know.
Life's been easy for you, hasn't it?
It's... it's been a good run, yeah.
Well, you remember at dinner, when I told you they called me a shaved gorilla?
He laughed.
Oh, no.
I do remember that.
It's a funny idea.
I mean, picture a gorilla.
Then, you shave him.
You never see that.
You know,
I think I'm on Andi's side now.
And I don't think she overreacted at all.
I think you underreacted.
You're an underreactor.
You are on the right side of history, Don.
What?
What is happening here?
Now you got him nuts?
Just because of one day, like, a million years ago?
Adam, it wasn't just one day.
I mean, people called me Sweaty Murphy for months.
All right?
Even my homeroom teacher.
She'd do roll call in the morning, she'd be, like,
"Murphy," comma, "Sweaty?"
And I'd have to be, like, "Here."
Oh.
Okay.
I didn't know any of that.
I think it's time you leave, Adam.
It's my house, Don.
Well, it looks like you win again, doesn't it?
Hey, Marcy.
Why are you here?
Apparently, I'm on your team, now.
Oh, ho, ho.
We're gonna be unstoppable!
What?
No...
No!
It's not good.
So how do you want to get 'em?
Okay, we're getting them.
Look, Andi is really upset.
And now, she's got Don all worked up, too.
She even took him to the school-parent mixer tonight, instead of me, because he's on her team.
I had no idea this would be such a big deal to her.
Okay, look.
I don't think either one of us really understood her point of view before, because she's right.
We haven't gone through it.
And I definitely didn't handle things the way I should've.
Well, to be honest, I feel terrible.
I mean, I love Andi.
But I think the reason that I got so upset was because I...
I wasn't proud of the way I behaved back then.
I was young and selfish, and I...
I didn't care who I hurt, so, maybe Andi's right about me.
Wow.
Wow.
You just said a lot of really great things at a really unhelpful time.
Okay, look.
I think the question is...
How do we get her to forgive us?
How would I know how to do that?
Okay, Marcy.
Look, it's...
everyone in town knows you hold a hell of a grudge.
Oh, that's nice that people notice.
Yeah, okay, well.
So, if the roles were reversed, what would it take or you to forgive?
Well, talking's not gonna do it.
We need something to let her know that we understand how she feels.
Right?
A big gesture.
Would that by any chance be... a trip to Vegas?
- No.
No.
- Oh.
No.
What I would need is something that would make me feel better, while at the same time, making you feel bad.
You know, preferably, in a public place with a lot of people watching.
Okay?
And on top of that, making a profound statement about the underlying issue that started the problem.
That's all.
Wow.
My brother Don is a saint.
So I told Adam,
I'm gonna go to the parent mixer with someone who's on my team:
Don.
And I misplayed my hand terribly, so I'm here.
Well, this may come as a shock to you, but I was not the most popular person in high school either.
Oh, I believe it.
You seem soft, son.
Oh, my God.
Now we got a party.
Why are you dressed like that?
You... sweet, ridiculous man.
I want to be on Team Sweaty Murphy.
Even though you have really bad uniforms.
Honey, you didn't have to do this.
Yes.
I did.
And believe me, now I understand how you must've felt.
Sweaty... in every area.
And humiliated.
Hey, Jim.
Oh...
Oh... you do get me.
This team sucks.
Take me home.
- Ugh.
- Look what he wore for me.
Is he not the cutest?
Well, we wanted to make a point.
We?
W-We who?
We...
Marcy?
I don't want to do this anymore, Adam!
Marcy!
That's the stuff!
Okay, I got my keys,
I got the tickets.
Vegas, here we come!
I got to tell you, I didn't think this would actually happen.
Hey, are we still getting the fake doctor discount?
Yeah.
I just got to write a 90-minute speech about feet.
I got the title.
"Feet:
The Hands of Your Legs."
Okay, guys.
Come on.
We're gonna drop you at Nana's on the way to the airport.
All right.
Daddy, my throat hurts.
What?
No.
No, no, no.
Aw, honey.
Come here.
Oh, Adam.
She's got a fever.
No!
No, no, no.
Yep.
Teddy's warm, too.
Every year.
What are we gonna do?
Uh...
Don't look at me.
I'm a foot doctor.
Goobs, watch your tail.
This guy's level 30 xenomorph.
Nice shot, LonerZero!
High five, guys.
Okay, that's it.
We're going fishing next weekend.
And I'm buying you a BB gun.
And this is how you high five.
With another hand.
Good morning, folks.
Von Burns, foot doctor.
Foot specialist.
Footballer, if you will.
Let's break down the word "feet."
From the Latin word "feetatoe."
Ten toes, two feet.
Five toes, one foot.
I'm gonna let that sink in for the next... 88 minutes.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna walk with my feet to the back bar, get myself a nice little rum and Coke.
These are my feet, right here, ladies and gentlemen.
My feet are walking toward the bar in the back.
Thank you for coming out.
Enjoy the next 88 minutes.

Hey, have you seen my brother around?

- Yeah, Kevin.
Thought he was off the sauce.
He is.
I just was curious if you'd seen him around.
No, not for a month or more.
How about you, you want a taste?
Oh, maybe later.
Is that a promise or a tease?

Hey.
You haven't, for any reason, seen either one of my brothers, have you?

Jesus.
Did you have a rough day?
And night, and day before that, and night before that.
I just worked a triple.
Thirty-six on.
You okay?

Whoa, shit, sorry.

Uh, no, I can't.

I could have just a quick one.
Hey, Lannie.
Kevin.
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
- All I asked was for you to abide by a few simple rules.
- I know, and I fucked that up.
- What time is it?
- I'm such a fucking idiot...
- Is it not past 10 p.m.?
- It is definitely late.
- What does that mean?
- I know, but...
- What do you know?
I can't be here past 10 p.m., but you have to understand...
True or false?
You were just caught sneaking around the docks, and you maybe saw some things.
True, but you have to understand, sir, I didn't have a choice.
I didn't know where else to go.
Why those?
Yes. [laughs]
See?
Look, this?
This has nothing to do with me trying to have anything to do with your guys, or whatever you got going here.
Listen, let me tell you what happened, okay?
I go to see this guy that I know.
This friend of mine...
Well, of my family's, really.
And I went...
I went...
I went to his house...
Oh, Jesus.
I need your help, sir.
- My help?
- I wanted to go talk to him about why he was treating my family so badly, right?
And it just kind of, like, spun out of control, and...
And...
He's...
He's just lying on the floor, and I don't think he's breathing.
Do not say another word.
- Mr. Gilbert, I need...
- Stop talking.
I have to ask you a favor.
I need you to open your door and step out of my vehicle.
- Mr. Gilbert, please...
- And this conversation never happened.
[door closes]
- Well, how much blow was he doing?
- [chuckles]
- No, yeah.
- Yeah, right.
Who the hell knows?
He was just talking so fast in the message.
I remember that the first time I ever did a bump was with him, and I was in tenth grade.
Homecoming.
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, I remember Danny was so pissed at Eric for getting his little sister, the prom queen, high.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Eric thought it was funny, and Danny didn't talk to him for, like, a week or two.
I didn't know that.
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]
When is the next bus?
Check the board.
There's nothing on the board.
Then I guess you got your answer.
You mean, there's not another bus?
People lie.
Board don't.
You don't have anything going to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?
Sure, I do.
- Well, I'll take a ticket.
- It'll be 4:50.
The ticket's only $4.50?
Sir, the next bus to Jacksonville is 4:50 a.m.
- There's nothing any sooner?
- Where you looking to go?
I'm looking to go north or west.
- Any city in mind?
- Yeah, any city that's north or west.
[man sighs]
I do got Atlanta at 4:00 a.m.,
Charlotte at, uh, 15 past the hour, and Mobile by way of Tallahassee... half past the hour of cinco.
Does any of that wet your whistle, hoss?
[man on PA] ...activity well below the average of 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major storms, suggesting it might be over.
This year a big difference.
The year also introduced...
Okay, wait, wait.
So, Eric called you?
Yeah, but I couldn't answer.
I was dealing with this 80-year-old woman, ruptured spleen.
He sounds really crazy on the message.
It was like he's foaming at the mouth.
He's so mad.
- And he sounds terrified.
- Why?
[sighs] I don't know.
He needs money, he wants to leave town, he wants me to call him.
And so, did you call him?
Of course.
And?
And now he's not answering.
I told him I'm here, so, you know, fuck it.
Yeah, fuck it.
These fucking brothers not answering their fucking phones.
[cell phone buzzing]
That's my mom.
I gotta pee anyway.
- Wait, watch my purse, okay?
- Yeah.
Hey.
I can't find either of them anywhere.
Go to the boatyard, and if he's not there, go to his house, and bring him here.
Mom, how am I supposed to do that?
- I don't care how you do it.
Just do it.
- No.
No.
No.
I've been calling John, I've been looking for Kevin everywhere, nobody's answering their phone, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
- I'm not doing it.
- You do what I tell you.
You do what I tell you, Meg.
You know what?
I am so sick of this shit, I'm not doing it.
Okay?
I'm not.
Meg?
- Meg?
- [beeps]
Hi, Lannie.
Could I have, um, a fucking bottle of tequila, please?
Oh, shit.
[exhales]
[line ringing]
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just wanted to tell you that I love you very much, honey.
I love you and your brother very much.
Always remember that.
Where are you?
Tell Ben that for me, will you?
He's not picking up and his voicemail's full.
Will you do that for me?
Yeah, sure.
Now?
No, you do it in the morning.
You're okay, though?
Just at work.
Just working late, and I was thinking about you, and I want you to know... that I love you very much, kiddo, okay?
I love you very much.
You can go back to sleep now.
Okay.
[John on recording] You've reached John Rayburn.
Please leave a message.
John, where the fuck are you, man?
Come on.
I've been calling you all fucking night.
You need to meet me, all right?
You need to meet me, like, right fucking now.
What the fuck, man?
I don't know what to do, John.
Come on, you gotta call me back, man.
I need you, I really fucking need you now.
I wouldn't call if I didn't.
So, call me back, you fucking prick, come on.
Call me back!

He'll be home soon.
And we'll have new guests and work to do.
Mom, am I gonna have to answer any more questions?
Shh.
You did good, Johnny.
You all did.
Now, shut your eyes and try to get some sleep.
You want?
No.
I gotta go.

You want a ride?

Mm.
See you later.

I really think that he did.
No.
He was upset.
He wasn't himself.
He was furious at Danny.
What does it matter now?
What's done is done.
No, Mom.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Is that Kevin's at Marco's right now, trying... to get him to help us.

Never mind.

Okay.
I mean, just real quick, and forgive me, but how do I know the difference between a bad sunburn and sunstroke?

Everything's fine, I'm just waiting.

Hey, Lannie.
Kevin.
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
- All I asked was for you to abide by a few simple rules.
- I know, and I fucked that up.
- What time is it?
- I'm such a fucking idiot...
- Is it not past 10 p.m.?
- It is definitely late.
- What does that mean?
- I know, but...
- What do you know?
I can't be here past 10 p.m., but you have to understand...
True or false?
You were just caught sneaking around the docks, and you maybe saw some things.
True, but you have to understand, sir, I didn't have a choice.
I didn't know where else to go.
Why those?
Yes.
See?
Look, this?
This has nothing to do with me trying to have anything to do with your guys, or whatever you got going here.
Listen, let me tell you what happened, okay?
I go to see this guy that I know.
This friend of mine...
Well, of my family's, really.
And I went...
I went...
I went to his house...
Oh, Jesus.
I need your help, sir.
- My help?
- I wanted to go talk to him about why he was treating my family so badly, right?
And it just kind of, like, spun out of control, and...
And...
He's...
He's just lying on the floor, and I don't think he's breathing.
Do not say another word.
- Mr. Gilbert, I need...
- Stop talking.
I have to ask you a favor.
I need you to open your door and step out of my vehicle.
- Mr. Gilbert, please...
- And this conversation never happened.
Well, how much blow was he doing?
- No, yeah.
- Yeah, right.
Who the hell knows?
He was just talking so fast in the message.
I remember that the first time I ever did a bump was with him, and I was in tenth grade.
Homecoming.
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, I remember Danny was so pissed at Eric for getting his little sister, the prom queen, high.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Eric thought it was funny, and Danny didn't talk to him for, like, a week or two.
I didn't know that.
When is the next bus?
Check the board.
There's nothing on the board.
Then I guess you got your answer.
You mean, there's not another bus?
People lie.
Board don't.
You don't have anything going to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?
Sure, I do.
- Well, I'll take a ticket.
- It'll be 4:50.
The ticket's only $4.50?
Sir, the next bus to Jacksonville is 4:50 a.m.
- There's nothing any sooner?
- Where you looking to go?
I'm looking to go north or west.

You okay?
- Kev?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh...
- What's up?
- Um, uh...
I'm here...
- Oh, there's ice cream if you want.
- to see if, uh, John...
- It's Scoonie's birthday.
Is John here?
No.
- Hey, Scoonie?
- Hm?
- You, uh, heard from Rayburn?
- Nope.
But his mother called looking for him.
Everything cool?
Yeah, everything is...
Everything is good.
Thanks.
Hey, you ever read The 48 Laws of Power?
Huh?
'Cause everybody in the joint is so into that shit.
Not me, man.
I can't get past the fourth law.
You know what I mean?
Always say less than necessary.
You know, you, you got that down.
I know you're not taking me out here to propose to me.
Or are you?
Are you gonna propose to me?
Come on, man, you wanna swing?
I'll swing with you, I don't give a shit.
Nobody's looking.
Come on.
Wanna get into it?
Come on, I'll pull it out.
Fuck!
I'm doing whatever I can to help him.
Good.
Thank you.
So, we're all squared up, then?
No, Roy.
Not even close.
You know what?
Fuck you.
You're losing everything 'cause you killed your fucking brother, asshole.
Go ahead.
Anything to protect the fucking Rayburn name.
Right?
...70 degrees.
Fort Myers...
Oh, you fucked up but good, son.
The way I see it, you only have two options.
One, you turn yourself in.
That's a guaranteed outcome, checkmate.
Option two, you let me get you some help with this, right now.
73 degrees right now...
Final boarding call...
I can't guarantee it'll all work out, but at least it'll give you a fighting chance to save yourself, your family.
Watch your baby son born, see him grow up.
...boarding call.
Next departure is in two hours.
Wait!
Either path you take, there's no turning back.
Yeah, John, this is Kevin again.
Where the fuck are you, man?
Um...
John.
Come on, I need to talk to you.
Call me back.
Mom is fucking freaking out.
I can't deal with it.
I can meet you wherever you are.
Just call me or text me, okay?
Jesus.
Please...
Time's up.
John, where the fuck are you, man?
Call me ba...
You have to decide, Kevin.
What do you wanna do?
Hmm?

RICHARD:
I know you're looking into Tyler's death and whether there were drugs involved.
The club said you are.
I can't discuss this reference with you, Richard.
It could break causation for Nate, so if you know anything, I need to hear it.
I find there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and commit Nathaniel Baldwin to trial for manslaughter.
You are supposed to be keeping him out of jail, Richard.
I'm not getting locked up!
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.
- Cindi.
- Pearl.
Where's Tyler's jersey?
The Devils' jersey, it's gone.
Yeah...
That was my brother's!
You psycho bitch!
I'm not going back to that shithole.
No way.
Well, where else is there.
Home?
As if.
I'll figure something else out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Flynn, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- BIANCA:
She's 15.
- I know, he's a creep.
- You all good?
- Yeah.
This is right before the time of the fire, from a petrol station two minutes away.
TRACEY:
That's who set fire to Wazim's house?
Has to be.
Who are you?
You mean to say you deliberately arranged extra payments outside the salary cap?
That's all.
No bets, no fixes.
We just wanted Nate.
I had to tell them about Nate, just the salary cap.
Shit.
3x04
I've been informed that the APL has a report alleging that the Northern Devils Football Club was involved in breaching their salary cap to induce Nate Baldwin to re-sign.
I merely wish to confirm there is no direct evidence linking Pax Car Rentals to this allegation, and I'm confident that any investigation...
Great fucking timing!
Fuck this.
As sponsors, we are not privy to any of the financial arrangements the club may enter into with any of its players.
How can he get away with that?
Uh, well, he's choosing his words very carefully.
I mean, the deal was verbal.
Pax itself was never mentioned and he's fighting to keep that company afloat.
But he made a statement.
Well, it depends how much of that statement we did or didn't pass on to the APL.
And, as I'm sure you can imagine, most of Mr King's evidence had to remain confidential in order for us to conduct our investigation.
So those transcripts...
Were considerably redacted for security...
- ...security...
- ..purposes.
I don't want us giving him any favours.
"Ah, thank you, Tony." "Don't mention it, Janet."
Well, why are you helping him?
He's not your father.
No, but he's still yours.
You going to call Richard Stirling about a deal with Nate?
What?
No.
No?
He'd do anything to stop his client facing a jury right now, wouldn't he?
Thug and salary cheat, all over every news feed, and we need Nate talking.
- Thank you.
- We heard the man who forced
Clay Nelson to kill himself inside his house.
Which is why my position will be stronger when Richard calls me.
- What if he doesn't?
- Well, we'll see, right?
Anything else?
Yeah, I went to a Gender Equality in the Public Service breakfast this morning.
Owen Mitchell was telling us how he'd single-handedly raised the ratio of women at the DPP.
I thought that'd get your attention.
Anyway, we got talking and he said there was a change in prosecutors for the Baldwin trial.
And who is it now?
I thought you had a good relationship with the press?
Darling, if this was just dirt on the floor
I could sweep it under the rug.
But unfortunately, the whole bloody house is on fire.
Well, it does make an acquittal even more difficult.
- You do realise that?
- Of course I do!
God, how did this become so hard?
- What?
- Getting Nate into retirement.
- His last year at the club.
- Well, ask Graham King.
I mean, why invest all that money and then hang the club and its star player out to dry?
OK, right now we just need to focus on getting Nate cleared.
That's the main game right now.
What are you doing?
Focusing.
Janet.
Hi.
Please, it's a simple question.
Have you identified the drug Tyler was taking before he was killed?
Is your client willing to tell us the name of the man who gave him an envelope of cash the other day, and everything he knows about match-fixing and gambling?
He might, if he was sure it meant he'd avoid jail.
It's the only chance he has.
No trial is a foregone conclusion, Janet, you know that.
And without the drug, you have little defence.
We both know that too.
So, time's ticking.
Why don't you go and advise your client how to stay out of jail, alright?
When he talks, we'll act.
Oh, and I take it you've heard about the new Crown you'll be opposing?
OWEN:
You've done an excellent job on the brief.
It's so strong, a three-legged dog could win it.
LINA:
Woof.
Lina, if it was at all possible for you to run it, you would be.
And I'll definitely make sure you get all due credit when the time comes.
Owen!
Hi.
Sorry, Lina.
I heard there's been...
there's been a change?
Yes.
- Who?
- LINA:
Guess.
What?
Richard!
How good's this, eh?
Mate against mate.
Ben McMahon.
Yep!
Former colleagues going toe to toe.
Should be fun, right?
Play nice, kids.
- So, you've had quite the rise.
- So have you.
Ah, well, mostly luck.
You know, sheer arse, really.
But you - keep seeing you pop up everywhere, hmm?
Nate Baldwin must be quite the cash cow.
He asked me to represent him, I agreed.
Simple as that.
Yeah, hey.
Hey, not your fault that you do your job, he gets off and reoffends, needs your help again, right?
Of course, you know, that wouldn't happen if the prosecution did their job properly.
Are you including yourself in that assessment?
Well, he's certainly not including me.
Yeah, we probably shouldn't be discussing Nate.
You're absolutely right, especially when everyone else is discussing it.
Doesn't exactly make it easy, right?
- Ben!
- What?
It's just a sledge.
I'll have you know, sledging is a time-honoured tradition in Australian sport.
He can take it.
Let's get a coffee.
BONNIE:
If we track down the arsonist, he'll probably talk, giving us one of two results -
A, he's a free agent hired by Wazim, or B, he's working for the betting syndicate.
- What would you put those odds at?
- An even 50-50.
A 50% chance of getting inside the betting network.
It's still a 50% chance it'll give us nothing.
Well, what's the current plan?
Wait for Nate Baldwin to agree to a deal based on finding a drug we don't know the whereabouts of.
Which we may or may not get in time for it to be of any use.
Sounded better when Janet said it.
That's one, two, three indeterminate variables, and the issue there's obvious.
So in terms of probability, the arsonist lead is more likely to give us a favourable outcome than the drug.
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.
It's just basic probability analysis.
You should pitch it to Janet.
MAXINE:
We don't need to cut deals.
Hey, whatever keeps me out of jail.
Now the sponsor's dumped me in it.
MAXINE (ON RECORDING):
You can't talk to the NCC.
- Do you want to see me go down?
- No.
Well, at the moment, the only way
I'm going to stay outside is if I get hold of that drug, right?
- RICHARD:
Yes.
- And the only chance I've got to get that drug is if I talk to 'em, right?
Well, I don't see any other way, but I'm not totally sure they can get it either.
LUCY:
So where does that leave us, with Nate going to jail?
That's not happening.
What if I got it?
Shit.
Could she get it?
MAXINE:
That's the answer, isn't it?
You see, if I get the drug, he stays out of jail, doesn't have to talk to anyone.
That's problem solved.
Are you sure you can find it?
You worry about your job, Richard, and I'll worry about mine.
OK, we need to track Maxine's phone.
Can I also remind people about the arsonist...
Later!
Just track Maxine, alright?
You think she can get it?
Hard to tell.
- Could just be Maxine shit-talk.
- That is her job.
If she knew exactly where to find it, she'd already have it.
But she knows Eddie Cooke was behind the supplement program for the Devils, like we do.
I bet that's where she's going.
She's wasting her time.
We searched every inch of Continuum and came up empty.
True, but if that drug underpinned the bet on the Devils, it has to be somewhere.
It's too valuable to completely destroy.
But would Eddie just hand over a secret drug to a sports agent?
No, he's going to want to avoid any link between him and the drug.
That'd just kill his business completely.
He's going to want a lot of assurances about anonymity, etc., before he thinks about handing it over to anyone.
But he might, eventually, to stop Nate talking.
Unless we can convince him to hand it to one of us first.
Well, not one of us, obviously.
No, somebody he thinks has absolutely nothing to do with us, like an undercover agent who goes in there as an elite athlete in need of help.
Going to need a pretty good undercover cop to pull that off.
OK, is she?
She's going to Eddie's, isn't she?
Looks like it.
OK, I think he keeps it off-site.
We need to watch these two, see where they go after this.
(SCREEN BEEPS)
MAXINE:
Eddie, please.
Now what's better for you?
Nate in jail, desperate to cut a deal, or Nate at home, free as a bird?
I don't know what Tyler took.
I do.
He did what he was told.
He followed the club rules to the letter because he needed that contract.
He wouldn't have done anything to jeopardise that.
- So whatever he took, he got here.
- I know the sports world, Eddie.
You see a lot of people, they tell me a lot of things, not least my 42 clients, but especially the five Devils.
I'm in the know, you got that?
So cut the crap and give me what you were giving them.
- There's none left.
- (SCOFFS) That's bullshit.
What, a drug that good, that gets the Devils into the semis?
As if you'd run out of that.
We'd get supplied when there was a demand, but with Tyler's death and the NCC strangling us, that demand is gone.
I don't have any left.
Well, get some more.
OK.
I will ask my supplier, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be back, Eddie.
Hello.
Where are they?
Liam's at the sausage sizzle, and Em's at the 70 metre start.
OK, great.
Have you spoken to Zoe yet?
Good luck.
ZOE:
Tom, take your mark back, then fast at the bar!
Hey, Zoe.
- And drive the knee up!
Hey, Janet.
- Hey, how's Emma?
Great.
Yeah, she's loving it.
Liam was too, but his ankle's still not better, so...
Don't talk to me about injuries.
Greta tore her quad last week.
Oh, no, that girl you were coaching?
Six weeks out from Worlds, ranked number two.
Last week, she's looking at a medal, now we're not even sure if she's going to make it.
That must be heartbreaking for her.
Well, yeah.
When you give up six years, stop working, count every calorie.
But I suppose in Liam's world, if he can't run at Zone, I feel sorry for him too.
Oh, don't feel sorry for him.
He's only upset because I wouldn't give him a day off school.
Um, but, look, I was hoping to have a chat, because I'm kind of involved with sport at the moment, in a funny sort of way, and given who you are and what you do,
I was hoping to pick your brains.
Alright, we should grab a drink.
You deserve champers.
You nailed that brief.
Do you remember how much we used to struggle with summaries?
Oh, yeah, practice makes perfect, I guess.
No, I really shouldn't.
I've got to head back and...
Oh, come on, come on.
The bar's just around the corner, isn't it?
- Andy's got the kid, right?
- Amal, yes.
- That's a beautiful name.
- Oh, thanks.
Hey, check this.
- Oh!
- That's my wife, Bella.
- Oh, yeah, we've all seen Bella.
- And that's Remy.
Gorgeous.
I just wish I got to see them more, to be honest.
But I do most of my prep at night, you know, start mapping out my opening addresses, marking up witness statements, lines of interrogation...
You've got a two-year-old and you get all that done at night?
I'm doing well if I brush my teeth.
Well, Bella hasn't gone back to work, so she does most of the hard yards with Remy, you know?
Yeah.
I'm like a "cuddle and kiss goodnight" Dad.
I so need a wife.
- No, I'd do more.
- I wasn't criticising.
No, I'm not defending, I mean it.
I...
I wish I could do more.
I thought you weren't going to lift a finger unless Nate started talking.
Well, things changed.
Other information came to light.
But I need an assurance when we find this drug, Nate will talk.
So that was just a bluff before.
You don't have it.
And if you do find material evidence in a manslaughter trial, you'll have to hand it over anyway.
Well, things do disappear from evidence rooms from time to time.
We think we can keep your client out of jail.
Your job is to buy us the time so we can wrap this up to everyone's satisfaction, without a trial actually starting.
Richard!
How are you, mate?
- Janet?
- Hello, Ben.
Wow!
What's it been, like, four or five years?
- Yeah, something like that.
- You look great.
Thank you, and I hear you're, um... married.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, got all responsible.
Settled down.
The Premier's daughter?
So, isn't it more accurate to say she settled down, you settled up?
I'm joking.
I'm sure there's a lot of love there.
Yeah.
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Ash.
That must have been terrible.
Thank you, yes.
But hey, look how far we've all come, right?
NCC Examiner, barrister, barrister...
Future Nobel Laureate.
- Currently, mother.
- Toughest job you'll ever have.
- Stay in touch, huh?
- Yep.
- It was good to see you, Ben.
- Yeah, likewise.
See you, Janet.
Yep.
- I should go too.
- Oh!
You've gotta be kidding me.
You're having a drink with me.
After the trial might be more appropriate, don't you think?
Let's cross swords first and then once it's all done,
- we can catch up after that.
- Cross swords?
- What sword's he got?
- What sword do you have, seriously?
I mean, I couldn't even find a tooth-pick in the facts that I read.
I'm surprised you're not pleading guilty.
One more.
Come on, my shout.
And we won't mention the case again, will we?
Oh, never.
- So, you look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- You're not nervous?
- Shit, I'd be nervous.
I'd be sweating more than a gypsy with a mortgage, to be honest with you.
I mean, who'd wanna be you right now?
Seriously, major trial, in the public spotlight, up against this one.
With no defence.
You got enough underwear?
(CHUCKLES) Pssh, right?
You're so easy to stir.
Come on, sit down.
I'll see you later.
WAYNE:
So you know Zoe DiCosta?
Oh, I've only met her a couple of times.
Our kids go to Tiny Track together.
Oh, wow.
Have you actually seen her gold medal race?
No, but I should look that up.
She attacked about 6K out, putting about 30 seconds between her and the peloton.
Couple of chasers went after her, but she fended them off.
She was battling a really nasty headwind for the last kay and a half too, so, yeah, it was a really, really gutsy ride.
Sounds impressive.
Yeah, it was, especially as the Spaniard who took the bronze got done for doping two years later.
Really?
Yeah, see, PEDs give you that extra 1% edge, but it doesn't mean much without putting in the 99% hard work first.
Zoe was just mentally tougher.
You've got a similar grunt.
Oh, I wasn't aware I grunted.
Oh, no, no, no, it's a good thing.
Like...
like ticker.
Or hunger.
- Pluck?
- BIANCA:
Zoe's here.
Great.
We know the man running this sports medicine clinic has used a supplement unknown to ASADA.
The question is, what does an undercover cop have to do and say to make him believe they are genuinely from the world of elite sport and then, how to ask for some of this substance?
It's not on the banned list?
No.
What does it do?
Well, we think it speeds up recovery, aids endurance.
God, if it was legal, I'd be queuing up for it now.
Greta'd kill her grandmother to get her hands on the stuff.
- Greta?
- It's one of Zoe's cyclists.
She's a total freak of nature.
VO2 touching 70, threshold 242 and a monster TSS.
- What?
- Training Stress Score.
It's sort of a number that rates your workout.
But unfortunately, she's injured at the moment, right?
Getting over a torn quad, so her normalised power's still down about 5% to 8%, and Worlds are just around the corner.
So, it's a race against time.
Is it ever.
I think we've seen about 11 doctors, tried just about everything.
At this point, if they said, "Take arsenic,"
she probably would.
And risk death?
If it would fix her, probably worth it.
That's the way Greta's thinking.
All those sacrifices.
It's...
Well, yeah.
If I told her I could get her something not on the banned list that could get her to Worlds, she'd beg me for it.
Now, we should get all this down for the cop so that they sound like they've got the right shorthand and describe exactly what they're looking for, sound genuine.
Sure.
I mean, it would also really help if whoever we choose has a background in sport.
You know any former footballers, basketballers, someone like that on the force?
So, you've got no idea what this stuff is?
None.
Just say, for example...
just say I was asking for it,
I wouldn't be asking for a banned substance, right?
No-one's going to suggest that you...
Well, hang on a second.
Let's just think about it for a minute.
I mean, OK, let's say that you...
You never met us, but you'd heard that this guy,
Eddie Cooke, he'd been getting great results and his athletes were passing all the tests.
I'd want to know what it was and where I could get it.
OK, let's say he just gave you something in a bottle.
Even when I was racing, you're mad to take whatever anyone gives you, but you can't be on your guard the whole time.
No, so you would just take it somewhere first, to find out exactly what it was.
If I didn't know what it was, totally, yeah.
I'd have to, for my own reputation.
Right.
I'd happily do that.
I mean, I haven't asked for anything I knew is banned, and if it should be and we end up catching a drug cheat, great.
And if it turned out that it actually did help with recovery, wasn't performance enhancing...
I'd use it.
OK, so let's do it.
Hang on, Janet.
There are procedures and protocols.
We can't...
I wasn't here.
I didn't know any of this was happening.
I told you, there's none left.
Your inaction will mean that Nate Baldwin's going to talk to the Crime Commission, which can't happen, as you well know.
We both have reputations to uphold.
I got it from my supplier,
Flynn and I administered it and now it's all gone.
There's nothing I can do.
You're as useless as a shit-flavoured lollipop, Eddie.
- BIANCA:
Recording.
- OK.
EDDIE (ON RECORDING):
Zoe DiCosta.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- ZOE:
Doctor Cooke.
- EDDIE:
Eddie, please.
Welcome to Continuum.
- Bonnie.
You need to stay on Maxine.
- On it.
What brings you here?
Can I show you around?
I've heard good things, and I need help.
Wondered if you might be able to.
I hope so.
So, what's the problem?
Not sure if you know, but I'm coaching Greta Beckett.
Yeah, yeah.
Time triallist.
Individual pursuit.
I know.
She tore her quad last week.
- Medialis?
- Femoris.
Grade two.
And when are the Worlds?
Six weeks, but if she takes three or four weeks off to recover, her power will drop, and even down 4 or 5 watts, that's...
- First to third.
- Or fourth or even fifth.
We really need a fast recovery.
She's been good with icing?
Compression?
- Yeah.
On top of that.
- Janet?
We managed it well in the beginning, it's just now.
She's got to give herself time to get her threshold back up over 240.
But all the physios are saying another fortnight before she can pedal, and Greta's like,
"Get me back on the bike now."
Then we heard about you, the miracle man.
Have you tried PRPs?
The plasma injections?
Are they really that good?
- They certainly help.
- Full recovery?
She'll take anything, Eddie.
Well, obviously nothing on the banned list.
She still gets out-of-competition tested, but if there's anything else.
Please.
She's given up her life for this.
You know what athletes are like.
I'm sorry, but there's not much else I can offer.
Come on, Zoe.
Come on.
Think of something.
Eddie, if you help Greta win, it'll be your victory too.
And in front of the whole media, I promise, you will get the credit you deserve.
You will be the man who got her back to the starting line, and everyone in the world will know it.
OK.
If I can help, I'll give you a call tomorrow.
She's good.
Mm, they always said she was tough to race.
FLYNN:
No, it's all gone.
Once Tyler died and we found there was something weird about his blood, we binned it all.
I know how you hang out with the stars, their girlfriends, whoever.
And they let you.
Not because you're the fun guy, but because you sell them fun.
Whatever they want, you've got.
Now a drug that gets the Devils from last to fourth, there's got to be other buyers for that, right?
- What's your offer?
- So, you mean you do have it?
One bottle, 20 grand.
Cash.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, but it's incredible stuff.
That's the price.
Take it or leave it.
Alright, I'll take it.
You're a fuckin' little shit.
You're gonna regret this.
You gettin' 20,000 off her?
- Can you loan me a grand?
- Oh, yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
It's to bail my friend Cindi out.
She really needs it.
You staying at home tonight?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
JUDGE WALKER:
Mr Stirling, what is your argument for having this trial not proceed?
Your Honour, the negative publicity surrounding my client's case and his reputation is enormous.
It is inconceivable he can receive a fair trial in the current environment.
And in support of this submission?
Well, yes, Your Honour.
There is considerable evidence from many internet sites that I wish to present to the court.
Your Honour, do we really need to hear all of it?
Social media is not new, Mr Stirling, and the legal system has managed to operate successfully since its inception.
I appreciate that, Your Honour, but the wealth of supporting material forms a compelling basis for my submission.
Your Honour, Nate Baldwin is a very public sports figure.
It would be almost impossible to find a juror in the entire state who had never heard of him.
Indeed, yes.
Even I have heard of him.
Meaning recent coverage is unlikely to have altered anyone's opinion of him.
If cases are to be thrown out on the basis that social media creates unfair trials, well, then nothing would ever be tried in court again.
My instructions to the jury will be to take into account only evidence presented in court, not hearsay outside of it.
Therefore, press coverage cannot unduly influence them.
It is impossible for anyone to forget hearsay.
Are you suggesting I am a biased judge, Mr Stirling?
Of course not, Your Honour.
The request to have the trial not proceed is denied.
Trial will commence tomorrow at 9am.
Your Honour, I would like to make a last-minute request for a judge-only trial.
Your Honour, my learned colleague cannot keep delaying this trial.
Exactly what I was thinking.
It is in the public interest for this trial to be completely above any suspicion of bias, Your Honour.
And given the adverse publicity surrounding the trial...
Objection, Your Honour - it's the same argument.
I am not questioning the clarity or authority of your instructions to the jury, Your Honour, but their ability to adhere to them.
Very well.
Submissions to me by 9am tomorrow.
Well played, mate.
See you tomorrow.
Can't wait.
- Mm.
- Bring it on.
Can't wait for the all-nighter on a judge-only submission.
Well, he shouldn't have demolished the not-proceed option so well.
He's not really enjoying this as much as he looks.
Yes, he is.
You're enjoying it too, right?
I'm warming to it.
(PHONE RINGS) Maxine.
Yes, this is...
- RICHARD: 20,000?
- MAXINE:
Cash.
- Did you see it at Flynn's?
- No, but I'm sure he's got some.
NATE:
Or he might just want to pocket 20 grand.
MAXINE:
We won't know for sure until we turn up with the money.
RICHARD:
Have you got that much?
MAXINE:
Me?
20,000 in cash?
What do I look like, an ATM machine?
What about you?
No!
Well, Nate, we could get that somehow, couldn't we?
It's just... it takes a few days to organise that much.
Right, if we're moving that amount of cash, we've got to make sure the tax office isn't looking at us.
We'll take it out in bits.
OK, just...
look, leave it with me.
I'll sell a few things.
I'll get it together somehow.
Save all our arses, as per.
I thought we were tracking Maxine's phone.
- BIANCA:
We are.
- I am.
So you knew she was seeing Flynn Pearce?
You didn't tell us?
How long until we can get a listening device into Flynn's?
Could take us a day to get the warrant.
OK, forget the warrant.
That'll happen when it happens.
An hour.
OK, do it.
Make sure it's there before she goes back.
But without a warrant, anything we record is...
OK, you just need to shut up, alright?
The one time you should have opened your mouth is the only time in the last six weeks you've kept it closed.
In case it escaped your attention, which for an analyst there is absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here.
Against time, a manslaughter trial and Maxine Reynolds.
She buys that drug, presents it to the court, gets Nate off, we're back to square one.
That's what's at stake here and you've just put all of that in jeopardy!
I'm sorry.
I was...
OK, what were you doing?
No, no, let me guess.
You were still trying to figure out the identity of the arsonist because you decided that was the priority, not locating the drug.
You are not running your own reference here.
You are part of a team and I am the one who dictates the direction of it, not you.
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're the smartest person in the room.
You're not.
Out.
LUCY:
Richard.
Can you just... just tell me, and be honest - what are his chances?
Maxine finding that drug could make all the difference, providing Flynn isn't ripping her off.
Right.
If he gets locked up, I have no money.
I have nothing.
Well, this isn't a crime that they seize assets for.
You'd still have your bank accounts, your credit cards...
I don't have any.
I don't even have this betting account that's supposedly mine.
I wish.
I mean I get my bags, make-up, shoes, all from my sponsors, who are all dumping me quick smart.
You've never had your own money?
Oh, because I'm a typical WAG who sponges off her husband and goes to the opening of an envelope?
No, no, no.
Of course not.
Do you know how we met?
In a taxi rank.
Nate had been to some do and I'd had a Mozart recital.
You like classical music?
I play it.
I went to the Conservatorium of Music.
Look...
Nate takes care of everything for me.
He looks after me.
You might want to make alternative arrangements, just in case.
He won't do that.
I'll see if I can talk some sense into him.
Thank you.
We should be online in Flynn's place now.
Want me to check?
Yes, thank you.
PEARL:
Cindi needs me.
- FLYNN:
Yeah, well, I need you.
PEARL:
No, you don't know what she's going through.
It's really messed up.
Welfare overpaid her and she owes 'em a grand she doesn't have and she can't get her benefits until she's paid it back.
You sure you can't help?
I'm not a charity, Pearl.
Come on, why don't...
why don't you just chill out?
We can relax.
The guy that killed my brother goes on trial tomorrow.
I want to have a drink with my friend.
Sure.
You want to see Cindi, go see Cindi.
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
I just thought you needed a place to stay, that's all.
I mean, if you don't, fine, go.
I'm not keeping you locked up.
But if you go now don't come back here.
OK.
What do you want to do?
I want you to take your clothes off.
We can have some fun, yeah?
We don't have the warrant in place, do we?
No.
Good girl.
Good girl.
OK.
I've heard enough.
Uh, don't forget to argue the strengths of the Westminster system.
Andy, what about your mum?
Can she pick Amal up?
Richard's just dropped an application for judge-only on us.
You know how it's underpinned by a belief juries take their responsibilities very seriously.
No, my brother can't.
His car's getting repaired.
Study after study shows this to be the case.
Yeah, well, I'll call you back in five.
OWEN:
Just thought I'd check in and see how you're both doing.
All good.
Yeah, we're on top of it.
You go.
We were just finishing up.
I don't want to lose another case with a high-profile sportsman.
We won't, but we could find a few more arguments.
No, we've got it with what you've given me.
You go see your daughter, right?
Give her a cuddle from me.
Uh, crossed wires with Andy about childcare.
First time for everything, right?
Right.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
AMAL:
Mummy.
Yeah.
Did you give her something for the pain?
Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to work.
Oh, bub - those horrible toothy-pegs still hurting?
Oh, come here.
- Hey, you've got court tomorrow.
- Go to bed.
Yeah, it is tomorrow.
I just want to make sure I've got all the points in my head.
Well, it's no good if your head's asleep on the bench.
Well, I don't want Ben or Owen to think I'm not across it.
Oh, as if they would.
I've had to leave early a couple of times.
Oh, I...
I'd change my shifts but I've got three men on stress leave.
It's fine.
I can manage, Andy.
Hey, uh you don't have to prove anything to anyone, OK?
You're doing a brilliant job.
Owen says so, Ben says so, I think so.
You stop doubting yourself.
WAYNE:
Got a visual on Cooke again.
And someone's not too happy with him.
Mitchell Douglas, the coach of the Devils.
Now he's getting into his car.
Alone.
Didn't appear to be carrying anything.
Oh, he's heading south.
Bay Road.
- JANET:
Stay on him.
- Rightio.
He's going to Flynn's.
He's going to get the drug.
- Confident.
- Where's Maxine?
Heading to the bank again.
She got 9 grand out yesterday.
And Flynn?
Still snoring.
Pearl's left for court.
The warrant's in place, so whatever we hear now is admissible, but we still need...
That statement from Pearl.
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thanks.
JOURNALIST:
How do you think you'll go today?
Will the Devils release you from your contract?
No comment.
Please, can you give us some space?
(QUIETLY) Should be here by this afternoon.
- Tomorrow at the latest.
- Viki!
Ms Perati, do you have any comment?
My son was taken from me by that monster who pretended to be his friend.
MITCHELL:
You're sure you don't need me in there?
Yeah.
Look, Nate's got a temper, but he's not the monster they're making him out to be.
- OK?
He looked out for Ty.
- This isn't fair.
You weren't a witness.
I've got to do something to help make it right, OK?
One of our boys has died.
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry, Mitchell.
- Any news?
- Close.
I believe we're very close.
Hi, Pearl.
Um, bit crazy, isn't it?
You want to get away from here?
- We'll have a chat?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Your Honour, the Westminster system is underpinned by the fact that juries take their responsibilities extremely seriously.
I mean, the average citizen is perfectly capable of putting hearsay and personal bias aside and paying serious attention to the facts presented.
Your belief in the process is commendable.
Your Honour, news feeds and social media are awash with damning indictments of the accused.
Now, this is far from normal hearsay and only a trained legal mind, such as Your Honour's, can truly ignore this bias and consider the facts, as you said yesterday.
Therefore, by your own argument, you are the only person entitled to hear this trial.
Well argued, Mr Stirling.
But don't ever try it again.
Yes, Your Honour.
I agree to the request made by Mr Stirling for a judge-only trial.
Now, gentlemen, can we declare a ceasefire and get on with this?
JANET:
This must be a difficult day for you.
I can understand why you don't want to be in there, hear everything that happened.
I don't need to.
He's guilty.
He hit Ty.
They'll lock him up and then...
And then?
There'll be justice.
For Ty.
And what about you?
Don't you deserve justice?
I'm alright.
It's pretty clear what the arrangement is with Flynn.
He's 28 years old.
You're underage.
You can't legally give consent to have...
Piss off!
I can give consent whenever I want.
Don't act like this isn't my choice.
- It's... it's my life.
- It's a crime, Pearl.
In six months, it won't be.
I can get public housing on my own.
What, so sexual abuse is the price you're willing to pay for a roof over your head?
There are better options.
Yeah?
Like share houses?
You ever been in one?
Full of junkies who just take all your shit?
Or I could go back home, to Mum getting shitfaced and laying into me.
And Kevin.
Or I could, uh... sleep in a gutter or a shop door.
You think that'd be better?
Of course not, but there has to be something else, yeah?
Something better than Flynn.
There's not, but.
That's it, you see?
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.
He can help out my friend Cindi.
She's worse off than me.
I figured out a way.
I'm making it work.
It's my choice, not yours.
Pearl...
Hard copies of all the surveillance on Maxine and Eddie.
Uh, thanks, but Wayne's on Eddie.
Of course, but just in case you need to cross-reference their movements.
OK.
Yeah, sure.
It's what I do.
I'm thorough, meticulous, on-task, 24/7, analysing data, which, to be effective, requires a broad scope.
So while my focus may appear to shift at times, it's only because every piece of information needs to be studied exhaustively.
I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't.
You should probably be explaining this to Janet.
I think it helps if the chief investigator also appreciates the particular demands of an analyst.
So I can put in a good word for you, you mean?
Oh, no.
It's just...
I get data, look for patterns.
It's puzzle solving with a real-world impact and I think it's a buzz and...
Yeah.
Bonnie, I'm kind of busy right...
Am I getting fired?
What?
Bonnie, you stuffed up.
We all do.
Just get over it and move on.
JANET:
Put Wayne on.
WAYNE:
He's gone into a chemist.
Cartwrights, Lavender Street, Granville.
Why go halfway across town to a chemist?
They're old friends and he gets a discount?
Or maybe Eddie's supplying him with peds.
Unlikely.
He's a cleanskin, according to this.
Owned by Lionel Cartwright.
Pharmacy degree, compounding chemist of 25 years.
No priors, nothing.
Eddie's on the move.
Could be in for more action now.
He's just arrived at Flynn's.
So, what did the chemist have to do with this?
We can pick up Eddie inside.
Keep a visual on him if you can, Wayne.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
EDDIE:
I told you to get rid of it.
FLYNN:
You know what I can get for it.
I've got a better offer.
Technically you stole it from me.
OK, I'll give you a cut.
I need it now.
How much have you got?
50ml.
I kept one bottle, that's all.
As soon as he's outside, Wayne can grab Eddie...
And risk Eddie smashing it on the road?
Losing everything?
No, let it run all the way to Zoe's.
Then we can look after it properly.
Great.
Much safer strategy.
That wasn't meant to sound patronising, honestly.
Just... genuine.
No offence.
BEN:
Could you show the court what you saw when the accused hit the victim?
It was like this, to the side of Ty's face.
He stumbled, fell backwards.
MITCHELL:
Try to say something, mate.
Come on!
Come on, mate.
Ty?
So he was hit hard enough to be knocked over?
Well, yeah.
I guess so.
No further questions, Your Honour.
When the victim fell, did you hear the accused say anything?
Yeah, he said, "Sorry, mate,"
and when Ty didn't get back up, he said, "I didn't hit him that hard".
He kept saying it.
- Did you believe him?
- Yeah.
So, it's possible the blow wasn't hard enough to make the victim fall?
Yeah, maybe.
Only a...
Only what, Mr Metcalf?
Only I just remembered Tyler didn't trip.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
He was lunging forward at the time, trying to grab the phone with the pictures.
One of them got that drug yet?
Maxine?
What's-her-face?
Anyone?
Look, what if I talk to 'em?
The NCC?
I don't think it'd make a difference now.
So, what's the plan from here?
I think Richard's going to call Nate as a witness.
What?
It's a chance for the judge to hear firsthand your relationship with the victim.
And risk us trapping him into saying something he shouldn't?
Why you'd never have laid into him with full force.
I thought you said you don't normally do that?
Well, he's got nothing else.
We've got no choice.
And I think you could really help yourself.
And you know Richard.
Never say die.
He'll find some angle.
He'll try and counter Nate's public image.
It'll all be about tearing down the aggro and the thuggery and showing his warm, caring side.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Well, this is Richard.
Whatever he's got will be carefully thought-out.
You think he's still got a chance?
It's still Nate Baldwin.
If we get him angry, he'll undo everything.
MAXINE:
What the fuck do you mean you don't have it?
FLYNN:
I mean it was for sale, and now it's been sold.
Who to?
Was it Eddie?
Fuckin' lying sack of shit.
It was a private sale.
Do you know you have had me running all around town.
I have grabbed cash every way I know how because we had a deal.
Now tell me who the hell has the drug now!
No.
You're fuckin' dead, Mr Pearce.
You're dead.
(DOOR SLAMS)
So, according to your expert analysis of the deceased's autopsy and toxicology report, could you explain for the court what the cause of death was?
A subdural haematoma.
That is, bleeding which fills the brain area rapidly, compressing brain tissue.
And what caused that haematoma?
A serious blow to the head.
A large contusion on the side of the face corresponded to where the deceased was struck.
And that was the only cause of the bleeding?
There were some anomalies in the reports regarding the failure of the deceased's blood to coagulate properly.
The cause of that was not possible to determine.
Was it a contributing factor to the death of Mr Perati?
I couldn't categorically state that, no.
Nothing further.
EDDIE:
I think this might be able to help you.
ZOE:
Thanks.
2ml daily, top thigh.
Four or five days should do the trick.
And there's no chance of it testing positive?
Lots of guys were on it last year.
Passed everything.
Well, in that case, when Greta wins a medal, we'll know who to thank.
Tell the lab to be on stand-by.
We need this tested as soon as possible.
We have to be sure it's the substance that killed Tyler.
JUDGE WALKER:
Your witness, Mr Stirling.
That's not a phone, is it, Mr Stirling?
Mr Stirling!
Your Honour, I wish to apply for an adjournment, because my instructions have been compromised.
Compromised in what way, Mr Stirling?
My client has said something that is difficult to interpret.
You mean, he wishes to change his plea?
Your Honour, I've received mixed messages and need a private audience with my client to confirm his instructions.
If we could adjourn for the rest of the day...
Your Honour, my learned colleague only needs a minute to ask his client what he meant.
A couple of hours to advise my client calmly, ensure he understands the entirely of the situation is not unreasonable.
There are a lot of grey areas in this case.
Including the hairs you're putting on my head, Mr Stirling.
You have an hour.
So I get the cash together,
I go there and then he says he doesn't have it anymore.
I just don't know what to do.
So how's it looking your end, Richard?
Sorry, gotta go.
Oh, shit.
- Have you got it?
- Still waiting for the lab results.
If it's not here in 20 minutes, I've got to put Nate on the stand.
Well, you can stretch that out.
Go back to his childhood, his love for the game.
You used to hate it when the defence resorted to sob stories for a win.
Well, there's an exception for everything.
Good luck.
NATE:
I met Tyler a couple of years ago.
He'd just been spotted in a schoolboys' team and he got into a clinic the Devils run for up-and-coming players.
I gave him some tips.
I could tell how keen he was, you know - that hunger to make it.
Anyway, he got signed on and, yeah, we hung out a bit.
You mentor a lot of younger players.
What made Tyler special?
He told me he didn't have a dad, so I, um... you know, I just...
I looked out for him, gave him advice.
He never really talked about it, but I could tell the pressure that he was under to make first grade 'cause of what that meant for his family.
The money.
I knew they were doing it tough and, you know, they counted on him to take care of them.
You're successful, wealthy.
How could you really know what that was like?
Well, I know that pressure.
An injury or something can end your career in a flash and suddenly...
suddenly you've got nothin'.
So, you've gotta work your guts out to stay at the top of your form.
I know how much training and sacrifice that takes.
I've lived it.
I saw Ty live it.
I knew exactly what he wanted, 'cause it's what I've always wanted and I would never, ever have done anything to take that away from him.
BEN:
So you had a real connection with him?
What?
Well, you and Tyler.
You obviously had a common bond.
We were good mates, yeah.
I mean, it sounded a lot more than that to me.
I'd imagine you get to know your fellow teammates pretty well in that locker room...
Objection, Your Honour.
Relevance.
Your Honour, I'm merely wanting to establish the intimate bonds of male teammates, which some may describe as homoerotic.
Homo what?
And the bond between Nate Baldwin and Tyler Perati, which was clearly on and off the field...
Hey, fuck off!
It wasn't like that!
I'm not gay.
You can't...
you can't say that shit to me!
Objection.
This is assuming a fact not in evidence, Your Honour.
No, look, I'm just saying you've got no right to imply something like that.
Sustained.
Thank you, Mr Crown.
Withdrawn, Your Honour.
I did nothin'...wrong.
I didn't even hit him that hard.
I know I didn't.
Hey.
News?
The lab's just emailed the results.
Oh, what?
What's happening?
H2O.
- It was water.
- What?
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.
But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?
CINDI:
Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?
What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?
- He won't.
- Whoever he sells it to will.
Serves 'em both right.
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?
Mate, Flynn was askin' 20.
What is it?
Who cares?
I found someone to buy it, that's all that matters.
When's he comin'?
Soon.
And if he doesn't turn up, there's plenty of other contacts in Flynn's phone.
And we can pay off your debt and you'll be sweet.
We could, like, get our own place and stuff, just you and me.
Fuck, it'd be so cool.
Hey, what are you doing?
It's a 20,000 trip.
You know, as if I'm not gonna try that.
- Don't be stupid.
- Oh, it'd be stupid not to!
- Cindi, for fuck's sake!
- No, I need that money.
Stop!
Look, he won't even notice.
(COUGHS AND LAUGHS)
Mr Baldwin.
The emotional impact of your evidence was considerable.
The bond you shared with the victim was obviously deeply felt and genuine.
Your role as a mentor and father-figure in his life is without question.
However, the strength of your relationship cannot alter the facts presented by the autopsy and toxicology reports.
The large bruise on the deceased's body directly corresponds with the blow with which you struck him, and the size of the bruise indicates the force behind it.
I find no other contributing factors to his death, other than the punch, and so on one count of manslaughter,
I find you guilty.
Sentencing to take place at a date to be determined.
Please remove the prisoner.
(CAMERAS CLICK)
OK, although I usually don't comment on verdicts,
I am aware of recent public concern about decisions made by the DPP.
I have no doubt today's outcome will restore public confidence in the DPP and I would especially like to acknowledge the team responsible for preparing such a strong case to present to court, led by Ben McMahon.
Maybe it was Flynn.
Maybe he swapped the real drug for water.
But he's been pissed off all day, because he thinks he's lost 20 grand.
Did Eddie give Zoe the wrong bottle?
Like, an accident.
It was unlabelled.
After he went to so much trouble to get it for her?
It's unlikely.
Was Eddie onto us?
Is that possible?
Then, why go through the whole charade of giving her anything?
Why not just say no the first time she asked for it?
He's an arrogant bastard?
Was Eddie Cooke playing us?
And if he was, how involved is he in the whole thing?
(CRASH!
) (TYRES SCREECH, GLASS SHATTERS)
Does all this link back to Eddie?
Help, somebody!
Please help!
You're alright.
Come on.
Help, somebody!
Help!
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)
Somebody, come on, help us!
That bottle is a critical piece of evidence in a national investigation.
Now, if you want to get arrested, fine, run off.
If not, just give it to me!
I could be in here for 12 years!
I can't do it.
I've gotta spill my guts to the NCC.
That'll knock some time off.
No, not happening.
You tell them nothing.
Could Maxine be the head of the whole syndicate?
Well, that would mean she's let her own client go to jail over a drug that propped up her betting plunges.
Interesting business model.
We're too late.
I know you're looking into Tyler's death and whether there were drugs involved.
The club said you are.
I can't discuss this reference with you, Richard.
It could break causation for Nate, so if you know anything, I need to hear it.
I find there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and commit Nathaniel Baldwin to trial for manslaughter.
You are supposed to be keeping him out of jail, Richard.
I'm not getting locked up!
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.
- Cindi.
- Pearl.
Where's Tyler's jersey?
The Devils' jersey, it's gone.
Yeah...
That was my brother's!
You psycho bitch!
I'm not going back to that shithole.
No way.
Well, where else is there.
Home?
As if.
I'll figure something else out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Flynn, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She's 15.
- I know, he's a creep.
- You all good?
- Yeah.
This is right before the time of the fire, from a petrol station two minutes away.
That's who set fire to Wazim's house?
Has to be.
Who are you?
You mean to say you deliberately arranged extra payments outside the salary cap?
That's all.
No bets, no fixes.
We just wanted Nate.
I had to tell them about Nate, just the salary cap.
Shit.
3x04
I've been informed that the APL has a report alleging that the Northern Devils Football Club was involved in breaching their salary cap to induce Nate Baldwin to re-sign.
I merely wish to confirm there is no direct evidence linking Pax Car Rentals to this allegation, and I'm confident that any investigation...
Great fucking timing!
Fuck this.
As sponsors, we are not privy to any of the financial arrangements the club may enter into with any of its players.
How can he get away with that?
Well, he's choosing his words very carefully.
I mean, the deal was verbal.
Pax itself was never mentioned and he's fighting to keep that company afloat.
But he made a statement.
Well, it depends how much of that statement we did or didn't pass on to the APL.
And, as I'm sure you can imagine, most of Mr King's evidence had to remain confidential in order for us to conduct our investigation.
So those transcripts...
Were considerably redacted for security...
- ...security...
- ..purposes.
I don't want us giving him any favours.
"Thank you, Tony." "Don't mention it, Janet."
Well, why are you helping him?
He's not your father.
No, but he's still yours.
You going to call Richard Stirling about a deal with Nate?
What?
No.
No?
He'd do anything to stop his client facing a jury right now, wouldn't he?
Thug and salary cheat, all over every news feed, and we need Nate talking.
- Thank you.
- We heard the man who forced
Clay Nelson to kill himself inside his house.
Which is why my position will be stronger when Richard calls me.
- What if he doesn't?
- Well, we'll see, right?
Anything else?
Yeah, I went to a Gender Equality in the Public Service breakfast this morning.
Owen Mitchell was telling us how he'd single-handedly raised the ratio of women at the DPP.
I thought that'd get your attention.
Anyway, we got talking and he said there was a change in prosecutors for the Baldwin trial.
And who is it now?
I thought you had a good relationship with the press?
Darling, if this was just dirt on the floor
I could sweep it under the rug.
But unfortunately, the whole bloody house is on fire.
Well, it does make an acquittal even more difficult.
- You do realise that?
- Of course I do!
God, how did this become so hard?
- What?
- Getting Nate into retirement.
- His last year at the club.
- Well, ask Graham King.
I mean, why invest all that money and then hang the club and its star player out to dry?
OK, right now we just need to focus on getting Nate cleared.
That's the main game right now.
What are you doing?
Focusing.
Janet.
Hi.
Please, it's a simple question.
Have you identified the drug Tyler was taking before he was killed?
Is your client willing to tell us the name of the man who gave him an envelope of cash the other day, and everything he knows about match-fixing and gambling?
He might, if he was sure it meant he'd avoid jail.
It's the only chance he has.
No trial is a foregone conclusion, Janet, you know that.
And without the drug, you have little defence.
We both know that too.
So, time's ticking.
Why don't you go and advise your client how to stay out of jail, alright?
When he talks, we'll act.
And I take it you've heard about the new Crown you'll be opposing?
You've done an excellent job on the brief.
It's so strong, a three-legged dog could win it.
Woof.
Lina, if it was at all possible for you to run it, you would be.
And I'll definitely make sure you get all due credit when the time comes.
Owen!
Hi.
Sorry, Lina.
I heard there's been...
there's been a change?
Yes.
- Who?
- Guess.
What?
Richard!
How good's this?
Mate against mate.
Ben McMahon.
Yep!
Former colleagues going toe to toe.
Should be fun, right?
Play nice, kids.
- So, you've had quite the rise.
- So have you.
Well, mostly luck.
You know, sheer arse, really.
But you - keep seeing you pop up everywhere?
Nate Baldwin must be quite the cash cow.
He asked me to represent him, I agreed.
Simple as that.
Yeah, hey.
Hey, not your fault that you do your job, he gets off and reoffends, needs your help again, right?
Of course, you know, that wouldn't happen if the prosecution did their job properly.
Are you including yourself in that assessment?
Well, he's certainly not including me.
Yeah, we probably shouldn't be discussing Nate.
You're absolutely right, especially when everyone else is discussing it.
Doesn't exactly make it easy, right?
- Ben!
- What?
It's just a sledge.
I'll have you know, sledging is a time-honoured tradition in Australian sport.
He can take it.
Let's get a coffee.
If we track down the arsonist, he'll probably talk, giving us one of two results -
A, he's a free agent hired by Wazim, or B, he's working for the betting syndicate.
- What would you put those odds at?
- An even 50-50.
A 50% chance of getting inside the betting network.
It's still a 50% chance it'll give us nothing.
Well, what's the current plan?
Wait for Nate Baldwin to agree to a deal based on finding a drug we don't know the whereabouts of.
Which we may or may not get in time for it to be of any use.
Sounded better when Janet said it.
That's one, two, three indeterminate variables, and the issue there's obvious.
So in terms of probability, the arsonist lead is more likely to give us a favourable outcome than the drug.
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.
It's just basic probability analysis.
You should pitch it to Janet.
We don't need to cut deals.
Hey, whatever keeps me out of jail.
Now the sponsor's dumped me in it.
You can't talk to the NCC.
- Do you want to see me go down?
- No.
Well, at the moment, the only way
I'm going to stay outside is if I get hold of that drug, right?
- Yes.
- And the only chance I've got to get that drug is if I talk to 'em, right?
Well, I don't see any other way, but I'm not totally sure they can get it either.
So where does that leave us, with Nate going to jail?
That's not happening.
What if I got it?
Shit.
Could she get it?
That's the answer, isn't it?
You see, if I get the drug, he stays out of jail, doesn't have to talk to anyone.
That's problem solved.
Are you sure you can find it?
You worry about your job, Richard, and I'll worry about mine.
OK, we need to track Maxine's phone.
Can I also remind people about the arsonist...
Later!
Just track Maxine, alright?
You think she can get it?
Hard to tell.
- Could just be Maxine shit-talk.
- That is her job.
If she knew exactly where to find it, she'd already have it.
But she knows Eddie Cooke was behind the supplement program for the Devils, like we do.
I bet that's where she's going.
She's wasting her time.
We searched every inch of Continuum and came up empty.
True, but if that drug underpinned the bet on the Devils, it has to be somewhere.
It's too valuable to completely destroy.
But would Eddie just hand over a secret drug to a sports agent?
No, he's going to want to avoid any link between him and the drug.
That'd just kill his business completely.
He's going to want a lot of assurances about anonymity, etc., before he thinks about handing it over to anyone.
But he might, eventually, to stop Nate talking.
Unless we can convince him to hand it to one of us first.
Well, not one of us, obviously.
No, somebody he thinks has absolutely nothing to do with us, like an undercover agent who goes in there as an elite athlete in need of help.
Going to need a pretty good undercover cop to pull that off.
OK, is she?
She's going to Eddie's, isn't she?
Looks like it.
OK, I think he keeps it off-site.
We need to watch these two, see where they go after this.
Eddie, please.
Now what's better for you?
Nate in jail, desperate to cut a deal, or Nate at home, free as a bird?
I don't know what Tyler took.
I do.
He did what he was told.
He followed the club rules to the letter because he needed that contract.
He wouldn't have done anything to jeopardise that.
- So whatever he took, he got here.
- I know the sports world, Eddie.
You see a lot of people, they tell me a lot of things, not least my 42 clients, but especially the five Devils.
I'm in the know, you got that?
So cut the crap and give me what you were giving them.
- There's none left.
- That's bullshit.
What, a drug that good, that gets the Devils into the semis?
As if you'd run out of that.
We'd get supplied when there was a demand, but with Tyler's death and the NCC strangling us, that demand is gone.
I don't have any left.
Well, get some more.
OK.
I will ask my supplier, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be back, Eddie.
Hello.
Where are they?
Liam's at the sausage sizzle, and Em's at the 70 metre start.
OK, great.
Have you spoken to Zoe yet?
Good luck.
Tom, take your mark back, then fast at the bar!
Hey, Zoe.
- And drive the knee up!
Hey, Janet.
- Hey, how's Emma?
Great.
Yeah, she's loving it.
Liam was too, but his ankle's still not better, so...
Don't talk to me about injuries.
Greta tore her quad last week.
No, that girl you were coaching?
Six weeks out from Worlds, ranked number two.
Last week, she's looking at a medal, now we're not even sure if she's going to make it.
That must be heartbreaking for her.
Well, yeah.
When you give up six years, stop working, count every calorie.
But I suppose in Liam's world, if he can't run at Zone, I feel sorry for him too.
Don't feel sorry for him.
He's only upset because I wouldn't give him a day off school.
Um, but, look, I was hoping to have a chat, because I'm kind of involved with sport at the moment, in a funny sort of way, and given who you are and what you do,
I was hoping to pick your brains.
Alright, we should grab a drink.
You deserve champers.
You nailed that brief.
Do you remember how much we used to struggle with summaries?
Yeah, practice makes perfect, I guess.
No, I really shouldn't.
I've got to head back and...
Come on, come on.
The bar's just around the corner, isn't it?
- Andy's got the kid, right?
- Amal, yes.
- That's a beautiful name.
- Thanks.
Hey, check this.
That's my wife, Bella.
- Yeah, we've all seen Bella.
- And that's Remy.
Gorgeous.
I just wish I got to see them more, to be honest.
But I do most of my prep at night, you know, start mapping out my opening addresses, marking up witness statements, lines of interrogation...
You've got a two-year-old and you get all that done at night?
I'm doing well if I brush my teeth.
Well, Bella hasn't gone back to work, so she does most of the hard yards with Remy, you know?
Yeah.
I'm like a "cuddle and kiss goodnight" Dad.
I so need a wife.
- No, I'd do more.
- I wasn't criticising.
No, I'm not defending, I mean it.
I...
I wish I could do more.
I thought you weren't going to lift a finger unless Nate started talking.
Well, things changed.
Other information came to light.
But I need an assurance when we find this drug, Nate will talk.
So that was just a bluff before.
You don't have it.
And if you do find material evidence in a manslaughter trial, you'll have to hand it over anyway.
Well, things do disappear from evidence rooms from time to time.
We think we can keep your client out of jail.
Your job is to buy us the time so we can wrap this up to everyone's satisfaction, without a trial actually starting.
Richard!
How are you, mate?
- Janet?
- Hello, Ben.
Wow!
What's it been, like, four or five years?
- Yeah, something like that.
- You look great.
Thank you, and I hear you're, um... married.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, got all responsible.
Settled down.
The Premier's daughter?
So, isn't it more accurate to say she settled down, you settled up?
I'm joking.
I'm sure there's a lot of love there.
Yeah.
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Ash.
That must have been terrible.
Thank you, yes.
But hey, look how far we've all come, right?
NCC Examiner, barrister, barrister...
Future Nobel Laureate.
- Currently, mother.
- Toughest job you'll ever have.
- Stay in touch?
- Yep.
- It was good to see you, Ben.
- Yeah, likewise.
See you, Janet.
Yep.
I should go too.
You've gotta be kidding me.
You're having a drink with me.
After the trial might be more appropriate, don't you think?
Let's cross swords first and then once it's all done,
- we can catch up after that.
- Cross swords?
- What sword's he got?
- What sword do you have, seriously?
I mean, I couldn't even find a tooth-pick in the facts that I read.
I'm surprised you're not pleading guilty.
One more.
Come on, my shout.
And we won't mention the case again, will we?
Never.
- So, you look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- You're not nervous?
- Shit, I'd be nervous.
I'd be sweating more than a gypsy with a mortgage, to be honest with you.
I mean, who'd wanna be you right now?
Seriously, major trial, in the public spotlight, up against this one.
With no defence.
You got enough underwear?
Pssh, right?
You're so easy to stir.
Come on, sit down.
I'll see you later.
So you know Zoe DiCosta?
I've only met her a couple of times.
Our kids go to Tiny Track together.
Wow.
Have you actually seen her gold medal race?
No, but I should look that up.
She attacked about 6K out, putting about 30 seconds between her and the peloton.
Couple of chasers went after her, but she fended them off.
She was battling a really nasty headwind for the last kay and a half too, so, yeah, it was a really, really gutsy ride.
Sounds impressive.
Yeah, it was, especially as the Spaniard who took the bronze got done for doping two years later.
Really?
Yeah, see, PEDs give you that extra 1% edge, but it doesn't mean much without putting in the 99% hard work first.
Zoe was just mentally tougher.
You've got a similar grunt.
I wasn't aware I grunted.
No, no, no, it's a good thing.
Like...
like ticker.
Or hunger.
- Pluck?
- Zoe's here.
Great.
We know the man running this sports medicine clinic has used a supplement unknown to ASADA.
The question is, what does an undercover cop have to do and say to make him believe they are genuinely from the world of elite sport and then, how to ask for some of this substance?
It's not on the banned list?
No.
What does it do?
Well, we think it speeds up recovery, aids endurance.
God, if it was legal, I'd be queuing up for it now.
Greta'd kill her grandmother to get her hands on the stuff.
- Greta?
- It's one of Zoe's cyclists.
She's a total freak of nature.
VO2 touching 70, threshold 242 and a monster TSS.
- What?
- Training Stress Score.
It's sort of a number that rates your workout.
But unfortunately, she's injured at the moment, right?
Getting over a torn quad, so her normalised power's still down about 5% to 8%, and Worlds are just around the corner.
So, it's a race against time.
Is it ever.
I think we've seen about 11 doctors, tried just about everything.
At this point, if they said, "Take arsenic,"
she probably would.
And risk death?
If it would fix her, probably worth it.
That's the way Greta's thinking.
All those sacrifices.
It's...
Well, yeah.
If I told her I could get her something not on the banned list that could get her to Worlds, she'd beg me for it.
Now, we should get all this down for the cop so that they sound like they've got the right shorthand and describe exactly what they're looking for, sound genuine.
Sure.
I mean, it would also really help if whoever we choose has a background in sport.
You know any former footballers, basketballers, someone like that on the force?
So, you've got no idea what this stuff is?
None.
Just say, for example...
just say I was asking for it,
I wouldn't be asking for a banned substance, right?
No-one's going to suggest that you...
Well, hang on a second.
Let's just think about it for a minute.
I mean, OK, let's say that you...
You never met us, but you'd heard that this guy,
Eddie Cooke, he'd been getting great results and his athletes were passing all the tests.
I'd want to know what it was and where I could get it.
OK, let's say he just gave you something in a bottle.
Even when I was racing, you're mad to take whatever anyone gives you, but you can't be on your guard the whole time.
No, so you would just take it somewhere first, to find out exactly what it was.
If I didn't know what it was, totally, yeah.
I'd have to, for my own reputation.
Right.
I'd happily do that.
I mean, I haven't asked for anything I knew is banned, and if it should be and we end up catching a drug cheat, great.
And if it turned out that it actually did help with recovery, wasn't performance enhancing...
I'd use it.
OK, so let's do it.
Hang on, Janet.
There are procedures and protocols.
We can't...
I wasn't here.
I didn't know any of this was happening.
I told you, there's none left.
Your inaction will mean that Nate Baldwin's going to talk to the Crime Commission, which can't happen, as you well know.
We both have reputations to uphold.
I got it from my supplier,
Flynn and I administered it and now it's all gone.
There's nothing I can do.
You're as useless as a shit-flavoured lollipop, Eddie.
- Recording.
- OK.
Zoe DiCosta.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Doctor Cooke.
- Eddie, please.
Welcome to Continuum.
- Bonnie.
You need to stay on Maxine.
- On it.
What brings you here?
Can I show you around?
I've heard good things, and I need help.
Wondered if you might be able to.
I hope so.
So, what's the problem?
Not sure if you know, but I'm coaching Greta Beckett.
Yeah, yeah.
Time triallist.
Individual pursuit.
I know.
She tore her quad last week.
- Medialis?
- Femoris.
Grade two.
And when are the Worlds?
Six weeks, but if she takes three or four weeks off to recover, her power will drop, and even down 4 or 5 watts, that's...
- First to third.
- Or fourth or even fifth.
We really need a fast recovery.
She's been good with icing?
Compression?
- Yeah.
On top of that.
- Janet?
We managed it well in the beginning, it's just now.
She's got to give herself time to get her threshold back up over 240.
But all the physios are saying another fortnight before she can pedal, and Greta's like,
"Get me back on the bike now."
Then we heard about you, the miracle man.
Have you tried PRPs?
The plasma injections?
Are they really that good?
- They certainly help.
- Full recovery?
She'll take anything, Eddie.
Well, obviously nothing on the banned list.
She still gets out-of-competition tested, but if there's anything else.
Please.
She's given up her life for this.
You know what athletes are like.
I'm sorry, but there's not much else I can offer.
Come on, Zoe.
Come on.
Think of something.
Eddie, if you help Greta win, it'll be your victory too.
And in front of the whole media, I promise, you will get the credit you deserve.
You will be the man who got her back to the starting line, and everyone in the world will know it.
OK.
If I can help, I'll give you a call tomorrow.
She's good.
They always said she was tough to race.
No, it's all gone.
Once Tyler died and we found there was something weird about his blood, we binned it all.
I know how you hang out with the stars, their girlfriends, whoever.
And they let you.
Not because you're the fun guy, but because you sell them fun.
Whatever they want, you've got.
Now a drug that gets the Devils from last to fourth, there's got to be other buyers for that, right?
- What's your offer?
- So, you mean you do have it?
One bottle, 20 grand.
Cash.
You've got to be kidding me.
But it's incredible stuff.
That's the price.
Take it or leave it.
Alright, I'll take it.
You're a fuckin' little shit.
You're gonna regret this.
You gettin' 20,000 off her?
- Can you loan me a grand?
- Yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
It's to bail my friend Cindi out.
She really needs it.
You staying at home tonight?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Mr Stirling, what is your argument for having this trial not proceed?
Your Honour, the negative publicity surrounding my client's case and his reputation is enormous.
It is inconceivable he can receive a fair trial in the current environment.
And in support of this submission?
Well, yes, Your Honour.
There is considerable evidence from many internet sites that I wish to present to the court.
Your Honour, do we really need to hear all of it?
Social media is not new, Mr Stirling, and the legal system has managed to operate successfully since its inception.
I appreciate that, Your Honour, but the wealth of supporting material forms a compelling basis for my submission.
Your Honour, Nate Baldwin is a very public sports figure.
It would be almost impossible to find a juror in the entire state who had never heard of him.
Indeed, yes.
Even I have heard of him.
Meaning recent coverage is unlikely to have altered anyone's opinion of him.
If cases are to be thrown out on the basis that social media creates unfair trials, well, then nothing would ever be tried in court again.
My instructions to the jury will be to take into account only evidence presented in court, not hearsay outside of it.
Therefore, press coverage cannot unduly influence them.
It is impossible for anyone to forget hearsay.
Are you suggesting I am a biased judge, Mr Stirling?
Of course not, Your Honour.
The request to have the trial not proceed is denied.
Trial will commence tomorrow at 9am.
Your Honour, I would like to make a last-minute request for a judge-only trial.
Your Honour, my learned colleague cannot keep delaying this trial.
Exactly what I was thinking.
It is in the public interest for this trial to be completely above any suspicion of bias, Your Honour.
And given the adverse publicity surrounding the trial...
Objection, Your Honour - it's the same argument.
I am not questioning the clarity or authority of your instructions to the jury, Your Honour, but their ability to adhere to them.
Very well.
Submissions to me by 9am tomorrow.
Well played, mate.
See you tomorrow.
Can't wait.
Bring it on.
Can't wait for the all-nighter on a judge-only submission.
Well, he shouldn't have demolished the not-proceed option so well.
He's not really enjoying this as much as he looks.
Yes, he is.
You're enjoying it too, right?
I'm warming to it.
Maxine.
Yes, this is...
- 20,000?
- Cash.
- Did you see it at Flynn's?
- No, but I'm sure he's got some.
Or he might just want to pocket 20 grand.
We won't know for sure until we turn up with the money.
Have you got that much?
Me?
20,000 in cash?
What do I look like, an ATM machine?
What about you?
No!
Well, Nate, we could get that somehow, couldn't we?
It's just... it takes a few days to organise that much.
Right, if we're moving that amount of cash, we've got to make sure the tax office isn't looking at us.
We'll take it out in bits.
OK, just...
look, leave it with me.
I'll sell a few things.
I'll get it together somehow.
Save all our arses, as per.
I thought we were tracking Maxine's phone.
- We are.
- I am.
So you knew she was seeing Flynn Pearce?
You didn't tell us?
How long until we can get a listening device into Flynn's?
Could take us a day to get the warrant.
OK, forget the warrant.
That'll happen when it happens.
An hour.
OK, do it.
Make sure it's there before she goes back.
But without a warrant, anything we record is...
OK, you just need to shut up, alright?
The one time you should have opened your mouth is the only time in the last six weeks you've kept it closed.
In case it escaped your attention, which for an analyst there is absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here.
Against time, a manslaughter trial and Maxine Reynolds.
She buys that drug, presents it to the court, gets Nate off, we're back to square one.
That's what's at stake here and you've just put all of that in jeopardy!
I'm sorry.
I was...
OK, what were you doing?
No, no, let me guess.
You were still trying to figure out the identity of the arsonist because you decided that was the priority, not locating the drug.
You are not running your own reference here.
You are part of a team and I am the one who dictates the direction of it, not you.
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're the smartest person in the room.
You're not.
Out.
Richard.
Can you just... just tell me, and be honest - what are his chances?
Maxine finding that drug could make all the difference, providing Flynn isn't ripping her off.
Right.
If he gets locked up, I have no money.
I have nothing.
Well, this isn't a crime that they seize assets for.
You'd still have your bank accounts, your credit cards...
I don't have any.
I don't even have this betting account that's supposedly mine.
I wish.
I mean I get my bags, make-up, shoes, all from my sponsors, who are all dumping me quick smart.
You've never had your own money?
Because I'm a typical WAG who sponges off her husband and goes to the opening of an envelope?
No, no, no.
Of course not.
Do you know how we met?
In a taxi rank.
Nate had been to some do and I'd had a Mozart recital.
You like classical music?
I play it.
I went to the Conservatorium of Music.
Look...
Nate takes care of everything for me.
He looks after me.
You might want to make alternative arrangements, just in case.
He won't do that.
I'll see if I can talk some sense into him.
Thank you.
We should be online in Flynn's place now.
Want me to check?
Yes, thank you.
- Cindi needs me.
- Yeah, well, I need you.
No, you don't know what she's going through.
It's really messed up.
Welfare overpaid her and she owes 'em a grand she doesn't have and she can't get her benefits until she's paid it back.
You sure you can't help?
I'm not a charity, Pearl.
Come on, why don't...
why don't you just chill out?
We can relax.
The guy that killed my brother goes on trial tomorrow.
I want to have a drink with my friend.
Sure.
You want to see Cindi, go see Cindi.
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
I just thought you needed a place to stay, that's all.
I mean, if you don't, fine, go.
I'm not keeping you locked up.
But if you go now don't come back here.
OK.
What do you want to do?
I want you to take your clothes off.
We can have some fun, yeah?
We don't have the warrant in place, do we?
No.
Good girl.
Good girl.
OK.
I've heard enough.
Don't forget to argue the strengths of the Westminster system.
Andy, what about your mum?
Can she pick Amal up?
Richard's just dropped an application for judge-only on us.
You know how it's underpinned by a belief juries take their responsibilities very seriously.
No, my brother can't.
His car's getting repaired.
Study after study shows this to be the case.
Yeah, well, I'll call you back in five.
Just thought I'd check in and see how you're both doing.
All good.
Yeah, we're on top of it.
You go.
We were just finishing up.
I don't want to lose another case with a high-profile sportsman.
We won't, but we could find a few more arguments.
No, we've got it with what you've given me.
You go see your daughter, right?
Give her a cuddle from me.
Crossed wires with Andy about childcare.
First time for everything, right?
Right.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Mummy.
Yeah.
Did you give her something for the pain?
Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to work.
Bub - those horrible toothy-pegs still hurting?
Come here.
- Hey, you've got court tomorrow.
- Go to bed.
Yeah, it is tomorrow.
I just want to make sure I've got all the points in my head.
Well, it's no good if your head's asleep on the bench.
Well, I don't want Ben or Owen to think I'm not across it.
As if they would.
I've had to leave early a couple of times.
I...
I'd change my shifts but I've got three men on stress leave.
It's fine.
I can manage, Andy.
Hey you don't have to prove anything to anyone, OK?
You're doing a brilliant job.
Owen says so, Ben says so, I think so.
You stop doubting yourself.
Got a visual on Cooke again.
And someone's not too happy with him.
Mitchell Douglas, the coach of the Devils.
Now he's getting into his car.
Alone.
Didn't appear to be carrying anything.
He's heading south.
Bay Road.
- Stay on him.
- Rightio.
He's going to Flynn's.
He's going to get the drug.
- Confident.
- Where's Maxine?
Heading to the bank again.
She got 9 grand out yesterday.
And Flynn?
Still snoring.
Pearl's left for court.
The warrant's in place, so whatever we hear now is admissible, but we still need...
That statement from Pearl.
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thanks.
How do you think you'll go today?
Will the Devils release you from your contract?
No comment.
Please, can you give us some space?
Should be here by this afternoon.
- Tomorrow at the latest.
- Viki!
Ms Perati, do you have any comment?
My son was taken from me by that monster who pretended to be his friend.
You're sure you don't need me in there?
Yeah.
Look, Nate's got a temper, but he's not the monster they're making him out to be.
- OK?
He looked out for Ty.
- This isn't fair.
You weren't a witness.
I've got to do something to help make it right, OK?
One of our boys has died.
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry, Mitchell.
- Any news?
- Close.
I believe we're very close.
Hi, Pearl.
Um, bit crazy, isn't it?
You want to get away from here?
- We'll have a chat?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Your Honour, the Westminster system is underpinned by the fact that juries take their responsibilities extremely seriously.
I mean, the average citizen is perfectly capable of putting hearsay and personal bias aside and paying serious attention to the facts presented.
Your belief in the process is commendable.
Your Honour, news feeds and social media are awash with damning indictments of the accused.
Now, this is far from normal hearsay and only a trained legal mind, such as Your Honour's, can truly ignore this bias and consider the facts, as you said yesterday.
Therefore, by your own argument, you are the only person entitled to hear this trial.
Well argued, Mr Stirling.
But don't ever try it again.
Yes, Your Honour.
I agree to the request made by Mr Stirling for a judge-only trial.
Now, gentlemen, can we declare a ceasefire and get on with this?
This must be a difficult day for you.
I can understand why you don't want to be in there, hear everything that happened.
I don't need to.
He's guilty.
He hit Ty.
They'll lock him up and then...
And then?
There'll be justice.
For Ty.
And what about you?
Don't you deserve justice?
I'm alright.
It's pretty clear what the arrangement is with Flynn.
He's 28 years old.
You're underage.
You can't legally give consent to have...
Piss off!
I can give consent whenever I want.
Don't act like this isn't my choice.
- It's... it's my life.
- It's a crime, Pearl.
In six months, it won't be.
I can get public housing on my own.
What, so sexual abuse is the price you're willing to pay for a roof over your head?
There are better options.
Yeah?
Like share houses?
You ever been in one?
Full of junkies who just take all your shit?
Or I could go back home, to Mum getting shitfaced and laying into me.
And Kevin.
Or I could, sleep in a gutter or a shop door.
You think that'd be better?
Of course not, but there has to be something else, yeah?
Something better than Flynn.
There's not, but.
That's it, you see?
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.
He can help out my friend Cindi.
She's worse off than me.
I figured out a way.
I'm making it work.
It's my choice, not yours.
Pearl...
Hard copies of all the surveillance on Maxine and Eddie.
Thanks, but Wayne's on Eddie.
Of course, but just in case you need to cross-reference their movements.
OK.
Yeah, sure.
It's what I do.
I'm thorough, meticulous, on-task, 24/7, analysing data, which, to be effective, requires a broad scope.
So while my focus may appear to shift at times, it's only because every piece of information needs to be studied exhaustively.
I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't.
You should probably be explaining this to Janet.
I think it helps if the chief investigator also appreciates the particular demands of an analyst.
So I can put in a good word for you, you mean?
No.
It's just...
I get data, look for patterns.
It's puzzle solving with a real-world impact and I think it's a buzz and...
Yeah.
Bonnie, I'm kind of busy right...
Am I getting fired?
What?
Bonnie, you stuffed up.
We all do.
Just get over it and move on.
Put Wayne on.
He's gone into a chemist.
Cartwrights, Lavender Street, Granville.
Why go halfway across town to a chemist?
They're old friends and he gets a discount?
Or maybe Eddie's supplying him with peds.
Unlikely.
He's a cleanskin, according to this.
Owned by Lionel Cartwright.
Pharmacy degree, compounding chemist of 25 years.
No priors, nothing.
Eddie's on the move.
Could be in for more action now.
He's just arrived at Flynn's.
So, what did the chemist have to do with this?
We can pick up Eddie inside.
Keep a visual on him if you can, Wayne.
I told you to get rid of it.
You know what I can get for it.
I've got a better offer.
Technically you stole it from me.
OK, I'll give you a cut.
I need it now.
How much have you got?
50ml.
I kept one bottle, that's all.
As soon as he's outside, Wayne can grab Eddie...
And risk Eddie smashing it on the road?
Losing everything?
No, let it run all the way to Zoe's.
Then we can look after it properly.
Great.
Much safer strategy.
That wasn't meant to sound patronising, honestly.
Just... genuine.
No offence.
Could you show the court what you saw when the accused hit the victim?
It was like this, to the side of Ty's face.
He stumbled, fell backwards.
Try to say something, mate.
Come on!
Come on, mate.
Ty?
So he was hit hard enough to be knocked over?
Well, yeah.
I guess so.
No further questions, Your Honour.
When the victim fell, did you hear the accused say anything?
Yeah, he said, "Sorry, mate,"
and when Ty didn't get back up, he said, "I didn't hit him that hard".
He kept saying it.
- Did you believe him?
- Yeah.
So, it's possible the blow wasn't hard enough to make the victim fall?
Yeah, maybe.
Only a...
Only what, Mr Metcalf?
Only I just remembered Tyler didn't trip.
He was lunging forward at the time, trying to grab the phone with the pictures.
One of them got that drug yet?
Maxine?
What's-her-face?
Anyone?
Look, what if I talk to 'em?
The NCC?
I don't think it'd make a difference now.
So, what's the plan from here?
I think Richard's going to call Nate as a witness.
What?
It's a chance for the judge to hear firsthand your relationship with the victim.
And risk us trapping him into saying something he shouldn't?
Why you'd never have laid into him with full force.
I thought you said you don't normally do that?
Well, he's got nothing else.
We've got no choice.
And I think you could really help yourself.
And you know Richard.
Never say die.
He'll find some angle.
He'll try and counter Nate's public image.
It'll all be about tearing down the aggro and the thuggery and showing his warm, caring side.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Well, this is Richard.
Whatever he's got will be carefully thought-out.
You think he's still got a chance?
It's still Nate Baldwin.
If we get him angry, he'll undo everything.
What the fuck do you mean you don't have it?
I mean it was for sale, and now it's been sold.
Who to?
Was it Eddie?
Fuckin' lying sack of shit.
It was a private sale.
Do you know you have had me running all around town.
I have grabbed cash every way I know how because we had a deal.
Now tell me who the hell has the drug now!
No.
You're fuckin' dead, Mr Pearce.
You're dead.
So, according to your expert analysis of the deceased's autopsy and toxicology report, could you explain for the court what the cause of death was?
A subdural haematoma.
That is, bleeding which fills the brain area rapidly, compressing brain tissue.
And what caused that haematoma?
A serious blow to the head.
A large contusion on the side of the face corresponded to where the deceased was struck.
And that was the only cause of the bleeding?
There were some anomalies in the reports regarding the failure of the deceased's blood to coagulate properly.
The cause of that was not possible to determine.
Was it a contributing factor to the death of Mr Perati?
I couldn't categorically state that, no.
Nothing further.
I think this might be able to help you.
Thanks.
2ml daily, top thigh.
Four or five days should do the trick.
And there's no chance of it testing positive?
Lots of guys were on it last year.
Passed everything.
Well, in that case, when Greta wins a medal, we'll know who to thank.
Tell the lab to be on stand-by.
We need this tested as soon as possible.
We have to be sure it's the substance that killed Tyler.
Your witness, Mr Stirling.
That's not a phone, is it, Mr Stirling?
Mr Stirling!
Your Honour, I wish to apply for an adjournment, because my instructions have been compromised.
Compromised in what way, Mr Stirling?
My client has said something that is difficult to interpret.
You mean, he wishes to change his plea?
Your Honour, I've received mixed messages and need a private audience with my client to confirm his instructions.
If we could adjourn for the rest of the day...
Your Honour, my learned colleague only needs a minute to ask his client what he meant.
A couple of hours to advise my client calmly, ensure he understands the entirely of the situation is not unreasonable.
There are a lot of grey areas in this case.
Including the hairs you're putting on my head, Mr Stirling.
You have an hour.
So I get the cash together,
I go there and then he says he doesn't have it anymore.
I just don't know what to do.
So how's it looking your end, Richard?
Sorry, gotta go.
Shit.
- Have you got it?
- Still waiting for the lab results.
If it's not here in 20 minutes, I've got to put Nate on the stand.
Well, you can stretch that out.
Go back to his childhood, his love for the game.
You used to hate it when the defence resorted to sob stories for a win.
Well, there's an exception for everything.
Good luck.
I met Tyler a couple of years ago.
He'd just been spotted in a schoolboys' team and he got into a clinic the Devils run for up-and-coming players.
I gave him some tips.
I could tell how keen he was, you know - that hunger to make it.
Anyway, he got signed on and, yeah, we hung out a bit.
You mentor a lot of younger players.
What made Tyler special?
He told me he didn't have a dad, so I, um... you know, I just...
I looked out for him, gave him advice.
He never really talked about it, but I could tell the pressure that he was under to make first grade 'cause of what that meant for his family.
The money.
I knew they were doing it tough and, you know, they counted on him to take care of them.
You're successful, wealthy.
How could you really know what that was like?
Well, I know that pressure.
An injury or something can end your career in a flash and suddenly...
suddenly you've got nothin'.
So, you've gotta work your guts out to stay at the top of your form.
I know how much training and sacrifice that takes.
I've lived it.
I saw Ty live it.
I knew exactly what he wanted, 'cause it's what I've always wanted and I would never, ever have done anything to take that away from him.
So you had a real connection with him?
What?
Well, you and Tyler.
You obviously had a common bond.
We were good mates, yeah.
I mean, it sounded a lot more than that to me.
I'd imagine you get to know your fellow teammates pretty well in that locker room...
Objection, Your Honour.
Relevance.
Your Honour, I'm merely wanting to establish the intimate bonds of male teammates, which some may describe as homoerotic.
Homo what?
And the bond between Nate Baldwin and Tyler Perati, which was clearly on and off the field...
Hey, fuck off!
It wasn't like that!
I'm not gay.
You can't...
you can't say that shit to me!
Objection.
This is assuming a fact not in evidence, Your Honour.
No, look, I'm just saying you've got no right to imply something like that.
Sustained.
Thank you, Mr Crown.
Withdrawn, Your Honour.
I did nothin'...wrong.
I didn't even hit him that hard.
I know I didn't.
Hey.
News?
The lab's just emailed the results.
What?
What's happening?
H2O.
- It was water.
- What?
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.
But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?
Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?
What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?
- He won't.
- Whoever he sells it to will.
Serves 'em both right.
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?
Mate, Flynn was askin' 20.
What is it?
Who cares?
I found someone to buy it, that's all that matters.
When's he comin'?
Soon.
And if he doesn't turn up, there's plenty of other contacts in Flynn's phone.
And we can pay off your debt and you'll be sweet.
We could, like, get our own place and stuff, just you and me.
Fuck, it'd be so cool.
Hey, what are you doing?
It's a 20,000 trip.
You know, as if I'm not gonna try that.
- Don't be stupid.
- It'd be stupid not to!
- Cindi, for fuck's sake!
- No, I need that money.
Stop!
Look, he won't even notice.
Mr Baldwin.
The emotional impact of your evidence was considerable.
The bond you shared with the victim was obviously deeply felt and genuine.
Your role as a mentor and father-figure in his life is without question.
However, the strength of your relationship cannot alter the facts presented by the autopsy and toxicology reports.
The large bruise on the deceased's body directly corresponds with the blow with which you struck him, and the size of the bruise indicates the force behind it.
I find no other contributing factors to his death, other than the punch, and so on one count of manslaughter,
I find you guilty.
Sentencing to take place at a date to be determined.
Please remove the prisoner.
OK, although I usually don't comment on verdicts,
I am aware of recent public concern about decisions made by the DPP.
I have no doubt today's outcome will restore public confidence in the DPP and I would especially like to acknowledge the team responsible for preparing such a strong case to present to court, led by Ben McMahon.
Maybe it was Flynn.
Maybe he swapped the real drug for water.
But he's been pissed off all day, because he thinks he's lost 20 grand.
Did Eddie give Zoe the wrong bottle?
Like, an accident.
It was unlabelled.
After he went to so much trouble to get it for her?
It's unlikely.
Was Eddie onto us?
Is that possible?
Then, why go through the whole charade of giving her anything?
Why not just say no the first time she asked for it?
He's an arrogant bastard?
Was Eddie Cooke playing us?
And if he was, how involved is he in the whole thing?
Does all this link back to Eddie?
Help, somebody!
Please help!
You're alright.
Come on.
Help, somebody!
Help!
Somebody, come on, help us!
That bottle is a critical piece of evidence in a national investigation.
Now, if you want to get arrested, fine, run off.
If not, just give it to me!
I could be in here for 12 years!
I can't do it.
I've gotta spill my guts to the NCC.
That'll knock some time off.
No, not happening.
You tell them nothing.
Could Maxine be the head of the whole syndicate?
Well, that would mean she's let her own client go to jail over a drug that propped up her betting plunges.
Interesting business model.
We're too late.
I know you're looking into Tyler's death and whether there were drugs involved.
The club said you are.
I can't discuss this reference with you, Richard.
It could break causation for Nate, so if you know anything, I need to hear it.
I find there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and commit Nathaniel Baldwin to trial for manslaughter.
You are supposed to be keeping him out of jail, Richard.
I'm not getting locked up!
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.
Cindi.
Pearl.
Where's Tyler's jersey?
The Devils' jersey, it's gone.
- Yeah...
- That was my brother's!
You psycho bitch!
I'm not going back to that shithole.
No way.
Well, where else is there.
Home?
As if.
I'll figure something else out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Flynn, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She's 15.
- I know, he's a creep.
- You all good?
Yeah?
- Yeah.
This is right before the time of the fire, from a petrol station two minutes away.
That's who set fire to Wazim's house?
Has to be.
Who are you?
You mean to say you deliberately arranged extra payments outside the salary cap?
That's all.
No bets, no fixes.
We just wanted Nate.
I had to tell them about Nate, just the salary cap.
Shit.
Janet King 3x04 June 1, 2017
I've been informed that the APL has a report alleging that the Northern Devils Football Club was involved in breaching their salary cap to induce Nate Baldwin to re-sign.
I merely wish to confirm there is no direct evidence linking Pax Car Rentals to this allegation, and I'm confident that any investigation...
Great fucking timing!
Fuck this.
As sponsors, we are not privy to any of the financial arrangements the club may enter into with any of its players.
How can he get away with that?
Uh, well, he's choosing his words very carefully.
I mean, the deal was verbal.
Pax itself was never mentioned and he's fighting to keep that company afloat.
But he made a statement.
Well, it depends how much of that statement we did or didn't pass on to the APL.
And, as I'm sure you can imagine, most of Mr King's evidence had to remain confidential in order for us to conduct our investigation.
So those transcripts...
Were considerably redacted for security...
- security...
- purposes.
I don't want us giving him any favours.
"Ah, thank you, Tony." "Don't mention it, Janet."
Well, why are you helping him?
He's not your father.
No, but he's still yours.
You going to call Richard Stirling about a deal with Nate?
What?
No.
No?
He'd do anything to stop his client facing a jury right now, wouldn't he?
Thug and salary cheat, all over every news feed, and we need Nate talking.
- Thank you.
- We heard the man who forced
Clay Nelson to kill himself inside his house.
Which is why my position will be stronger when Richard calls me.
- What if he doesn't?
- Well, we'll see, right?
Anything else?
Yeah, I went to a Gender Equality in the Public Service breakfast this morning.
Owen Mitchell was telling us how he'd single-handedly raised the ratio of women at the DPP.
I thought that'd get your attention.
Anyway, we got talking and he said there was a change in prosecutors for the Baldwin trial.
And who is it now?
I thought you had a good relationship with the press?
Darling, if this was just dirt on the floor
I could sweep it under the rug.
But unfortunately, the whole bloody house is on fire.
Well, it does make an acquittal even more difficult.
- You do realise that?
- Of course I do!
God, how did this become so hard?
- What?
- Getting Nate into retirement.
- His last year at the club.
- Well, ask Graham King.
I mean, why invest all that money and then hang the club and its star player out to dry?
Okay, right now we just need to focus on getting Nate cleared.
That's the main game right now.
What are you doing?
Focusing.
Janet.
Hi.
Please, it's a simple question.
Have you identified the drug Tyler was taking before he was killed?
Is your client willing to tell us the name of the man who gave him an envelope of cash the other day, and everything he knows about match-fixing and gambling?
He might, if he was sure it meant he'd avoid jail.
It's the only chance he has.
No trial is a foregone conclusion, Janet, you know that.
And without the drug, you have little defence.
We both know that too.
So, time's ticking.
Why don't you go and advise your client how to stay out of jail, all right?
When he talks, we'll act.
Oh, and I take it you've heard about the new Crown you'll be opposing?
You've done an excellent job on the brief.
It's so strong, a three-legged dog could win it.
Woof.
Lina, if it was at all possible for you to run it, you would be.
And I'll definitely make sure you get all due credit when the time comes.
Owen!
Hi.
Sorry, Lina.
I heard there's been...
there's been a change?
Yes.
- Who?
- Guess.
What?
Richard!
How good's this, eh?
Mate against mate.
Ben McMahon.
Yep!
Former colleagues going toe to toe.
Should be fun, right?
Play nice, kids.
- So, you've had quite the rise.
- So have you.
Ah, well, mostly luck.
You know, sheer arse, really.
But you, keep seeing you pop up everywhere, hmm?
Nate Baldwin must be quite the cash cow.
He asked me to represent him, I agreed.
Simple as that.
Yeah, hey.
Hey, not your fault that you do your job, he gets off and reoffends, needs your help again, right?
Of course, you know, that wouldn't happen if the prosecution did their job properly.
Are you including yourself in that assessment?
Well, he's certainly not including me.
Yeah, we probably shouldn't be discussing Nate.
You're absolutely right, especially when everyone else is discussing it.
Doesn't exactly make it easy, right?
- Ben!
- What?
It's just a sledge.
I'll have you know, sledging is a time-honoured tradition in Australian sport.
He can take it.
Let's get a coffee.
If we track down the arsonist, he'll probably talk, giving us one of two results...
A, he's a free agent hired by Wazim, or B, he's working for the betting syndicate.
- What would you put those odds at?
- An even 50-50.
A 50% chance of getting inside the betting network.
It's still a 50% chance it'll give us nothing.
Well, what's the current plan?
Wait for Nate Baldwin to agree to a deal based on finding a drug we don't know the whereabouts of.
Which we may or may not get in time for it to be of any use.
Sounded better when Janet said it.
That's one, two, three indeterminate variables, and the issue there's obvious.
So in terms of probability, the arsonist lead is more likely to give us a favourable outcome than the drug.
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.
It's just basic probability analysis.
You should pitch it to Janet.
We don't need to cut deals.
Hey, whatever keeps me out of jail.
Now the sponsor's dumped me in it.
You can't talk to the NCC.
- Do you want to see me go down?
- No.
Well, at the moment, the only way
I'm going to stay outside is if I get hold of that drug, right?
- Yes.
- And the only chance I've got to get that drug is if I talk to 'em, right?
Well, I don't see any other way, but I'm not totally sure they can get it either.
So where does that leave us, with Nate going to jail?
That's not happening.
What if I got it?
Shit.
Could she get it?
That's the answer, isn't it?
You see, if I get the drug, he stays out of jail, doesn't have to talk to anyone.
That's problem solved.
Are you sure you can find it?
You worry about your job, Richard, and I'll worry about mine.
Okay, we need to track Maxine's phone.
Can I also remind people about the arsonist...
Later!
Just track Maxine, all right?
You think she can get it?
Hard to tell.
- Could just be Maxine shit-talk.
- That is her job.
If she knew exactly where to find it, she'd already have it.
But she knows Eddie Cooke was behind the supplement program for the Devils, like we do.
I bet that's where she's going.
She's wasting her time.
We searched every inch of Continuum and came up empty.
True, but if that drug underpinned the bet on the Devils, it has to be somewhere.
It's too valuable to completely destroy.
But would Eddie just hand over a secret drug to a sports agent?
No, he's going to want to avoid any link between him and the drug.
That'd just kill his business completely.
He's going to want a lot of assurances about anonymity, etc., before he thinks about handing it over to anyone.
But he might, eventually, to stop Nate talking.
Unless we can convince him to hand it to one of us first.
Well, not one of us, obviously.
No, somebody he thinks has absolutely nothing to do with us, like an undercover agent who goes in there as an elite athlete in need of help.
Going to need a pretty good undercover cop to pull that off.
Okay, is she?
She's going to Eddie's, isn't she?
Looks like it.
Okay, I think he keeps it off-site.
We need to watch these two, see where they go after this.
Eddie, please.
Now what's better for you?
Nate in jail, desperate to cut a deal, or Nate at home, free as a bird?
I don't know what Tyler took.
I do.
He did what he was told.
He followed the club rules to the letter because he needed that contract.
He wouldn't have done anything to jeopardise that.
So whatever he took, he got here.
I know the sports world, Eddie.
You see a lot of people, they tell me a lot of things, not least my 42 clients, but especially the five Devils.
I'm in the know, you got that?
So cut the crap and give me what you were giving them.
- There's none left.
- That's bullshit.
What, a drug that good, that gets the Devils into the semis?
As if you'd run out of that.
We'd get supplied when there was a demand, but with Tyler's death and the NCC strangling us, that demand is gone.
I don't have any left.
Well, get some more.
Okay.
I will ask my supplier, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be back, Eddie.
Hello.
Where are they?
Liam's at the sausage sizzle, and Em's at the 70 metre start.
Okay, great.
Have you spoken to Zoe yet?
Good luck.
Tom, take your mark back, then fast at the bar!
Hey, Zoe.
And drive the knee up!
Hey, Janet.
Hey, how's Emma?
Great.
Yeah, she's loving it.
Liam was too, but his ankle's still not better, so...
Don't talk to me about injuries.
Greta tore her quad last week.
Oh, no, that girl you were coaching?
Six weeks out from Worlds, ranked number two.
Last week, she's looking at a medal, now we're not even sure if she's going to make it.
That must be heartbreaking for her.
Well, yeah.
When you give up six years, stop working, count every calorie.
But I suppose in Liam's world, if he can't run at Zone, I feel sorry for him too.
Oh, don't feel sorry for him.
He's only upset because I wouldn't give him a day off school.
Um, but, look, I was hoping to have a chat, because I'm kind of involved with sport at the moment, in a funny sort of way, and given who you are and what you do,
I was hoping to pick your brains.
All right, we should grab a drink.
You deserve champers.
You nailed that brief.
Do you remember how much we used to struggle with summaries?
Oh, yeah, practice makes perfect, I guess.
No, I really shouldn't.
I've got to head back and...
Oh, come on, come on.
The bar's just around the corner, isn't it?
- Andy's got the kid, right?
- Amal, yes.
- That's a beautiful name.
- Oh, thanks.
Hey, check this.
- Oh!
- That's my wife, Bella.
- Oh, yeah, we've all seen Bella.
- And that's Remy.
Gorgeous.
I just wish I got to see them more, to be honest.
But I do most of my prep at night, you know, start mapping out my opening addresses, marking up witness statements, lines of interrogation...
You've got a two-year-old and you get all that done at night?
I'm doing well if I brush my teeth.
Well, Bella hasn't gone back to work, so she does most of the hard yards with Remy, you know?
Yeah.
I'm like a "cuddle and kiss goodnight" Dad.
I so need a wife.
- No, I'd do more.
- I wasn't criticising.
No, I'm not defending, I mean it.
I...
I wish I could do more.
I thought you weren't going to lift a finger unless Nate started talking.
Well, things changed.
Other information came to light.
But I need an assurance when we find this drug, Nate will talk.
So that was just a bluff before.
You don't have it.
And if you do find material evidence in a manslaughter trial, you'll have to hand it over anyway.
Well, things do disappear from evidence rooms from time to time.
We think we can keep your client out of jail.
Your job is to buy us the time so we can wrap this up to everyone's satisfaction, without a trial actually starting.
Richard!
How are you, mate?
- Janet?
- Hello, Ben.
Wow!
What's it been, like, four or five years?
- Yeah, something like that.
- You look great.
Thank you, and I hear you're, um... married.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, got all responsible.
Settled down.
The Premier's daughter?
So, isn't it more accurate to say she settled down, you settled up?
I'm joking.
I'm sure there's a lot of love there.
Yeah.
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Ash.
That must have been terrible.
Thank you, yes.
But hey, look how far we've all come, right?
NCC Examiner, barrister, barrister...
Future Nobel Laureate.
- Currently, mother.
- Toughest job you'll ever have.
- Stay in touch, huh?
- Yep.
- It was good to see you, Ben.
- Yeah, likewise.
See you, Janet.
Yep.
- I should go too.
- Oh!
You've gotta be kidding me, right?
You're having a drink with me.
After the trial might be more appropriate, don't you think?
Let's cross swords first and then once it's all done,
- we can catch up after that.
- Cross swords?
What sword's he got?
What sword do you have, seriously?
I mean, I couldn't even find a tooth-pick in the facts that I read.
I'm surprised you're not pleading guilty.
One more.
Come on, my shout.
And we won't mention the case again, will we?
Oh, never.
- So, you look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
You're not nervous?
Shit, I'd be nervous.
I'd be sweating more than a gypsy with a mortgage, to be honest with you.
I mean, who'd wanna be you right now?
Seriously, major trial, in the public spotlight, up against this one.
With no defence.
You got enough underwear?
Pssh, right?
You're so easy to stir.
Come on, sit down.
I'll see you later.
So you know Zoe DiCosta?
Oh, I've only met her a couple of times.
Our kids go to Tiny Track together.
Oh, wow.
Have you actually seen her gold medal race?
No, but I should look that up.
She attacked about 6K out, putting about 30 seconds between her and the peloton.
Couple of chasers went after her, but she fended them off.
She was battling a really nasty headwind for the last K and a half too, so, yeah, it was a really, really gutsy ride.
Sounds impressive.
Yeah, it was, especially as the Spaniard who took the bronze got done for doping two years later.
Really?
Yeah, see, PEDs give you that extra 1% edge, but it doesn't mean much without putting in the 99% hard work first.
Zoe was just mentally tougher.
You've got a similar grunt.
Oh, I wasn't aware I grunted.
Oh, no, no, no, it-it-it's a good thing.
Like...
like ticker.
Or hunger.
- Pluck?
- Zoe's here.
Great.
We know the man running this sports medicine clinic has used a supplement unknown to ASADA.
The question is, what does an undercover cop have to do and say to make him believe they are genuinely from the world of elite sport and then, how to ask for some of this substance?
It's not on the banned list?
No.
What does it do?
Well, we think it speeds up recovery, aids endurance.
God, if it was legal, I'd be queuing up for it now.
Greta'd kill her grandmother to get her hands on the stuff.
- Greta?
- It's one of Zoe's cyclists.
She's a total freak of nature.
VO2 touching 70, threshold 242 and a monster TSS.
- W-what?
- Training Stress Score.
It's sort of a number that rates your workout.
But unfortunately, she's injured at the moment, right?
Getting over a torn quad, so her normalised power's still down about 5% to 8%, and Worlds are just around the corner.
So, it's a race against time.
Is it ever.
I think we've seen about 11 doctors, tried just about everything.
At this point, if they said, "Take arsenic,"
she probably would.
And risk death?
If it would fix her, probably worth it.
That's the way Greta's thinking.
All those sacrifices.
It's...
Well, yeah.
If I told her I could get her something not on the banned list that could get her to Worlds, she'd beg me for it.
Now, we should get all this down for the cop so that they sound like they've got the right shorthand and describe exactly what they're looking for, sound genuine.
Sure.
I mean, it would also really help if whoever we choose has a background in sport.
You know any former footballers, basketballers, someone like that on the force?
So, you've got no idea what this stuff is?
None.
Just say, for example... just say I was asking for it,
I wouldn't be asking for a banned substance, right?
No one's going to suggest that you...
Well, hang on a second.
Let's just think about it for a minute.
I mean, okay, let's say that you...
You never met us, but you'd heard that this guy,
Eddie Cooke, he'd been getting great results and his athletes were passing all the tests.
I'd want to know what it was and where I could get it.
Okay, let's say he just gave you something in a bottle.
Even when I was racing, you're mad to take whatever anyone gives you, but you can't be on your guard the whole time.
No, so you would just take it somewhere first, to find out exactly what it was.
If I didn't know what it was, totally, yeah.
I'd have to, for my own reputation.
- Right.
- I'd happily do that.
I mean, I haven't asked for anything I knew is banned, and if it should be and we end up catching a drug cheat, great.
And if it turned out that it actually did help with recovery, wasn't performance enhancing...
I'd use it.
Okay, so let's do it.
Hang on, Janet.
There are procedures and protocols.
We can't...
I wasn't here.
I didn't know any of this was happening.
I told you, there's none left.
Your inaction will mean that Nate Baldwin's going to talk to the Crime Commission, which can't happen, as you well know.
We both have reputations to uphold.
I got it from my supplier,
Flynn and I administered it and now it's all gone.
There's nothing I can do.
You're as useless as a shit-flavoured lollipop, Eddie.
- Recording.
- Okay.
Zoe DiCosta.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Doctor Cooke.
- Eddie, please.
Welcome to Continuum.
- Bonnie.
You need to stay on Maxine.
- On it.
What brings you here?
Can I show you around?
I've heard good things, and I need help.
Wondered if you might be able to.
I hope so.
So, what's the problem?
Not sure if you know, but I'm coaching Greta Beckett.
Yeah, yeah.
Time triallist.
Individual pursuit.
I know.
She tore her quad last week.
- Medialis?
- Femoris.
Grade two.
And when are the Worlds?
Six weeks, but if she takes three or four weeks off to recover, her power will drop, and even down 4 or 5 watts, that's...
- First to third.
- Or fourth or even fifth.
We really need a fast recovery.
She's been good with icing?
Compression?
- Yeah.
On top of that.
- Janet?
We managed it well in the beginning, it's just now.
She's got to give herself time to get her threshold back up over 240.
But all the physios are saying another fortnight before she can pedal, and Greta's like,
"Get me back on the bike now."
Then we heard about you, the miracle man.
Have you tried PRPs?
The plasma injections?
Are they really that good?
- They certainly help.
- Full recovery?
She'll take anything, Eddie.
Well, obviously nothing on the banned list.
She still gets out-of-competition tested, but if there's anything else.
Please.
She's given up her life for this.
You know what athletes are like.
I'm sorry, but there's not much else I can offer.
Come on, Zoe.
Come on.
Think of something.
Eddie, if you help Greta win, it'll be your victory too.
And in front of the whole media, I promise, you will get the credit you deserve.
You will be the man who got her back to the starting line, and everyone in the world will know it.
Okay.
If I can help, I'll give you a call tomorrow.
She's good.
Mm, they always said she was tough to race.
No, it's all gone.
Once Tyler died and we found there was something weird about his blood, we binned it all.
I know how you hang out with the stars, their girlfriends, whoever.
And they let you.
Not because you're the fun guy, but because you sell them fun.
Whatever they want, you've got.
Now a drug that gets the Devils from last to fourth, there's got to be other buyers for that, right?
- What's your offer?
- So, you mean you do have it?
One bottle, 20 grand.
Cash.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, but it's incredible stuff.
That's the price.
Take it or leave it.
All right, I'll take it.
You're a fuckin' little shit.
You're gonna regret this.
You gettin' 20,000 off her?
- Can you loan me a grand?
- Oh, yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
It's to bail my friend Cindi out.
She really needs it.
You staying at home tonight?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
Mm-hm.
Mr Stirling, what is your argument for having this trial not proceed?
Your Honour, the negative publicity surrounding my client's case and his reputation is enormous.
It is inconceivable he can receive a fair trial in the current environment.
And in support of this submission?
Well, yes, Your Honour.
There is considerable evidence from many internet sites that I wish to present to the court.
Your Honour, do we really need to hear all of it?
Social media is not new, Mr Stirling, and the legal system has managed to operate successfully since its inception.
I appreciate that, Your Honour, but the wealth of supporting material forms a compelling basis for my submission.
Your Honour, Nate Baldwin is a very public sports figure.
It would be almost impossible to find a juror in the entire state who had never heard of him.
Indeed, yes.
Even I have heard of him.
Meaning recent coverage is unlikely to have altered anyone's opinion of him.
If cases are to be thrown out on the basis that social media creates unfair trials, well, then nothing would ever be tried in court again.
My instructions to the jury will be to take into account only evidence presented in court, not hearsay outside of it.
Therefore, press coverage cannot unduly influence them.
It is impossible for anyone to forget hearsay.
Are you suggesting I am a biased judge, Mr Stirling?
Of course not, Your Honour.
The request to have the trial not proceed is denied.
Trial will commence tomorrow at 9am.
Your Honour, I would like to make a last-minute request for a judge-only trial.
Your Honour, my learned colleague cannot keep delaying this trial.
Exactly what I was thinking.
It is in the public interest for this trial to be completely above any suspicion of bias, Your Honour.
And given the adverse publicity surrounding the trial...
Objection, Your Honour, it's the same argument.
I am not questioning the clarity or authority of your instructions to the jury, Your Honour, but their ability to adhere to them.
Very well.
Submissions to me by 9am tomorrow.
Well played, mate.
See you tomorrow.
- Can't wait.
Bring it on.
- Mm.
Can't wait for the all-nighter on a judge-only submission.
Well, he shouldn't have demolished the not-proceed option so well.
He's not really enjoying this as much as he looks.
Yes, he is.
You're enjoying it too, right?
I'm warming to it.
Maxine.
Yes, this is...
- 20,000?
- Cash.
- Did you see it at Flynn's?
- No, but I'm sure he's got some.
Or he might just want to pocket 20 grand.
We won't know for sure until we turn up with the money.
Have you got that much?
Me?
20,000 in cash?
What do I look like, an ATM machine?
What about you?
No!
Well, Nate, we could get that somehow, couldn't we?
It's just... it takes a few days to organise that much.
Right, if we're moving that amount of cash, we've got to make sure the tax office isn't looking at us.
We'll take it out in bits.
Okay, just...
look, leave it with me.
I'll sell a few things.
I'll get it together somehow.
Save all our arses, as per.
I thought we were tracking Maxine's phone.
- We are.
- I am.
So you knew she was seeing Flynn Pearce?
You didn't tell us?
How long until we can get a listening device into Flynn's?
Could take us a day to get the warrant.
Okay, forget the warrant.
That'll happen when it happens.
An hour.
Okay, do it.
Make sure it's there before she goes back.
But without a warrant, anything we record is...
Okay, you just need to shut up, all right?
The one time you should have opened your mouth is the only time in the last six weeks you've kept it closed.
In case it escaped your attention, which for an analyst there is absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here.
Against time, a manslaughter trial and Maxine Reynolds.
She buys that drug, presents it to the court, gets Nate off, we're back to square one.
That's what's at stake here and you've just put all of that in jeopardy!
I'm sorry.
I was...
Okay, what were you doing?
No, no, let me guess.
You were still trying to figure out the identity of the arsonist because you decided that was the priority, not locating the drug.
You are not running your own reference here.
You are part of a team and I am the one who dictates the direction of it, not you.
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're the smartest person in the room.
You're not.
Out.
Richard.
Can you just... just tell me, and be honest, what are his chances?
Maxine finding that drug could make all the difference, providing Flynn isn't ripping her off.
Right.
If he gets locked up, I have no money.
I have nothing.
Well, this isn't a crime that they seize assets for.
You'd still have your bank accounts, your credit cards...
I don't have any.
I don't even have this betting account that's supposedly mine.
I wish.
I mean I get my bags, make-up, shoes, all from my sponsors, who are all dumping me quick smart.
You've never had your own money?
Oh, because I'm a typical WAG who sponges off her husband and goes to the opening of an envelope?
No, no, no.
Of course not.
Do you know how we met?
In a taxi rank.
Nate had been to some do and I'd had a Mozart recital.
You like classical music?
I play it.
I went to the Conservatorium of Music.
Look...
Nate takes care of everything for me.
He looks after me.
You might want to make alternative arrangements, just in case.
He won't do that.
I'll see if I can talk some sense into him.
Thank you.
We should be online in Flynn's place now.
Want me to check?
Yes, thank you.
- Cindi needs me.
- Yeah, well, I need you.
No, you don't know what she's going through.
It's really messed up.
Welfare overpaid her and she owes 'em a grand she doesn't have and she can't get her benefits until she's paid it back.
You sure you can't help?
I'm not a charity, Pearl.
Come on, why don't... why don't you just chill out?
We can relax.
The guy that killed my brother goes on trial tomorrow.
I want to have a drink with my friend.
Sure.
You want to see Cindi, go see Cindi.
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
I just thought you needed a place to stay, that's all.
I mean, if you don't, fine, go.
I'm not keeping you locked up.
But if you go now... don't come back here.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
I want you to take your clothes off.
We can have some fun, yeah?
We don't have the warrant in place, do we?
No.
Good girl.
Good girl.
Okay.
I've heard enough.
Uh, don't forget to argue the strengths of the Westminster system.
Andy, what about your mum?
Can she pick Amal up?
Richard's just dropped an application for judge-only on us.
You know how it's underpinned by a belief juries take their responsibilities very seriously.
No, my brother can't.
His car's getting repaired.
Study after study shows this to be the case.
Yeah, well, I'll call you back in five.
Just thought I'd check in and see how you're both doing.
- All good?
- Yeah, we're on top of it.
You go.
We were just finishing up.
I don't want to lose another case with a high-profile sportsman.
We won't, but we could find a few more arguments.
No, we've got it with what you've given me.
You go see your daughter, right?
Give her a cuddle from me.
Uh, crossed wires with Andy about childcare.
First time for everything, right?
Right.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Mummy.
Yeah.
Did you give her something for the pain?
Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to work.
Oh, bub, those horrible toothy-pegs still hurting?
Oh, come here.
Hey, you've got court tomorrow.
Go to bed.
Yeah, it is tomorrow.
I just want to make sure I've got all the points in my head.
Well, it's no good if your head's asleep on the bench.
Well, I don't want Ben or Owen to think I'm not across it.
Oh, as if they would.
I've had to leave early a couple of times.
Oh, I...
I'd change my shifts but I've got three men on stress leave.
It's fine.
I can manage, Andy.
Hey, uh... you don't have to prove anything to anyone, okay?
You're doing a brilliant job.
Owen says so, Ben says so, I think so.
You stop doubting yourself.
Got a visual on Cooke again.
And someone's not too happy with him.
Mitchell Douglas, the coach of the Devils.
Now he's getting into his car.
Alone.
Didn't appear to be carrying anything.
Oh, he's heading south.
Bay Road.
- Stay on him.
- Rightio.
He's going to Flynn's.
He's going to get the drug.
- Confident.
- Where's Maxine?
Heading to the bank again.
She got 9 grand out yesterday.
- And Flynn?
- Still snoring.
Pearl's left for court.
The warrant's in place, so whatever we hear now is admissible, but we still need...
That statement from Pearl.
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thanks.
How do you think you'll go today?
Will the Devils release you from your contract?
No comment.
Please, can you give us some space?
Should be here by this afternoon.
- Tomorrow at the latest.
- Viki!
Ms Perati, do you have any comment?
My son was taken from me by that monster who pretended to be his friend.
You're sure you don't need me in there?
Yeah.
Look, Nate's got a temper, but he's not the monster they're making him out to be.
Okay?
He looked out for Ty.
This isn't fair.
You weren't a witness.
I've got to do something to help make it right, okay?
One of our boys has died.
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry, Mitchell.
- Any news?
- Close.
I believe we're very close.
Hi, Pearl.
Um, bit crazy, isn't it?
You want to get away from here?
- We'll have a chat?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Your Honour, the Westminster system is underpinned by the fact that juries take their responsibilities extremely seriously.
I mean, the average citizen is perfectly capable of putting hearsay and personal bias aside and paying serious attention to the facts presented.
Your belief in the process is commendable.
Your Honour, news feeds and social media are awash with damning indictments of the accused.
Now, this is far from normal hearsay and only a trained legal mind, such as Your Honour's, can truly ignore this bias and consider the facts, as you said yesterday.
Therefore, by your own argument, you are the only person entitled to hear this trial.
Well argued, Mr Stirling.
But don't ever try it again.
Yes, Your Honour.
I agree to the request made by Mr Stirling for a judge-only trial.
Now, gentlemen, can we declare a ceasefire and get on with this?
This must be a difficult day for you.
I can understand why you don't want to be in there, hear everything that happened.
I don't need to.
He's guilty.
He hit Ty.
They'll lock him up and then...
And then?
There'll be justice.
For Ty.
And what about you?
Don't you deserve justice?
I'm all right.
It's pretty clear what the arrangement is with Flynn.
He's 28 years old.
You're underage.
You can't legally give consent to have...
Piss off!
I can give consent whenever I want.
Don't act like this isn't my choice.
- It's... it's my life.
- It's a crime, Pearl.
In six months, it won't be.
I can get public housing on my own.
What, so sexual abuse is the price you're willing to pay for a roof over your head?
There are better options.
Yeah?
Like share houses?
You ever been in one?
Full of junkies who just take all your shit?
Or I could go back home, to Mum getting shit-faced and laying into me.
And Kevin.
Or I could, uh... sleep in a gutter or a shop door.
You think that'd be better?
Of course not, but there has to be something else, yeah?
Something better than Flynn.
There's not, but.
That's it, you see?
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.
He can help out my friend Cindi.
She's worse off than me.
I figured out a way.
I'm making it work.
It's my choice, not yours.
Pearl...
Hard copies of all the surveillance on Maxine and Eddie.
Uh, thanks, but Wayne's on Eddie.
Of course, but just in case you need to cross-reference their movements.
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
It's what I do.
I'm thorough, meticulous, on-task, 24/7, analysing data, which, to be effective, requires a broad scope.
So while my focus may appear to shift at times, it's only because every piece of information needs to be studied exhaustively.
I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't.
You should probably be explaining this to Janet.
I think it helps if the chief investigator also appreciates the particular demands of an analyst.
So I can put in a good word for you, you mean?
Oh, no.
It's just...
I get data, look for patterns.
It's puzzle solving with a real-world impact and I think it's a buzz and...
Yeah.
Bonnie, I'm kind of busy right...
Am I getting fired?
What?
Bonnie, you stuffed up.
We all do.
Just get over it and move on.
Put Wayne on.
He's gone into a chemist.
Cartwrights, Lavender Street, Granville.
Why go halfway across town to a chemist?
They're old friends and he gets a discount?
Or maybe Eddie's supplying him with peds.
Unlikely.
He's a cleanskin, according to this.
Owned by Lionel Cartwright.
Pharmacy degree, compounding chemist of 25 years.
No priors, nothing.
Eddie's on the move.
Could be in for more action now.
He's just arrived at Flynn's.
So, what did the chemist have to do with this?
We can pick up Eddie inside.
Keep a visual on him if you can, Wayne.
I told you to get rid of it.
You know what I can get for it.
I've got a better offer.
Technically you stole it from me.
Okay, I'll give you a cut.
I need it now.
How much have you got?
50ml.
I kept one bottle, that's all.
As soon as he's outside, Wayne can grab Eddie...
And risk Eddie smashing it on the road?
Losing everything?
No, let it run all the way to Zoe's.
Then we can look after it properly.
Great.
Much safer strategy.
That wasn't meant to sound patronising, honestly.
Just... genuine.
No offence.
Could you show the court what you saw when the accused hit the victim?
It was like this, to the side of Ty's face.
He stumbled, fell backwards.
Try to say something, mate.
Come on!
Come on, mate.
Ty?
So he was hit hard enough to be knocked over?
Well, yeah.
I guess so.
No further questions, Your Honour.
When the victim fell, did you hear the accused say anything?
Yeah, he said, "Sorry, mate,"
and when Ty didn't get back up, he said, "I didn't hit him that hard".
He kept saying it.
- Did you believe him?
- Yeah.
So, it's possible the blow wasn't hard enough to make the victim fall?
Yeah, maybe.
Only a...
Only what, Mr Metcalf?
Only I just remembered Tyler didn't trip.
He was lunging forward at the time, trying to grab the phone with the pictures.
One of them got that drug yet?
Maxine?
What's-her-face?
Anyone?
Look, what if I talk to 'em?
The NCC?
I don't think it'd make a difference now.
So, what's the plan from here?
I think Richard's going to call Nate as a witness.
What?
It's a chance for the judge to hear first-hand your relationship with the victim.
And risk us trapping him into saying something he shouldn't?
Why you'd never have laid into him with full force.
I thought you said you don't normally do that?
Well, he's got nothing else.
We've got no choice.
And I think you could really help yourself.
And you know Richard.
Never say die.
He'll find some angle.
He'll try and counter Nate's public image.
It'll all be about tearing down the aggro and the thuggery and showing his warm, caring side.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Well, this is Richard.
Whatever he's got will be carefully thought-out.
You think he's still got a chance?
It's still Nate Baldwin.
If we get him angry, he'll undo everything.
What the fuck do you mean you don't have it?
I mean it was for sale, and now it's been sold.
Who to?
Was it Eddie?
Fuckin' lying sack of shit.
It was a private sale.
Do you know you have had me running all around town.
I have grabbed cash every way I know how because we had a deal.
Now tell me who the hell has the drug now!
No.
You're fuckin' dead, Mr Pearce.
You're dead.
So, according to your expert analysis of the deceased's autopsy and toxicology report, could you explain for the court what the cause of death was?
A subdural haematoma.
That is, bleeding which fills the brain area rapidly, compressing brain tissue.
And what caused that haematoma?
A serious blow to the head.
A large contusion on the side of the face corresponded to where the deceased was struck.
And that was the only cause of the bleeding?
There were some anomalies in the reports regarding the failure of the deceased's blood to coagulate properly.
The cause of that was not possible to determine.
Was it a contributing factor to the death of Mr Perati?
I couldn't categorically state that, no.
Nothing further.
I think this might be able to help you.
Thanks.
2ml daily, top thigh.
Four or five days should do the trick.
And there's no chance of it testing positive?
Lots of guys were on it last year.
Passed everything.
Well, in that case, when Greta wins a medal, we'll know who to thank.
Tell the lab to be on stand-by.
We need this tested as soon as possible.
We have to be sure it's the substance that killed Tyler.
- Your witness, Mr Stirling.
- -
That's not a phone, is it, Mr Stirling?
Mr Stirling!
Your Honour, I wish to apply for an adjournment, because my instructions have been compromised.
Compromised in what way, Mr Stirling?
My client has... said something that is difficult to interpret.
You mean, he wishes to change his plea?
Your Honour, I've received mixed messages and need a private audience with my client to confirm his instructions.
If we could adjourn for the rest of the day...
Your Honour, my learned colleague only needs a minute to ask his client what he meant.
A couple of hours to advise my client calmly, ensure he understands the entirely of the situation is not unreasonable.
There are a lot of grey areas in this case.
Including the hairs you're putting on my head, Mr Stirling.
You have an hour.
So I get the cash together,
I go there and then he says he doesn't have it anymore.
I just don't know what to do.
So how's it looking your end, Richard?
Sorry, gotta go.
Oh, shit.
- Have you got it?
- Still waiting for the lab results.
If it's not here in 20 minutes, I've got to put Nate on the stand.
Well, you can stretch that out.
Go back to his childhood, his love for the game.
You used to hate it when the defence resorted to sob stories for a win.
Well, there's an exception for everything.
Good luck.
I met Tyler a couple of years ago.
He'd just been spotted in a schoolboys' team and he got into a clinic the Devils run for up-and-coming players.
I gave him some tips.
I could tell how keen he was, you know, that hunger to make it.
Anyway, he got signed on and, yeah, we hung out a bit.
You mentor a lot of younger players.
What made Tyler special?
He told me he didn't have a dad, so I, um... you know, I just...
I looked out for him, gave him advice.
He never really talked about it, but I could tell the pressure that he was under to make first grade 'cause of what that meant for his family.
The money.
I knew they were doing it tough and, you know, they counted on him to take care of them.
You're successful, wealthy.
How could you really know what that was like?
Well, I know that pressure.
An injury or something can end your career in a flash and suddenly... suddenly you've got nothin'.
So, you've gotta work your guts out to stay at the top of your form.
I know how much training and sacrifice that takes.
I've lived it.
I saw Ty live it.
I knew exactly what he wanted, 'cause it's what I've always wanted and I would never, ever have done anything to take that away from him.
So you had a real connection with him?
What?
Well, you and Tyler.
You obviously had a common bond.
We were good mates, yeah.
I mean, it sounded a lot more than that to me.
I'd imagine you get to know your fellow teammates pretty well in that locker room...
Objection, Your Honour.
Relevance.
Your Honour, I'm merely wanting to establish the intimate bonds of male teammates, which some may describe as homoerotic.
Homo what?
And the bond between Nate Baldwin and Tyler Perati, which was clearly on and off the field...
Hey, fuck off!
It wasn't like that!
I'm not gay.
You can't... you can't say that shit to me!
Objection.
This is assuming a fact not in evidence, Your Honour.
No, look, I'm just saying you've got no right to imply something like that.
Sustained.
Thank you, Mr Crown.
Withdrawn, Your Honour.
I did nothin'...wrong.
I didn't even hit him that hard.
I know I didn't.
Hey.
News?
The lab's just emailed the results.
Oh, what?
What's happening?
- It was water.
- What?
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.
But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?
Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?
What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?
- He won't.
- Whoever he sells it to will.
Serves 'em both right.
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?
Mate, Flynn was askin' 20.
What is it?
Who cares?
I found someone to buy it, that's all that matters.
When's he comin'?
Soon.
And if he doesn't turn up, there's plenty of other contacts in Flynn's phone.
And we can pay off your debt and you'll be sweet.
We could, like, get our own place and stuff, just you and me.
Fuck, it'd be so cool.
Hey, what are you doing?
It's a 20,000 trip.
You know, as if I'm not gonna try that.
- Don't be stupid.
- Oh, it'd be stupid not to!
Cindi, for fuck's sake!
No, I need that money.
Stop!
Look, he won't even notice.
Mr Baldwin.
The emotional impact of your evidence was considerable.
The bond you shared with the victim was obviously deeply felt and genuine.
Your role as a mentor and father-figure in his life is without question.
However, the strength of your relationship... cannot alter the facts presented by the autopsy and toxicology reports.
The large bruise on the deceased's body directly corresponds with the blow with which you struck him, and the size of the bruise indicates the force behind it.
I find no other contributing factors to his death, other than the punch, and so on one count of manslaughter,
I find you guilty.
Sentencing to take place at a date to be determined.
Please remove the prisoner.
Okay, although I usually don't comment on verdicts,
I am aware of recent public concern about decisions made by the DPP.
I have no doubt today's outcome will restore public confidence in the DPP and I would especially like to acknowledge the team responsible for preparing such a strong case to present to court, led by Ben McMahon.
Maybe it was Flynn.
Maybe he swapped the real drug for water.
But he's been pissed off all day, because he thinks he's lost 20 grand.
Did Eddie give Zoe the wrong bottle?
Like, an accident.
It was unlabelled.
After he went to so much trouble to get it for her?
It's unlikely.
Was Eddie onto us?
Is that possible?
Then, why go through the whole charade of giving her anything?
Why not just say no the first time she asked for it?
He's an arrogant bastard?
Was Eddie Cooke playing us?
And if he was, how involved is he in the whole thing?
Does all this link back to Eddie?
Help, somebody!
Please help!
You're all right.
Come on.
Help, somebody!
Help!
Somebody, come on, help us!
That bottle is a critical piece of evidence in a national investigation.
Now, if you want to get arrested, fine, run off.
If not, just give it to me!
I could be in here for 12 years!
I can't do it.
I've gotta spill my guts to the NCC.
That'll knock some time off.
No, not happening.
You tell them nothing.
Could Maxine be the head of the whole syndicate?
Well, that would mean she's let her own client go to jail over a drug that propped up her betting plunges.
Interesting business model.
We're too late.
I know you're looking into Tyler's death and whether there were drugs involved.
The club said you are.
I can't discuss this reference with you, Richard.
It could break causation for Nate, so if you know anything, I need to hear it.
I find there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and commit Nathaniel Baldwin to trial for manslaughter.
You are supposed to be keeping him out of jail, Richard.
I'm not getting locked up!
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.
Cindi.
Pearl.
Where's Tyler's jersey?
The Devils' jersey, it's gone.
- Yeah...
- That was my brother's!
You psycho bitch!
I'm not going back to that shithole.
No way.
Well, where else is there.
Home?
As if.
I'll figure something else out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Flynn, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She's 15.
- I know, he's a creep.
- You all good?
Yeah?
- Yeah.
This is right before the time of the fire, from a petrol station two minutes away.
That's who set fire to Wazim's house?
Has to be.
Who are you?
You mean to say you deliberately arranged extra payments outside the salary cap?
That's all.
No bets, no fixes.
We just wanted Nate.
I had to tell them about Nate, just the salary cap.
Shit.
Janet King 3x04 June 1, 2017
I've been informed that the APL has a report alleging that the Northern Devils Football Club was involved in breaching their salary cap to induce Nate Baldwin to re-sign.
I merely wish to confirm there is no direct evidence linking Pax Car Rentals to this allegation, and I'm confident that any investigation...
Great fucking timing!
Fuck this.
As sponsors, we are not privy to any of the financial arrangements the club may enter into with any of its players.
How can he get away with that?
Uh, well, he's choosing his words very carefully.
I mean, the deal was verbal.
Pax itself was never mentioned and he's fighting to keep that company afloat.
But he made a statement.
Well, it depends how much of that statement we did or didn't pass on to the APL.
And, as I'm sure you can imagine, most of Mr King's evidence had to remain confidential in order for us to conduct our investigation.
So those transcripts...
Were considerably redacted for security...
- security...
- purposes.
I don't want us giving him any favours.
"Ah, thank you, Tony." "Don't mention it, Janet."
Well, why are you helping him?
He's not your father.
No, but he's still yours.
You going to call Richard Stirling about a deal with Nate?
What?
No.
No?
He'd do anything to stop his client facing a jury right now, wouldn't he?
Thug and salary cheat, all over every news feed, and we need Nate talking.
- Thank you.
- We heard the man who forced
Clay Nelson to kill himself inside his house.
Which is why my position will be stronger when Richard calls me.
- What if he doesn't?
- Well, we'll see, right?
Anything else?
Yeah, I went to a Gender Equality in the Public Service breakfast this morning.
Owen Mitchell was telling us how he'd single-handedly raised the ratio of women at the DPP.
I thought that'd get your attention.
Anyway, we got talking and he said there was a change in prosecutors for the Baldwin trial.
And who is it now?
I thought you had a good relationship with the press?
Darling, if this was just dirt on the floor
I could sweep it under the rug.
But unfortunately, the whole bloody house is on fire.
Well, it does make an acquittal even more difficult.
- You do realise that?
- Of course I do!
God, how did this become so hard?
- What?
- Getting Nate into retirement.
- His last year at the club.
- Well, ask Graham King.
I mean, why invest all that money and then hang the club and its star player out to dry?
Okay, right now we just need to focus on getting Nate cleared.
That's the main game right now.
What are you doing?
Focusing.
Janet.
Hi.
Please, it's a simple question.
Have you identified the drug Tyler was taking before he was killed?
Is your client willing to tell us the name of the man who gave him an envelope of cash the other day, and everything he knows about match-fixing and gambling?
He might, if he was sure it meant he'd avoid jail.
It's the only chance he has.
No trial is a foregone conclusion, Janet, you know that.
And without the drug, you have little defence.
We both know that too.
So, time's ticking.
Why don't you go and advise your client how to stay out of jail, all right?
When he talks, we'll act.
Oh, and I take it you've heard about the new Crown you'll be opposing?
You've done an excellent job on the brief.
It's so strong, a three-legged dog could win it.
Woof.
Lina, if it was at all possible for you to run it, you would be.
And I'll definitely make sure you get all due credit when the time comes.
Owen!
Hi.
Sorry, Lina.
I heard there's been...
there's been a change?
Yes.
- Who?
- Guess.
What?
Richard!
How good's this, eh?
Mate against mate.
Ben McMahon.
Yep!
Former colleagues going toe to toe.
Should be fun, right?
Play nice, kids.
- So, you've had quite the rise.
- So have you.
Ah, well, mostly luck.
You know, sheer arse, really.
But you, keep seeing you pop up everywhere, hmm?
Nate Baldwin must be quite the cash cow.
He asked me to represent him, I agreed.
Simple as that.
Yeah, hey.
Hey, not your fault that you do your job, he gets off and reoffends, needs your help again, right?
Of course, you know, that wouldn't happen if the prosecution did their job properly.
Are you including yourself in that assessment?
Well, he's certainly not including me.
Yeah, we probably shouldn't be discussing Nate.
You're absolutely right, especially when everyone else is discussing it.
Doesn't exactly make it easy, right?
- Ben!
- What?
It's just a sledge.
I'll have you know, sledging is a time-honoured tradition in Australian sport.
He can take it.
Let's get a coffee.
If we track down the arsonist, he'll probably talk, giving us one of two results...
A, he's a free agent hired by Wazim, or B, he's working for the betting syndicate.
- What would you put those odds at?
- An even 50-50.
A 50% chance of getting inside the betting network.
It's still a 50% chance it'll give us nothing.
Well, what's the current plan?
Wait for Nate Baldwin to agree to a deal based on finding a drug we don't know the whereabouts of.
Which we may or may not get in time for it to be of any use.
Sounded better when Janet said it.
That's one, two, three indeterminate variables, and the issue there's obvious.
So in terms of probability, the arsonist lead is more likely to give us a favourable outcome than the drug.
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.
It's just basic probability analysis.
You should pitch it to Janet.
We don't need to cut deals.
Hey, whatever keeps me out of jail.
Now the sponsor's dumped me in it.
You can't talk to the NCC.
- Do you want to see me go down?
- No.
Well, at the moment, the only way
I'm going to stay outside is if I get hold of that drug, right?
- Yes.
- And the only chance I've got to get that drug is if I talk to 'em, right?
Well, I don't see any other way, but I'm not totally sure they can get it either.
So where does that leave us, with Nate going to jail?
That's not happening.
What if I got it?
Shit.
Could she get it?
That's the answer, isn't it?
You see, if I get the drug, he stays out of jail, doesn't have to talk to anyone.
That's problem solved.
Are you sure you can find it?
You worry about your job, Richard, and I'll worry about mine.
Okay, we need to track Maxine's phone.
Can I also remind people about the arsonist...
Later!
Just track Maxine, all right?
You think she can get it?
Hard to tell.
- Could just be Maxine shit-talk.
- That is her job.
If she knew exactly where to find it, she'd already have it.
But she knows Eddie Cooke was behind the supplement program for the Devils, like we do.
I bet that's where she's going.
She's wasting her time.
We searched every inch of Continuum and came up empty.
True, but if that drug underpinned the bet on the Devils, it has to be somewhere.
It's too valuable to completely destroy.
But would Eddie just hand over a secret drug to a sports agent?
No, he's going to want to avoid any link between him and the drug.
That'd just kill his business completely.
He's going to want a lot of assurances about anonymity, etc., before he thinks about handing it over to anyone.
But he might, eventually, to stop Nate talking.
Unless we can convince him to hand it to one of us first.
Well, not one of us, obviously.
No, somebody he thinks has absolutely nothing to do with us, like an undercover agent who goes in there as an elite athlete in need of help.
Going to need a pretty good undercover cop to pull that off.
Okay, is she?
She's going to Eddie's, isn't she?
Looks like it.
Okay, I think he keeps it off-site.
We need to watch these two, see where they go after this.
Eddie, please.
Now what's better for you?
Nate in jail, desperate to cut a deal, or Nate at home, free as a bird?
I don't know what Tyler took.
I do.
He did what he was told.
He followed the club rules to the letter because he needed that contract.
He wouldn't have done anything to jeopardise that.
So whatever he took, he got here.
I know the sports world, Eddie.
You see a lot of people, they tell me a lot of things, not least my 42 clients, but especially the five Devils.
I'm in the know, you got that?
So cut the crap and give me what you were giving them.
- There's none left.
- That's bullshit.
What, a drug that good, that gets the Devils into the semis?
As if you'd run out of that.
We'd get supplied when there was a demand, but with Tyler's death and the NCC strangling us, that demand is gone.
I don't have any left.
Well, get some more.
Okay.
I will ask my supplier, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be back, Eddie.
Hello.
Where are they?
Liam's at the sausage sizzle, and Em's at the 70 metre start.
Okay, great.
Have you spoken to Zoe yet?
Good luck.
Tom, take your mark back, then fast at the bar!
Hey, Zoe.
And drive the knee up!
Hey, Janet.
Hey, how's Emma?
Great.
Yeah, she's loving it.
Liam was too, but his ankle's still not better, so...
Don't talk to me about injuries.
Greta tore her quad last week.
Oh, no, that girl you were coaching?
Six weeks out from Worlds, ranked number two.
Last week, she's looking at a medal, now we're not even sure if she's going to make it.
That must be heartbreaking for her.
Well, yeah.
When you give up six years, stop working, count every calorie.
But I suppose in Liam's world, if he can't run at Zone, I feel sorry for him too.
Oh, don't feel sorry for him.
He's only upset because I wouldn't give him a day off school.
Um, but, look, I was hoping to have a chat, because I'm kind of involved with sport at the moment, in a funny sort of way, and given who you are and what you do,
I was hoping to pick your brains.
All right, we should grab a drink.
You deserve champers.
You nailed that brief.
Do you remember how much we used to struggle with summaries?
Oh, yeah, practice makes perfect, I guess.
No, I really shouldn't.
I've got to head back and...
Oh, come on, come on.
The bar's just around the corner, isn't it?
- Andy's got the kid, right?
- Amal, yes.
- That's a beautiful name.
- Oh, thanks.
Hey, check this.
- Oh!
- That's my wife, Bella.
- Oh, yeah, we've all seen Bella.
- And that's Remy.
Gorgeous.
I just wish I got to see them more, to be honest.
But I do most of my prep at night, you know, start mapping out my opening addresses, marking up witness statements, lines of interrogation...
You've got a two-year-old and you get all that done at night?
I'm doing well if I brush my teeth.
Well, Bella hasn't gone back to work, so she does most of the hard yards with Remy, you know?
Yeah.
I'm like a "cuddle and kiss goodnight" Dad.
I so need a wife.
- No, I'd do more.
- I wasn't criticising.
No, I'm not defending, I mean it.
I...
I wish I could do more.
I thought you weren't going to lift a finger unless Nate started talking.
Well, things changed.
Other information came to light.
But I need an assurance when we find this drug, Nate will talk.
So that was just a bluff before.
You don't have it.
And if you do find material evidence in a manslaughter trial, you'll have to hand it over anyway.
Well, things do disappear from evidence rooms from time to time.
We think we can keep your client out of jail.
Your job is to buy us the time so we can wrap this up to everyone's satisfaction, without a trial actually starting.
Richard!
How are you, mate?
- Janet?
- Hello, Ben.
Wow!
What's it been, like, four or five years?
- Yeah, something like that.
- You look great.
Thank you, and I hear you're, um... married.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, got all responsible.
Settled down.
The Premier's daughter?
So, isn't it more accurate to say she settled down, you settled up?
I'm joking.
I'm sure there's a lot of love there.
Yeah.
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Ash.
That must have been terrible.
Thank you, yes.
But hey, look how far we've all come, right?
NCC Examiner, barrister, barrister...
Future Nobel Laureate.
- Currently, mother.
- Toughest job you'll ever have.
- Stay in touch, huh?
- Yep.
- It was good to see you, Ben.
- Yeah, likewise.
See you, Janet.
Yep.
- I should go too.
- Oh!
You've gotta be kidding me, right?
You're having a drink with me.
After the trial might be more appropriate, don't you think?
Let's cross swords first and then once it's all done,
- we can catch up after that.
- Cross swords?
What sword's he got?
What sword do you have, seriously?
I mean, I couldn't even find a tooth-pick in the facts that I read.
I'm surprised you're not pleading guilty.
One more.
Come on, my shout.
And we won't mention the case again, will we?
Oh, never.
- So, you look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
You're not nervous?
Shit, I'd be nervous.
I'd be sweating more than a gypsy with a mortgage, to be honest with you.
I mean, who'd wanna be you right now?
Seriously, major trial, in the public spotlight, up against this one.
With no defence.
You got enough underwear?
Pssh, right?
You're so easy to stir.
Come on, sit down.
I'll see you later.
So you know Zoe DiCosta?
Oh, I've only met her a couple of times.
Our kids go to Tiny Track together.
Oh, wow.
Have you actually seen her gold medal race?
No, but I should look that up.
She attacked about 6K out, putting about 30 seconds between her and the peloton.
Couple of chasers went after her, but she fended them off.
She was battling a really nasty headwind for the last K and a half too, so, yeah, it was a really, really gutsy ride.
Sounds impressive.
Yeah, it was, especially as the Spaniard who took the bronze got done for doping two years later.
Really?
Yeah, see, PEDs give you that extra 1% edge, but it doesn't mean much without putting in the 99% hard work first.
Zoe was just mentally tougher.
You've got a similar grunt.
Oh, I wasn't aware I grunted.
Oh, no, no, no, it-it-it's a good thing.
Like...
like ticker.
Or hunger.
- Pluck?
- Zoe's here.
Great.
We know the man running this sports medicine clinic has used a supplement unknown to ASADA.
The question is, what does an undercover cop have to do and say to make him believe they are genuinely from the world of elite sport and then, how to ask for some of this substance?
It's not on the banned list?
No.
What does it do?
Well, we think it speeds up recovery, aids endurance.
God, if it was legal, I'd be queuing up for it now.
Greta'd kill her grandmother to get her hands on the stuff.
- Greta?
- It's one of Zoe's cyclists.
She's a total freak of nature.
VO2 touching 70, threshold 242 and a monster TSS.
- W-what?
- Training Stress Score.
It's sort of a number that rates your workout.
But unfortunately, she's injured at the moment, right?
Getting over a torn quad, so her normalised power's still down about 5% to 8%, and Worlds are just around the corner.
So, it's a race against time.
Is it ever.
I think we've seen about 11 doctors, tried just about everything.
At this point, if they said, "Take arsenic,"
she probably would.
And risk death?
If it would fix her, probably worth it.
That's the way Greta's thinking.
All those sacrifices.
It's...
Well, yeah.
If I told her I could get her something not on the banned list that could get her to Worlds, she'd beg me for it.
Now, we should get all this down for the cop so that they sound like they've got the right shorthand and describe exactly what they're looking for, sound genuine.
Sure.
I mean, it would also really help if whoever we choose has a background in sport.
You know any former footballers, basketballers, someone like that on the force?
So, you've got no idea what this stuff is?
None.
Just say, for example... just say I was asking for it,
I wouldn't be asking for a banned substance, right?
No one's going to suggest that you...
Well, hang on a second.
Let's just think about it for a minute.
I mean, okay, let's say that you...
You never met us, but you'd heard that this guy,
Eddie Cooke, he'd been getting great results and his athletes were passing all the tests.
I'd want to know what it was and where I could get it.
Okay, let's say he just gave you something in a bottle.
Even when I was racing, you're mad to take whatever anyone gives you, but you can't be on your guard the whole time.
No, so you would just take it somewhere first, to find out exactly what it was.
If I didn't know what it was, totally, yeah.
I'd have to, for my own reputation.
- Right.
- I'd happily do that.
I mean, I haven't asked for anything I knew is banned, and if it should be and we end up catching a drug cheat, great.
And if it turned out that it actually did help with recovery, wasn't performance enhancing...
I'd use it.
Okay, so let's do it.
Hang on, Janet.
There are procedures and protocols.
We can't...
I wasn't here.
I didn't know any of this was happening.
I told you, there's none left.
Your inaction will mean that Nate Baldwin's going to talk to the Crime Commission, which can't happen, as you well know.
We both have reputations to uphold.
I got it from my supplier,
Flynn and I administered it and now it's all gone.
There's nothing I can do.
You're as useless as a shit-flavoured lollipop, Eddie.
- Recording.
- Okay.
Zoe DiCosta.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Doctor Cooke.
- Eddie, please.
Welcome to Continuum.
- Bonnie.
You need to stay on Maxine.
- On it.
What brings you here?
Can I show you around?
I've heard good things, and I need help.
Wondered if you might be able to.
I hope so.
So, what's the problem?
Not sure if you know, but I'm coaching Greta Beckett.
Yeah, yeah.
Time triallist.
Individual pursuit.
I know.
She tore her quad last week.
- Medialis?
- Femoris.
Grade two.
And when are the Worlds?
Six weeks, but if she takes three or four weeks off to recover, her power will drop, and even down 4 or 5 watts, that's...
- First to third.
- Or fourth or even fifth.
We really need a fast recovery.
She's been good with icing?
Compression?
- Yeah.
On top of that.
- Janet?
We managed it well in the beginning, it's just now.
She's got to give herself time to get her threshold back up over 240.
But all the physios are saying another fortnight before she can pedal, and Greta's like,
"Get me back on the bike now."
Then we heard about you, the miracle man.
Have you tried PRPs?
The plasma injections?
Are they really that good?
- They certainly help.
- Full recovery?
She'll take anything, Eddie.
Well, obviously nothing on the banned list.
She still gets out-of-competition tested, but if there's anything else.
Please.
She's given up her life for this.
You know what athletes are like.
I'm sorry, but there's not much else I can offer.
Come on, Zoe.
Come on.
Think of something.
Eddie, if you help Greta win, it'll be your victory too.
And in front of the whole media, I promise, you will get the credit you deserve.
You will be the man who got her back to the starting line, and everyone in the world will know it.
Okay.
If I can help, I'll give you a call tomorrow.
She's good.
Mm, they always said she was tough to race.
No, it's all gone.
Once Tyler died and we found there was something weird about his blood, we binned it all.
I know how you hang out with the stars, their girlfriends, whoever.
And they let you.
Not because you're the fun guy, but because you sell them fun.
Whatever they want, you've got.
Now a drug that gets the Devils from last to fourth, there's got to be other buyers for that, right?
- What's your offer?
- So, you mean you do have it?
One bottle, 20 grand.
Cash.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, but it's incredible stuff.
That's the price.
Take it or leave it.
All right, I'll take it.
You're a fuckin' little shit.
You're gonna regret this.
You gettin' 20,000 off her?
- Can you loan me a grand?
- Oh, yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
It's to bail my friend Cindi out.
She really needs it.
You staying at home tonight?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
Mm-hm.
Mr Stirling, what is your argument for having this trial not proceed?
Your Honour, the negative publicity surrounding my client's case and his reputation is enormous.
It is inconceivable he can receive a fair trial in the current environment.
And in support of this submission?
Well, yes, Your Honour.
There is considerable evidence from many internet sites that I wish to present to the court.
Your Honour, do we really need to hear all of it?
Social media is not new, Mr Stirling, and the legal system has managed to operate successfully since its inception.
I appreciate that, Your Honour, but the wealth of supporting material forms a compelling basis for my submission.
Your Honour, Nate Baldwin is a very public sports figure.
It would be almost impossible to find a juror in the entire state who had never heard of him.
Indeed, yes.
Even I have heard of him.
Meaning recent coverage is unlikely to have altered anyone's opinion of him.
If cases are to be thrown out on the basis that social media creates unfair trials, well, then nothing would ever be tried in court again.
My instructions to the jury will be to take into account only evidence presented in court, not hearsay outside of it.
Therefore, press coverage cannot unduly influence them.
It is impossible for anyone to forget hearsay.
Are you suggesting I am a biased judge, Mr Stirling?
Of course not, Your Honour.
The request to have the trial not proceed is denied.
Trial will commence tomorrow at 9am.
Your Honour, I would like to make a last-minute request for a judge-only trial.
Your Honour, my learned colleague cannot keep delaying this trial.
Exactly what I was thinking.
It is in the public interest for this trial to be completely above any suspicion of bias, Your Honour.
And given the adverse publicity surrounding the trial...
Objection, Your Honour, it's the same argument.
I am not questioning the clarity or authority of your instructions to the jury, Your Honour, but their ability to adhere to them.
Very well.
Submissions to me by 9am tomorrow.
Well played, mate.
See you tomorrow.
- Can't wait.
Bring it on.
- Mm.
Can't wait for the all-nighter on a judge-only submission.
Well, he shouldn't have demolished the not-proceed option so well.
He's not really enjoying this as much as he looks.
Yes, he is.
You're enjoying it too, right?
I'm warming to it.
Maxine.
Yes, this is...
- 20,000?
- Cash.
- Did you see it at Flynn's?
- No, but I'm sure he's got some.
Or he might just want to pocket 20 grand.
We won't know for sure until we turn up with the money.
Have you got that much?
Me?
20,000 in cash?
What do I look like, an ATM machine?
What about you?
No!
Well, Nate, we could get that somehow, couldn't we?
It's just... it takes a few days to organise that much.
Right, if we're moving that amount of cash, we've got to make sure the tax office isn't looking at us.
We'll take it out in bits.
Okay, just...
look, leave it with me.
I'll sell a few things.
I'll get it together somehow.
Save all our arses, as per.
I thought we were tracking Maxine's phone.
- We are.
- I am.
So you knew she was seeing Flynn Pearce?
You didn't tell us?
How long until we can get a listening device into Flynn's?
Could take us a day to get the warrant.
Okay, forget the warrant.
That'll happen when it happens.
An hour.
Okay, do it.
Make sure it's there before she goes back.
But without a warrant, anything we record is...
Okay, you just need to shut up, all right?
The one time you should have opened your mouth is the only time in the last six weeks you've kept it closed.
In case it escaped your attention, which for an analyst there is absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here.
Against time, a manslaughter trial and Maxine Reynolds.
She buys that drug, presents it to the court, gets Nate off, we're back to square one.
That's what's at stake here and you've just put all of that in jeopardy!
I'm sorry.
I was...
Okay, what were you doing?
No, no, let me guess.
You were still trying to figure out the identity of the arsonist because you decided that was the priority, not locating the drug.
You are not running your own reference here.
You are part of a team and I am the one who dictates the direction of it, not you.
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're the smartest person in the room.
You're not.
Out.
_
Richard.
Can you just... just tell me, and be honest, what are his chances?
Maxine finding that drug could make all the difference, providing Flynn isn't ripping her off.
Right.
If he gets locked up, I have no money.
I have nothing.
Well, this isn't a crime that they seize assets for.
You'd still have your bank accounts, your credit cards...
I don't have any.
I don't even have this betting account that's supposedly mine.
I wish.
I mean I get my bags, make-up, shoes, all from my sponsors, who are all dumping me quick smart.
You've never had your own money?
Oh, because I'm a typical WAG who sponges off her husband and goes to the opening of an envelope?
No, no, no.
Of course not.
Do you know how we met?
In a taxi rank.
Nate had been to some do and I'd had a Mozart recital.
You like classical music?
I play it.
I went to the Conservatorium of Music.
Look...
Nate takes care of everything for me.
He looks after me.
You might want to make alternative arrangements, just in case.
He won't do that.
I'll see if I can talk some sense into him.
Thank you.
We should be online in Flynn's place now.
Want me to check?
Yes, thank you.
- Cindi needs me.
- Yeah, well, I need you.
No, you don't know what she's going through.
It's really messed up.
Welfare overpaid her and she owes 'em a grand she doesn't have and she can't get her benefits until she's paid it back.
You sure you can't help?
I'm not a charity, Pearl.
Come on, why don't... why don't you just chill out?
We can relax.
The guy that killed my brother goes on trial tomorrow.
I want to have a drink with my friend.
Sure.
You want to see Cindi, go see Cindi.
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
I just thought you needed a place to stay, that's all.
I mean, if you don't, fine, go.
I'm not keeping you locked up.
But if you go now... don't come back here.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
I want you to take your clothes off.
We can have some fun, yeah?
We don't have the warrant in place, do we?
No.
Good girl.
Good girl.
Okay.
I've heard enough.
Uh, don't forget to argue the strengths of the Westminster system.
Andy, what about your mum?
Can she pick Amal up?
Richard's just dropped an application for judge-only on us.
You know how it's underpinned by a belief juries take their responsibilities very seriously.
No, my brother can't.
His car's getting repaired.
Study after study shows this to be the case.
Yeah, well, I'll call you back in five.
Just thought I'd check in and see how you're both doing.
- All good?
- Yeah, we're on top of it.
You go.
We were just finishing up.
I don't want to lose another case with a high-profile sportsman.
We won't, but we could find a few more arguments.
No, we've got it with what you've given me.
You go see your daughter, right?
Give her a cuddle from me.
Uh, crossed wires with Andy about childcare.
First time for everything, right?
Right.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Mummy.
Yeah.
Did you give her something for the pain?
Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to work.
Oh, bub, those horrible toothy-pegs still hurting?
Oh, come here.
Hey, you've got court tomorrow.
Go to bed.
Yeah, it is tomorrow.
I just want to make sure I've got all the points in my head.
Well, it's no good if your head's asleep on the bench.
Well, I don't want Ben or Owen to think I'm not across it.
Oh, as if they would.
I've had to leave early a couple of times.
Oh, I...
I'd change my shifts but I've got three men on stress leave.
It's fine.
I can manage, Andy.
Hey, uh... you don't have to prove anything to anyone, okay?
You're doing a brilliant job.
Owen says so, Ben says so, I think so.
You stop doubting yourself.
Got a visual on Cooke again.
And someone's not too happy with him.
Mitchell Douglas, the coach of the Devils.
Now he's getting into his car.
Alone.
Didn't appear to be carrying anything.
Oh, he's heading south.
Bay Road.
- Stay on him.
- Rightio.
He's going to Flynn's.
He's going to get the drug.
- Confident.
- Where's Maxine?
Heading to the bank again.
She got 9 grand out yesterday.
- And Flynn?
- Still snoring.
Pearl's left for court.
The warrant's in place, so whatever we hear now is admissible, but we still need...
That statement from Pearl.
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thanks.
How do you think you'll go today?
Will the Devils release you from your contract?
No comment.
Please, can you give us some space?
Should be here by this afternoon.
- Tomorrow at the latest.
- Viki!
Ms Perati, do you have any comment?
My son was taken from me by that monster who pretended to be his friend.
You're sure you don't need me in there?
Yeah.
Look, Nate's got a temper, but he's not the monster they're making him out to be.
Okay?
He looked out for Ty.
This isn't fair.
You weren't a witness.
I've got to do something to help make it right, okay?
One of our boys has died.
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry, Mitchell.
- Any news?
- Close.
I believe we're very close.
Hi, Pearl.
Um, bit crazy, isn't it?
You want to get away from here?
- We'll have a chat?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Your Honour, the Westminster system is underpinned by the fact that juries take their responsibilities extremely seriously.
I mean, the average citizen is perfectly capable of putting hearsay and personal bias aside and paying serious attention to the facts presented.
Your belief in the process is commendable.
Your Honour, news feeds and social media are awash with damning indictments of the accused.
Now, this is far from normal hearsay and only a trained legal mind, such as Your Honour's, can truly ignore this bias and consider the facts, as you said yesterday.
Therefore, by your own argument, you are the only person entitled to hear this trial.
Well argued, Mr Stirling.
But don't ever try it again.
Yes, Your Honour.
I agree to the request made by Mr Stirling for a judge-only trial.
Now, gentlemen, can we declare a ceasefire and get on with this?
This must be a difficult day for you.
I can understand why you don't want to be in there, hear everything that happened.
I don't need to.
He's guilty.
He hit Ty.
They'll lock him up and then...
And then?
There'll be justice.
For Ty.
And what about you?
Don't you deserve justice?
I'm all right.
It's pretty clear what the arrangement is with Flynn.
He's 28 years old.
You're underage.
You can't legally give consent to have...
Piss off!
I can give consent whenever I want.
Don't act like this isn't my choice.
- It's... it's my life.
- It's a crime, Pearl.
In six months, it won't be.
I can get public housing on my own.
What, so sexual abuse is the price you're willing to pay for a roof over your head?
There are better options.
Yeah?
Like share houses?
You ever been in one?
Full of junkies who just take all your shit?
Or I could go back home, to Mum getting shit-faced and laying into me.
And Kevin.
Or I could, uh... sleep in a gutter or a shop door.
You think that'd be better?
Of course not, but there has to be something else, yeah?
Something better than Flynn.
There's not, but.
That's it, you see?
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.
He can help out my friend Cindi.
She's worse off than me.
I figured out a way.
I'm making it work.
It's my choice, not yours.
Pearl...
Hard copies of all the surveillance on Maxine and Eddie.
Uh, thanks, but Wayne's on Eddie.
Of course, but just in case you need to cross-reference their movements.
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
It's what I do.
I'm thorough, meticulous, on-task, 24/7, analysing data, which, to be effective, requires a broad scope.
So while my focus may appear to shift at times, it's only because every piece of information needs to be studied exhaustively.
I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't.
You should probably be explaining this to Janet.
I think it helps if the chief investigator also appreciates the particular demands of an analyst.
So I can put in a good word for you, you mean?
Oh, no.
It's just...
I get data, look for patterns.
It's puzzle solving with a real-world impact and I think it's a buzz and...
Yeah.
Bonnie, I'm kind of busy right...
Am I getting fired?
What?
Bonnie, you stuffed up.
We all do.
Just get over it and move on.
Put Wayne on.
He's gone into a chemist.
Cartwrights, Lavender Street, Granville.
Why go halfway across town to a chemist?
They're old friends and he gets a discount?
Or maybe Eddie's supplying him with peds.
Unlikely.
He's a cleanskin, according to this.
Owned by Lionel Cartwright.
Pharmacy degree, compounding chemist of 25 years.
No priors, nothing.
Eddie's on the move.
Could be in for more action now.
He's just arrived at Flynn's.
So, what did the chemist have to do with this?
We can pick up Eddie inside.
Keep a visual on him if you can, Wayne.
I told you to get rid of it.
You know what I can get for it.
I've got a better offer.
Technically you stole it from me.
Okay, I'll give you a cut.
I need it now.
How much have you got?
50ml.
I kept one bottle, that's all.
As soon as he's outside, Wayne can grab Eddie...
And risk Eddie smashing it on the road?
Losing everything?
No, let it run all the way to Zoe's.
Then we can look after it properly.
Great.
Much safer strategy.
That wasn't meant to sound patronising, honestly.
Just... genuine.
No offence.
Could you show the court what you saw when the accused hit the victim?
It was like this, to the side of Ty's face.
He stumbled, fell backwards.
Try to say something, mate.
Come on!
Come on, mate.
Ty?
So he was hit hard enough to be knocked over?
Well, yeah.
I guess so.
No further questions, Your Honour.
When the victim fell, did you hear the accused say anything?
Yeah, he said, "Sorry, mate,"
and when Ty didn't get back up, he said, "I didn't hit him that hard".
He kept saying it.
- Did you believe him?
- Yeah.
So, it's possible the blow wasn't hard enough to make the victim fall?
Yeah, maybe.
Only a...
Only what, Mr Metcalf?
Only I just remembered Tyler didn't trip.
He was lunging forward at the time, trying to grab the phone with the pictures.
One of them got that drug yet?
Maxine?
What's-her-face?
Anyone?
Look, what if I talk to 'em?
The NCC?
I don't think it'd make a difference now.
So, what's the plan from here?
I think Richard's going to call Nate as a witness.
What?
It's a chance for the judge to hear first-hand your relationship with the victim.
And risk us trapping him into saying something he shouldn't?
Why you'd never have laid into him with full force.
I thought you said you don't normally do that?
Well, he's got nothing else.
We've got no choice.
And I think you could really help yourself.
And you know Richard.
Never say die.
He'll find some angle.
He'll try and counter Nate's public image.
It'll all be about tearing down the aggro and the thuggery and showing his warm, caring side.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Well, this is Richard.
Whatever he's got will be carefully thought-out.
You think he's still got a chance?
It's still Nate Baldwin.
If we get him angry, he'll undo everything.
What the fuck do you mean you don't have it?
I mean it was for sale, and now it's been sold.
Who to?
Was it Eddie?
Fuckin' lying sack of shit.
It was a private sale.
Do you know you have had me running all around town.
I have grabbed cash every way I know how because we had a deal.
Now tell me who the hell has the drug now!
No.
You're fuckin' dead, Mr Pearce.
You're dead.
So, according to your expert analysis of the deceased's autopsy and toxicology report, could you explain for the court what the cause of death was?
A subdural haematoma.
That is, bleeding which fills the brain area rapidly, compressing brain tissue.
And what caused that haematoma?
A serious blow to the head.
A large contusion on the side of the face corresponded to where the deceased was struck.
And that was the only cause of the bleeding?
There were some anomalies in the reports regarding the failure of the deceased's blood to coagulate properly.
The cause of that was not possible to determine.
Was it a contributing factor to the death of Mr Perati?
I couldn't categorically state that, no.
Nothing further.
I think this might be able to help you.
Thanks.
2ml daily, top thigh.
Four or five days should do the trick.
And there's no chance of it testing positive?
Lots of guys were on it last year.
Passed everything.
Well, in that case, when Greta wins a medal, we'll know who to thank.
Tell the lab to be on stand-by.
We need this tested as soon as possible.
We have to be sure it's the substance that killed Tyler.
- Your witness, Mr Stirling.
- _
That's not a phone, is it, Mr Stirling?
Mr Stirling!
Your Honour, I wish to apply for an adjournment, because my instructions have been compromised.
Compromised in what way, Mr Stirling?
My client has... ..said something that is difficult to interpret.
You mean, he wishes to change his plea?
Your Honour, I've received mixed messages and need a private audience with my client to confirm his instructions.
If we could adjourn for the rest of the day...
Your Honour, my learned colleague only needs a minute to ask his client what he meant.
A couple of hours to advise my client calmly, ensure he understands the entirely of the situation is not unreasonable.
There are a lot of grey areas in this case.
Including the hairs you're putting on my head, Mr Stirling.
You have an hour.
So I get the cash together,
I go there and then he says he doesn't have it anymore.
I just don't know what to do.
So how's it looking your end, Richard?
Sorry, gotta go.
Oh, shit.
- Have you got it?
- Still waiting for the lab results.
If it's not here in 20 minutes, I've got to put Nate on the stand.
Well, you can stretch that out.
Go back to his childhood, his love for the game.
You used to hate it when the defence resorted to sob stories for a win.
Well, there's an exception for everything.
Good luck.
I met Tyler a couple of years ago.
He'd just been spotted in a schoolboys' team and he got into a clinic the Devils run for up-and-coming players.
I gave him some tips.
I could tell how keen he was, you know, that hunger to make it.
Anyway, he got signed on and, yeah, we hung out a bit.
You mentor a lot of younger players.
What made Tyler special?
He told me he didn't have a dad, so I, um... you know, I just...
I looked out for him, gave him advice.
He never really talked about it, but I could tell the pressure that he was under to make first grade 'cause of what that meant for his family.
The money.
I knew they were doing it tough and, you know, they counted on him to take care of them.
You're successful, wealthy.
How could you really know what that was like?
Well, I know that pressure.
An injury or something can end your career in a flash and suddenly... suddenly you've got nothin'.
So, you've gotta work your guts out to stay at the top of your form.
I know how much training and sacrifice that takes.
I've lived it.
I saw Ty live it.
I knew exactly what he wanted, 'cause it's what I've always wanted and I would never, ever have done anything to take that away from him.
So you had a real connection with him?
What?
Well, you and Tyler.
You obviously had a common bond.
We were good mates, yeah.
I mean, it sounded a lot more than that to me.
I'd imagine you get to know your fellow teammates pretty well in that locker room...
Objection, Your Honour.
Relevance.
Your Honour, I'm merely wanting to establish the intimate bonds of male teammates, which some may describe as homoerotic.
Homo what?
And the bond between Nate Baldwin and Tyler Perati, which was clearly on and off the field...
Hey, fuck off!
It wasn't like that!
I'm not gay.
You can't... you can't say that shit to me!
Objection.
This is assuming a fact not in evidence, Your Honour.
No, look, I'm just saying you've got no right to imply something like that.
Sustained.
Thank you, Mr Crown.
Withdrawn, Your Honour.
I did nothin'...wrong.
I didn't even hit him that hard.
I know I didn't.
Hey.
News?
The lab's just emailed the results.
Oh, what?
What's happening?
- It was water.
- What?
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.
But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?
Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?
What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?
- He won't.
- Whoever he sells it to will.
Serves 'em both right.
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?
Mate, Flynn was askin' 20.
What is it?
Who cares?
I found someone to buy it, that's all that matters.
When's he comin'?
Soon.
And if he doesn't turn up, there's plenty of other contacts in Flynn's phone.
And we can pay off your debt and you'll be sweet.
We could, like, get our own place and stuff, just you and me.
Fuck, it'd be so cool.
Hey, what are you doing?
It's a 20,000 trip.
You know, as if I'm not gonna try that.
- Don't be stupid.
- Oh, it'd be stupid not to!
Cindi, for fuck's sake!
No, I need that money.
Stop!
Look, he won't even notice.
Mr Baldwin.
The emotional impact of your evidence was considerable.
The bond you shared with the victim was obviously deeply felt and genuine.
Your role as a mentor and father-figure in his life is without question.
However, the strength of your relationship... cannot alter the facts presented by the autopsy and toxicology reports.
The large bruise on the deceased's body directly corresponds with the blow with which you struck him, and the size of the bruise indicates the force behind it.
I find no other contributing factors to his death, other than the punch, and so on one count of manslaughter,
I find you guilty.
Sentencing to take place at a date to be determined.
Please remove the prisoner.
Okay, although I usually don't comment on verdicts,
I am aware of recent public concern about decisions made by the DPP.
I have no doubt today's outcome will restore public confidence in the DPP and I would especially like to acknowledge the team responsible for preparing such a strong case to present to court, led by Ben McMahon.
Maybe it was Flynn.
Maybe he swapped the real drug for water.
But he's been pissed off all day, because he thinks he's lost 20 grand.
Did Eddie give Zoe the wrong bottle?
Like, an accident.
It was unlabelled.
After he went to so much trouble to get it for her?
It's unlikely.
Was Eddie onto us?
Is that possible?
Then, why go through the whole charade of giving her anything?
Why not just say no the first time she asked for it?
He's an arrogant bastard?
Was Eddie Cooke playing us?
And if he was, how involved is he in the whole thing?
Does all this link back to Eddie?
Help, somebody!
Please help!
You're all right.
Come on.
Help, somebody!
Help!
Somebody, come on, help us!
That bottle is a critical piece of evidence in a national investigation.
Now, if you want to get arrested, fine, run off.
If not, just give it to me!
I could be in here for 12 years!
I can't do it.
I've gotta spill my guts to the NCC.
That'll knock some time off.
No, not happening.
You tell them nothing.
Could Maxine be the head of the whole syndicate?
Well, that would mean she's let her own client go to jail over a drug that propped up her betting plunges.
Interesting business model.
We're too late.
(SHOUTS)
RICHARD:
I know you're looking into Tyler's death and whether there were drugs involved.
The club said you are.
I can't discuss this reference with you, Richard.
It could break causation for Nate, so if you know anything, I need to hear it.
I find there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and commit Nathaniel Baldwin to trial for manslaughter.
You are supposed to be keeping him out of jail, Richard.
I'm not getting locked up!
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.
Cindi.
Pearl.
Where's Tyler's jersey?
The Devils' jersey, it's gone.
- Yeah...
- That was my brother's!
You psycho bitch!
I'm not going back to that shithole.
No way.
Well, where else is there.
Home?
As if.
I'll figure something else out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Flynn, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- BIANCA:
She's 15.
- I know, he's a creep.
- You all good?
Yeah?
- Yeah.
This is right before the time of the fire, from a petrol station two minutes away.
TRACEY:
That's who set fire to Wazim's house?
Has to be.
Who are you?
You mean to say you deliberately arranged extra payments outside the salary cap?
That's all.
No bets, no fixes.
We just wanted Nate.
I had to tell them about Nate, just the salary cap.
Shit.
Janet King 3x04 June 1, 2017
I've been informed that the APL has a report alleging that the Northern Devils Football Club was involved in breaching their salary cap to induce Nate Baldwin to re-sign.
I merely wish to confirm there is no direct evidence linking Pax Car Rentals to this allegation, and I'm confident that any investigation...
Great fucking timing!
Fuck this.
As sponsors, we are not privy to any of the financial arrangements the club may enter into with any of its players.
How can he get away with that?
Uh, well, he's choosing his words very carefully.
I mean, the deal was verbal.
Pax itself was never mentioned and he's fighting to keep that company afloat.
But he made a statement.
Well, it depends how much of that statement we did or didn't pass on to the APL.
And, as I'm sure you can imagine, most of Mr King's evidence had to remain confidential in order for us to conduct our investigation.
So those transcripts...
Were considerably redacted for security...
- security...
- purposes.
I don't want us giving him any favours.
"Ah, thank you, Tony." "Don't mention it, Janet."
Well, why are you helping him?
He's not your father.
No, but he's still yours.
You going to call Richard Stirling about a deal with Nate?
What?
No.
No?
He'd do anything to stop his client facing a jury right now, wouldn't he?
Thug and salary cheat, all over every news feed, and we need Nate talking.
- Thank you.
- We heard the man who forced
Clay Nelson to kill himself inside his house.
Which is why my position will be stronger when Richard calls me.
- What if he doesn't?
- Well, we'll see, right?
Anything else?
Yeah, I went to a Gender Equality in the Public Service breakfast this morning.
Owen Mitchell was telling us how he'd single-handedly raised the ratio of women at the DPP.
I thought that'd get your attention.
Anyway, we got talking and he said there was a change in prosecutors for the Baldwin trial.
And who is it now?
I thought you had a good relationship with the press?
Darling, if this was just dirt on the floor
I could sweep it under the rug.
But unfortunately, the whole bloody house is on fire.
Well, it does make an acquittal even more difficult.
- You do realise that?
- Of course I do!
God, how did this become so hard?
- What?
- Getting Nate into retirement.
- His last year at the club.
- Well, ask Graham King.
I mean, why invest all that money and then hang the club and its star player out to dry?
Okay, right now we just need to focus on getting Nate cleared.
That's the main game right now.
What are you doing?
Focusing.
Janet.
Hi.
Please, it's a simple question.
Have you identified the drug Tyler was taking before he was killed?
Is your client willing to tell us the name of the man who gave him an envelope of cash the other day, and everything he knows about match-fixing and gambling?
He might, if he was sure it meant he'd avoid jail.
It's the only chance he has.
No trial is a foregone conclusion, Janet, you know that.
And without the drug, you have little defence.
We both know that too.
So, time's ticking.
Why don't you go and advise your client how to stay out of jail, all right?
When he talks, we'll act.
Oh, and I take it you've heard about the new Crown you'll be opposing?
OWEN:
You've done an excellent job on the brief.
It's so strong, a three-legged dog could win it.
LINA:
Woof.
Lina, if it was at all possible for you to run it, you would be.
And I'll definitely make sure you get all due credit when the time comes.
Owen!
Hi.
Sorry, Lina.
I heard there's been...
there's been a change?
Yes.
- Who?
- LINA:
Guess.
What?
Richard!
How good's this, eh?
Mate against mate.
Ben McMahon.
Yep!
Former colleagues going toe to toe.
Should be fun, right?
Play nice, kids.
- So, you've had quite the rise.
- So have you.
Ah, well, mostly luck.
You know, sheer arse, really.
But you, keep seeing you pop up everywhere, hmm?
Nate Baldwin must be quite the cash cow.
He asked me to represent him, I agreed.
Simple as that.
Yeah, hey.
Hey, not your fault that you do your job, he gets off and reoffends, needs your help again, right?
Of course, you know, that wouldn't happen if the prosecution did their job properly.
Are you including yourself in that assessment?
Well, he's certainly not including me.
Yeah, we probably shouldn't be discussing Nate.
You're absolutely right, especially when everyone else is discussing it.
Doesn't exactly make it easy, right?
- Ben!
- What?
It's just a sledge.
I'll have you know, sledging is a time-honoured tradition in Australian sport.
He can take it.
Let's get a coffee.
BONNIE:
If we track down the arsonist, he'll probably talk, giving us one of two results...
A, he's a free agent hired by Wazim, or B, he's working for the betting syndicate.
- What would you put those odds at?
- An even 50-50.
A 50% chance of getting inside the betting network.
It's still a 50% chance it'll give us nothing.
Well, what's the current plan?
Wait for Nate Baldwin to agree to a deal based on finding a drug we don't know the whereabouts of.
Which we may or may not get in time for it to be of any use.
Sounded better when Janet said it.
That's one, two, three indeterminate variables, and the issue there's obvious.
So in terms of probability, the arsonist lead is more likely to give us a favourable outcome than the drug.
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.
It's just basic probability analysis.
You should pitch it to Janet.
MAXINE:
We don't need to cut deals.
Hey, whatever keeps me out of jail.
Now the sponsor's dumped me in it.
MAXINE (ON RECORDING):
You can't talk to the NCC.
- Do you want to see me go down?
- No.
Well, at the moment, the only way
I'm going to stay outside is if I get hold of that drug, right?
- RICHARD:
Yes.
- And the only chance I've got to get that drug is if I talk to 'em, right?
Well, I don't see any other way, but I'm not totally sure they can get it either.
LUCY:
So where does that leave us, with Nate going to jail?
That's not happening.
What if I got it?
Shit.
Could she get it?
MAXINE:
That's the answer, isn't it?
You see, if I get the drug, he stays out of jail, doesn't have to talk to anyone.
That's problem solved.
Are you sure you can find it?
You worry about your job, Richard, and I'll worry about mine.
Okay, we need to track Maxine's phone.
Can I also remind people about the arsonist...
Later!
Just track Maxine, all right?
You think she can get it?
Hard to tell.
- Could just be Maxine shit-talk.
- That is her job.
If she knew exactly where to find it, she'd already have it.
But she knows Eddie Cooke was behind the supplement program for the Devils, like we do.
I bet that's where she's going.
She's wasting her time.
We searched every inch of Continuum and came up empty.
True, but if that drug underpinned the bet on the Devils, it has to be somewhere.
It's too valuable to completely destroy.
But would Eddie just hand over a secret drug to a sports agent?
No, he's going to want to avoid any link between him and the drug.
That'd just kill his business completely.
He's going to want a lot of assurances about anonymity, etc., before he thinks about handing it over to anyone.
But he might, eventually, to stop Nate talking.
Unless we can convince him to hand it to one of us first.
Well, not one of us, obviously.
No, somebody he thinks has absolutely nothing to do with us, like an undercover agent who goes in there as an elite athlete in need of help.
Going to need a pretty good undercover cop to pull that off.
Okay, is she?
She's going to Eddie's, isn't she?
Looks like it.
Okay, I think he keeps it off-site.
We need to watch these two, see where they go after this.
(SCREEN BEEPS)
MAXINE:
Eddie, please.
Now what's better for you?
Nate in jail, desperate to cut a deal, or Nate at home, free as a bird?
I don't know what Tyler took.
I do.
He did what he was told.
He followed the club rules to the letter because he needed that contract.
He wouldn't have done anything to jeopardise that.
So whatever he took, he got here.
I know the sports world, Eddie.
You see a lot of people, they tell me a lot of things, not least my 42 clients, but especially the five Devils.
I'm in the know, you got that?
So cut the crap and give me what you were giving them.
- There's none left.
- (SCOFFS) That's bullshit.
What, a drug that good, that gets the Devils into the semis?
As if you'd run out of that.
We'd get supplied when there was a demand, but with Tyler's death and the NCC strangling us, that demand is gone.
I don't have any left.
Well, get some more.
Okay.
I will ask my supplier, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be back, Eddie.
Hello.
Where are they?
Liam's at the sausage sizzle, and Em's at the 70 metre start.
Okay, great.
Have you spoken to Zoe yet?
Good luck.
ZOE:
Tom, take your mark back, then fast at the bar!
Hey, Zoe.
And drive the knee up!
Hey, Janet.
Hey, how's Emma?
Great.
Yeah, she's loving it.
Liam was too, but his ankle's still not better, so...
Don't talk to me about injuries.
Greta tore her quad last week.
Oh, no, that girl you were coaching?
Six weeks out from Worlds, ranked number two.
Last week, she's looking at a medal, now we're not even sure if she's going to make it.
That must be heartbreaking for her.
Well, yeah.
When you give up six years, stop working, count every calorie.
But I suppose in Liam's world, if he can't run at Zone, I feel sorry for him too.
Oh, don't feel sorry for him.
He's only upset because I wouldn't give him a day off school.
Um, but, look, I was hoping to have a chat, because I'm kind of involved with sport at the moment, in a funny sort of way, and given who you are and what you do,
I was hoping to pick your brains.
All right, we should grab a drink.
You deserve champers.
You nailed that brief.
Do you remember how much we used to struggle with summaries?
Oh, yeah, practice makes perfect, I guess.
No, I really shouldn't.
I've got to head back and...
Oh, come on, come on.
The bar's just around the corner, isn't it?
- Andy's got the kid, right?
- Amal, yes.
- That's a beautiful name.
- Oh, thanks.
Hey, check this.
- Oh!
- That's my wife, Bella.
- Oh, yeah, we've all seen Bella.
- And that's Remy.
Gorgeous.
I just wish I got to see them more, to be honest.
But I do most of my prep at night, you know, start mapping out my opening addresses, marking up witness statements, lines of interrogation...
You've got a two-year-old and you get all that done at night?
I'm doing well if I brush my teeth.
Well, Bella hasn't gone back to work, so she does most of the hard yards with Remy, you know?
Yeah.
I'm like a "cuddle and kiss goodnight" Dad.
I so need a wife.
- No, I'd do more.
- I wasn't criticising.
No, I'm not defending, I mean it.
I...
I wish I could do more.
I thought you weren't going to lift a finger unless Nate started talking.
Well, things changed.
Other information came to light.
But I need an assurance when we find this drug, Nate will talk.
So that was just a bluff before.
You don't have it.
And if you do find material evidence in a manslaughter trial, you'll have to hand it over anyway.
Well, things do disappear from evidence rooms from time to time.
We think we can keep your client out of jail.
Your job is to buy us the time so we can wrap this up to everyone's satisfaction, without a trial actually starting.
Richard!
How are you, mate?
- Janet?
- Hello, Ben.
Wow!
What's it been, like, four or five years?
- Yeah, something like that.
- You look great.
Thank you, and I hear you're, um... married.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, got all responsible.
Settled down.
The Premier's daughter?
So, isn't it more accurate to say she settled down, you settled up?
I'm joking.
I'm sure there's a lot of love there.
Yeah.
Hey, I was sorry to hear about Ash.
That must have been terrible.
Thank you, yes.
But hey, look how far we've all come, right?
NCC Examiner, barrister, barrister...
Future Nobel Laureate.
- Currently, mother.
- Toughest job you'll ever have.
- Stay in touch, huh?
- Yep.
- It was good to see you, Ben.
- Yeah, likewise.
See you, Janet.
Yep.
- I should go too.
- Oh!
You've gotta be kidding me, right?
You're having a drink with me.
After the trial might be more appropriate, don't you think?
Let's cross swords first and then once it's all done,
- we can catch up after that.
- Cross swords?
What sword's he got?
What sword do you have, seriously?
I mean, I couldn't even find a tooth-pick in the facts that I read.
I'm surprised you're not pleading guilty.
One more.
Come on, my shout.
And we won't mention the case again, will we?
Oh, never.
- So, you look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
You're not nervous?
Shit, I'd be nervous.
I'd be sweating more than a gypsy with a mortgage, to be honest with you.
I mean, who'd wanna be you right now?
Seriously, major trial, in the public spotlight, up against this one.
With no defence.
You got enough underwear?
(CHUCKLES) Pssh, right?
You're so easy to stir.
Come on, sit down.
I'll see you later.
WAYNE:
So you know Zoe DiCosta?
Oh, I've only met her a couple of times.
Our kids go to Tiny Track together.
Oh, wow.
Have you actually seen her gold medal race?
No, but I should look that up.
She attacked about 6K out, putting about 30 seconds between her and the peloton.
Couple of chasers went after her, but she fended them off.
She was battling a really nasty headwind for the last K and a half too, so, yeah, it was a really, really gutsy ride.
Sounds impressive.
Yeah, it was, especially as the Spaniard who took the bronze got done for doping two years later.
Really?
Yeah, see, PEDs give you that extra 1% edge, but it doesn't mean much without putting in the 99% hard work first.
Zoe was just mentally tougher.
You've got a similar grunt.
Oh, I wasn't aware I grunted.
Oh, no, no, no, it-it-it's a good thing.
Like...
like ticker.
Or hunger.
- Pluck?
- BIANCA:
Zoe's here.
Great.
We know the man running this sports medicine clinic has used a supplement unknown to ASADA.
The question is, what does an undercover cop have to do and say to make him believe they are genuinely from the world of elite sport and then, how to ask for some of this substance?
It's not on the banned list?
No.
What does it do?
Well, we think it speeds up recovery, aids endurance.
God, if it was legal, I'd be queuing up for it now.
Greta'd kill her grandmother to get her hands on the stuff.
- Greta?
- It's one of Zoe's cyclists.
She's a total freak of nature.
VO2 touching 70, threshold 242 and a monster TSS.
- W-what?
- Training Stress Score.
It's sort of a number that rates your workout.
But unfortunately, she's injured at the moment, right?
Getting over a torn quad, so her normalised power's still down about 5% to 8%, and Worlds are just around the corner.
So, it's a race against time.
Is it ever.
I think we've seen about 11 doctors, tried just about everything.
At this point, if they said, "Take arsenic,"
she probably would.
And risk death?
If it would fix her, probably worth it.
That's the way Greta's thinking.
All those sacrifices.
It's...
Well, yeah.
If I told her I could get her something not on the banned list that could get her to Worlds, she'd beg me for it.
Now, we should get all this down for the cop so that they sound like they've got the right shorthand and describe exactly what they're looking for, sound genuine.
Sure.
I mean, it would also really help if whoever we choose has a background in sport.
You know any former footballers, basketballers, someone like that on the force?
So, you've got no idea what this stuff is?
None.
Just say, for example... just say I was asking for it,
I wouldn't be asking for a banned substance, right?
No one's going to suggest that you...
Well, hang on a second.
Let's just think about it for a minute.
I mean, okay, let's say that you...
You never met us, but you'd heard that this guy,
Eddie Cooke, he'd been getting great results and his athletes were passing all the tests.
I'd want to know what it was and where I could get it.
Okay, let's say he just gave you something in a bottle.
Even when I was racing, you're mad to take whatever anyone gives you, but you can't be on your guard the whole time.
No, so you would just take it somewhere first, to find out exactly what it was.
If I didn't know what it was, totally, yeah.
I'd have to, for my own reputation.
- Right.
- I'd happily do that.
I mean, I haven't asked for anything I knew is banned, and if it should be and we end up catching a drug cheat, great.
And if it turned out that it actually did help with recovery, wasn't performance enhancing...
I'd use it.
Okay, so let's do it.
Hang on, Janet.
There are procedures and protocols.
We can't...
I wasn't here.
I didn't know any of this was happening.
I told you, there's none left.
Your inaction will mean that Nate Baldwin's going to talk to the Crime Commission, which can't happen, as you well know.
We both have reputations to uphold.
I got it from my supplier,
Flynn and I administered it and now it's all gone.
There's nothing I can do.
You're as useless as a shit-flavoured lollipop, Eddie.
- BIANCA:
Recording.
- Okay.
EDDIE (ON RECORDING):
Zoe DiCosta.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- ZOE:
Doctor Cooke.
- EDDIE:
Eddie, please.
Welcome to Continuum.
- Bonnie.
You need to stay on Maxine.
- On it.
What brings you here?
Can I show you around?
I've heard good things, and I need help.
Wondered if you might be able to.
I hope so.
So, what's the problem?
Not sure if you know, but I'm coaching Greta Beckett.
Yeah, yeah.
Time triallist.
Individual pursuit.
I know.
She tore her quad last week.
- Medialis?
- Femoris.
Grade two.
And when are the Worlds?
Six weeks, but if she takes three or four weeks off to recover, her power will drop, and even down 4 or 5 watts, that's...
- First to third.
- Or fourth or even fifth.
We really need a fast recovery.
She's been good with icing?
Compression?
- Yeah.
On top of that.
- Janet?
We managed it well in the beginning, it's just now.
She's got to give herself time to get her threshold back up over 240.
But all the physios are saying another fortnight before she can pedal, and Greta's like,
"Get me back on the bike now."
Then we heard about you, the miracle man.
Have you tried PRPs?
The plasma injections?
Are they really that good?
- They certainly help.
- Full recovery?
She'll take anything, Eddie.
Well, obviously nothing on the banned list.
She still gets out-of-competition tested, but if there's anything else.
Please.
She's given up her life for this.
You know what athletes are like.
I'm sorry, but there's not much else I can offer.
Come on, Zoe.
Come on.
Think of something.
Eddie, if you help Greta win, it'll be your victory too.
And in front of the whole media, I promise, you will get the credit you deserve.
You will be the man who got her back to the starting line, and everyone in the world will know it.
Okay.
If I can help, I'll give you a call tomorrow.
She's good.
Mm, they always said she was tough to race.
FLYNN:
No, it's all gone.
Once Tyler died and we found there was something weird about his blood, we binned it all.
I know how you hang out with the stars, their girlfriends, whoever.
And they let you.
Not because you're the fun guy, but because you sell them fun.
Whatever they want, you've got.
Now a drug that gets the Devils from last to fourth, there's got to be other buyers for that, right?
- What's your offer?
- So, you mean you do have it?
One bottle, 20 grand.
Cash.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, but it's incredible stuff.
That's the price.
Take it or leave it.
All right, I'll take it.
You're a fuckin' little shit.
You're gonna regret this.
You gettin' 20,000 off her?
- Can you loan me a grand?
- Oh, yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
It's to bail my friend Cindi out.
She really needs it.
You staying at home tonight?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
Mm-hm.
JUDGE WALKER:
Mr Stirling, what is your argument for having this trial not proceed?
Your Honour, the negative publicity surrounding my client's case and his reputation is enormous.
It is inconceivable he can receive a fair trial in the current environment.
And in support of this submission?
Well, yes, Your Honour.
There is considerable evidence from many internet sites that I wish to present to the court.
Your Honour, do we really need to hear all of it?
Social media is not new, Mr Stirling, and the legal system has managed to operate successfully since its inception.
I appreciate that, Your Honour, but the wealth of supporting material forms a compelling basis for my submission.
Your Honour, Nate Baldwin is a very public sports figure.
It would be almost impossible to find a juror in the entire state who had never heard of him.
Indeed, yes.
Even I have heard of him.
Meaning recent coverage is unlikely to have altered anyone's opinion of him.
If cases are to be thrown out on the basis that social media creates unfair trials, well, then nothing would ever be tried in court again.
My instructions to the jury will be to take into account only evidence presented in court, not hearsay outside of it.
Therefore, press coverage cannot unduly influence them.
It is impossible for anyone to forget hearsay.
Are you suggesting I am a biased judge, Mr Stirling?
Of course not, Your Honour.
The request to have the trial not proceed is denied.
Trial will commence tomorrow at 9am.
Your Honour, I would like to make a last-minute request for a judge-only trial.
Your Honour, my learned colleague cannot keep delaying this trial.
Exactly what I was thinking.
It is in the public interest for this trial to be completely above any suspicion of bias, Your Honour.
And given the adverse publicity surrounding the trial...
Objection, Your Honour, it's the same argument.
I am not questioning the clarity or authority of your instructions to the jury, Your Honour, but their ability to adhere to them.
Very well.
Submissions to me by 9am tomorrow.
Well played, mate.
See you tomorrow.
- Can't wait.
Bring it on.
- Mm.
Can't wait for the all-nighter on a judge-only submission.
Well, he shouldn't have demolished the not-proceed option so well.
He's not really enjoying this as much as he looks.
Yes, he is.
You're enjoying it too, right?
I'm warming to it.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Maxine.
Yes, this is...
- RICHARD: 20,000?
- MAXINE:
Cash.
- Did you see it at Flynn's?
- No, but I'm sure he's got some.
NATE:
Or he might just want to pocket 20 grand.
MAXINE:
We won't know for sure until we turn up with the money.
RICHARD:
Have you got that much?
MAXINE:
Me?
20,000 in cash?
What do I look like, an ATM machine?
What about you?
No!
Well, Nate, we could get that somehow, couldn't we?
It's just... it takes a few days to organise that much.
Right, if we're moving that amount of cash, we've got to make sure the tax office isn't looking at us.
We'll take it out in bits.
Okay, just...
look, leave it with me.
I'll sell a few things.
I'll get it together somehow.
Save all our arses, as per.
I thought we were tracking Maxine's phone.
- BIANCA:
We are.
- I am.
So you knew she was seeing Flynn Pearce?
You didn't tell us?
How long until we can get a listening device into Flynn's?
Could take us a day to get the warrant.
Okay, forget the warrant.
That'll happen when it happens.
An hour.
Okay, do it.
Make sure it's there before she goes back.
But without a warrant, anything we record is...
Okay, you just need to shut up, all right?
The one time you should have opened your mouth is the only time in the last six weeks you've kept it closed.
In case it escaped your attention, which for an analyst there is absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here.
Against time, a manslaughter trial and Maxine Reynolds.
She buys that drug, presents it to the court, gets Nate off, we're back to square one.
That's what's at stake here and you've just put all of that in jeopardy!
I'm sorry.
I was...
Okay, what were you doing?
No, no, let me guess.
You were still trying to figure out the identity of the arsonist because you decided that was the priority, not locating the drug.
You are not running your own reference here.
You are part of a team and I am the one who dictates the direction of it, not you.
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're the smartest person in the room.
You're not.
Out.
LUCY:
Richard.
Can you just... just tell me, and be honest, what are his chances?
Maxine finding that drug could make all the difference, providing Flynn isn't ripping her off.
Right.
If he gets locked up, I have no money.
I have nothing.
Well, this isn't a crime that they seize assets for.
You'd still have your bank accounts, your credit cards...
I don't have any.
I don't even have this betting account that's supposedly mine.
I wish.
I mean I get my bags, make-up, shoes, all from my sponsors, who are all dumping me quick smart.
You've never had your own money?
Oh, because I'm a typical WAG who sponges off her husband and goes to the opening of an envelope?
No, no, no.
Of course not.
Do you know how we met?
In a taxi rank.
Nate had been to some do and I'd had a Mozart recital.
You like classical music?
I play it.
I went to the Conservatorium of Music.
Look...
Nate takes care of everything for me.
He looks after me.
You might want to make alternative arrangements, just in case.
He won't do that.
I'll see if I can talk some sense into him.
Thank you.
We should be online in Flynn's place now.
Want me to check?
Yes, thank you.
- PEARL:
Cindi needs me.
- FLYNN:
Yeah, well, I need you.
PEARL:
No, you don't know what she's going through.
It's really messed up.
Welfare overpaid her and she owes 'em a grand she doesn't have and she can't get her benefits until she's paid it back.
You sure you can't help?
I'm not a charity, Pearl.
Come on, why don't... why don't you just chill out?
We can relax.
The guy that killed my brother goes on trial tomorrow.
I want to have a drink with my friend.
Sure.
You want to see Cindi, go see Cindi.
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
I just thought you needed a place to stay, that's all.
I mean, if you don't, fine, go.
I'm not keeping you locked up.
But if you go now... don't come back here.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
I want you to take your clothes off.
We can have some fun, yeah?
We don't have the warrant in place, do we?
No.
Good girl.
Good girl.
Okay.
I've heard enough.
Uh, don't forget to argue the strengths of the Westminster system.
Andy, what about your mum?
Can she pick Amal up?
Richard's just dropped an application for judge-only on us.
You know how it's underpinned by a belief juries take their responsibilities very seriously.
No, my brother can't.
His car's getting repaired.
Study after study shows this to be the case.
Yeah, well, I'll call you back in five.
OWEN:
Just thought I'd check in and see how you're both doing.
- All good?
- Yeah, we're on top of it.
You go.
We were just finishing up.
I don't want to lose another case with a high-profile sportsman.
We won't, but we could find a few more arguments.
No, we've got it with what you've given me.
You go see your daughter, right?
Give her a cuddle from me.
Uh, crossed wires with Andy about childcare.
First time for everything, right?
Right.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
AMAL:
Mummy.
Yeah.
Did you give her something for the pain?
Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to work.
Oh, bub, those horrible toothy-pegs still hurting?
Oh, come here.
Hey, you've got court tomorrow.
Go to bed.
Yeah, it is tomorrow.
I just want to make sure I've got all the points in my head.
Well, it's no good if your head's asleep on the bench.
Well, I don't want Ben or Owen to think I'm not across it.
Oh, as if they would.
I've had to leave early a couple of times.
Oh, I...
I'd change my shifts but I've got three men on stress leave.
It's fine.
I can manage, Andy.
Hey, uh... you don't have to prove anything to anyone, okay?
You're doing a brilliant job.
Owen says so, Ben says so, I think so.
You stop doubting yourself.
WAYNE:
Got a visual on Cooke again.
And someone's not too happy with him.
Mitchell Douglas, the coach of the Devils.
Now he's getting into his car.
Alone.
Didn't appear to be carrying anything.
Oh, he's heading south.
Bay Road.
- JANET:
Stay on him.
- Rightio.
He's going to Flynn's.
He's going to get the drug.
- Confident.
- Where's Maxine?
Heading to the bank again.
She got 9 grand out yesterday.
- And Flynn?
- Still snoring.
Pearl's left for court.
The warrant's in place, so whatever we hear now is admissible, but we still need...
That statement from Pearl.
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thanks.
JOURNALIST:
How do you think you'll go today?
Will the Devils release you from your contract?
No comment.
Please, can you give us some space?
(QUIETLY) Should be here by this afternoon.
- Tomorrow at the latest.
- Viki!
Ms Perati, do you have any comment?
My son was taken from me by that monster who pretended to be his friend.
MITCHELL:
You're sure you don't need me in there?
Yeah.
Look, Nate's got a temper, but he's not the monster they're making him out to be.
Okay?
He looked out for Ty.
This isn't fair.
You weren't a witness.
I've got to do something to help make it right, okay?
One of our boys has died.
He was just a kid.
I'm sorry, Mitchell.
- Any news?
- Close.
I believe we're very close.
Hi, Pearl.
Um, bit crazy, isn't it?
You want to get away from here?
- We'll have a chat?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Your Honour, the Westminster system is underpinned by the fact that juries take their responsibilities extremely seriously.
I mean, the average citizen is perfectly capable of putting hearsay and personal bias aside and paying serious attention to the facts presented.
Your belief in the process is commendable.
Your Honour, news feeds and social media are awash with damning indictments of the accused.
Now, this is far from normal hearsay and only a trained legal mind, such as Your Honour's, can truly ignore this bias and consider the facts, as you said yesterday.
Therefore, by your own argument, you are the only person entitled to hear this trial.
Well argued, Mr Stirling.
But don't ever try it again.
Yes, Your Honour.
I agree to the request made by Mr Stirling for a judge-only trial.
Now, gentlemen, can we declare a ceasefire and get on with this?
JANET:
This must be a difficult day for you.
I can understand why you don't want to be in there, hear everything that happened.
I don't need to.
He's guilty.
He hit Ty.
They'll lock him up and then...
And then?
There'll be justice.
For Ty.
And what about you?
Don't you deserve justice?
I'm all right.
It's pretty clear what the arrangement is with Flynn.
He's 28 years old.
You're underage.
You can't legally give consent to have...
Piss off!
I can give consent whenever I want.
Don't act like this isn't my choice.
- It's... it's my life.
- It's a crime, Pearl.
In six months, it won't be.
I can get public housing on my own.
What, so sexual abuse is the price you're willing to pay for a roof over your head?
There are better options.
Yeah?
Like share houses?
You ever been in one?
Full of junkies who just take all your shit?
Or I could go back home, to Mum getting shit-faced and laying into me.
And Kevin.
Or I could, uh... sleep in a gutter or a shop door.
You think that'd be better?
Of course not, but there has to be something else, yeah?
Something better than Flynn.
There's not, but.
That's it, you see?
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.
He can help out my friend Cindi.
She's worse off than me.
I figured out a way.
I'm making it work.
It's my choice, not yours.
Pearl...
Hard copies of all the surveillance on Maxine and Eddie.
Uh, thanks, but Wayne's on Eddie.
Of course, but just in case you need to cross-reference their movements.
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
It's what I do.
I'm thorough, meticulous, on-task, 24/7, analysing data, which, to be effective, requires a broad scope.
So while my focus may appear to shift at times, it's only because every piece of information needs to be studied exhaustively.
I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't.
You should probably be explaining this to Janet.
I think it helps if the chief investigator also appreciates the particular demands of an analyst.
So I can put in a good word for you, you mean?
Oh, no.
It's just...
I get data, look for patterns.
It's puzzle solving with a real-world impact and I think it's a buzz and...
Yeah.
Bonnie, I'm kind of busy right...
Am I getting fired?
What?
Bonnie, you stuffed up.
We all do.
Just get over it and move on.
JANET:
Put Wayne on.
WAYNE:
He's gone into a chemist.
Cartwrights, Lavender Street, Granville.
Why go halfway across town to a chemist?
They're old friends and he gets a discount?
Or maybe Eddie's supplying him with peds.
Unlikely.
He's a cleanskin, according to this.
Owned by Lionel Cartwright.
Pharmacy degree, compounding chemist of 25 years.
No priors, nothing.
Eddie's on the move.
Could be in for more action now.
He's just arrived at Flynn's.
So, what did the chemist have to do with this?
We can pick up Eddie inside.
Keep a visual on him if you can, Wayne.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
EDDIE:
I told you to get rid of it.
FLYNN:
You know what I can get for it.
I've got a better offer.
Technically you stole it from me.
Okay, I'll give you a cut.
I need it now.
How much have you got?
50ml.
I kept one bottle, that's all.
As soon as he's outside, Wayne can grab Eddie...
And risk Eddie smashing it on the road?
Losing everything?
No, let it run all the way to Zoe's.
Then we can look after it properly.
Great.
Much safer strategy.
That wasn't meant to sound patronising, honestly.
Just... genuine.
No offence.
BEN:
Could you show the court what you saw when the accused hit the victim?
It was like this, to the side of Ty's face.
He stumbled, fell backwards.
MITCHELL:
Try to say something, mate.
Come on!
Come on, mate.
Ty?
So he was hit hard enough to be knocked over?
Well, yeah.
I guess so.
No further questions, Your Honour.
When the victim fell, did you hear the accused say anything?
Yeah, he said, "Sorry, mate,"
and when Ty didn't get back up, he said, "I didn't hit him that hard".
He kept saying it.
- Did you believe him?
- Yeah.
So, it's possible the blow wasn't hard enough to make the victim fall?
Yeah, maybe.
Only a...
Only what, Mr Metcalf?
Only I just remembered Tyler didn't trip.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
He was lunging forward at the time, trying to grab the phone with the pictures.
One of them got that drug yet?
Maxine?
What's-her-face?
Anyone?
Look, what if I talk to 'em?
The NCC?
I don't think it'd make a difference now.
So, what's the plan from here?
I think Richard's going to call Nate as a witness.
What?
It's a chance for the judge to hear first-hand your relationship with the victim.
And risk us trapping him into saying something he shouldn't?
Why you'd never have laid into him with full force.
I thought you said you don't normally do that?
Well, he's got nothing else.
We've got no choice.
And I think you could really help yourself.
And you know Richard.
Never say die.
He'll find some angle.
He'll try and counter Nate's public image.
It'll all be about tearing down the aggro and the thuggery and showing his warm, caring side.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Well, this is Richard.
Whatever he's got will be carefully thought-out.
You think he's still got a chance?
It's still Nate Baldwin.
If we get him angry, he'll undo everything.
MAXINE:
What the fuck do you mean you don't have it?
FLYNN:
I mean it was for sale, and now it's been sold.
Who to?
Was it Eddie?
Fuckin' lying sack of shit.
It was a private sale.
Do you know you have had me running all around town.
I have grabbed cash every way I know how because we had a deal.
Now tell me who the hell has the drug now!
No.
You're fuckin' dead, Mr Pearce.
You're dead.
(DOOR SLAMS)
So, according to your expert analysis of the deceased's autopsy and toxicology report, could you explain for the court what the cause of death was?
A subdural haematoma.
That is, bleeding which fills the brain area rapidly, compressing brain tissue.
And what caused that haematoma?
A serious blow to the head.
A large contusion on the side of the face corresponded to where the deceased was struck.
And that was the only cause of the bleeding?
There were some anomalies in the reports regarding the failure of the deceased's blood to coagulate properly.
The cause of that was not possible to determine.
Was it a contributing factor to the death of Mr Perati?
I couldn't categorically state that, no.
Nothing further.
EDDIE:
I think this might be able to help you.
ZOE:
Thanks.
2ml daily, top thigh.
Four or five days should do the trick.
And there's no chance of it testing positive?
Lots of guys were on it last year.
Passed everything.
Well, in that case, when Greta wins a medal, we'll know who to thank.
Tell the lab to be on stand-by.
We need this tested as soon as possible.
We have to be sure it's the substance that killed Tyler.
- JUDGE WALKER:
Your witness, Mr Stirling.
- -
That's not a phone, is it, Mr Stirling?
Mr Stirling!
Your Honour, I wish to apply for an adjournment, because my instructions have been compromised.
Compromised in what way, Mr Stirling?
My client has... said something that is difficult to interpret.
You mean, he wishes to change his plea?
Your Honour, I've received mixed messages and need a private audience with my client to confirm his instructions.
If we could adjourn for the rest of the day...
Your Honour, my learned colleague only needs a minute to ask his client what he meant.
A couple of hours to advise my client calmly, ensure he understands the entirely of the situation is not unreasonable.
There are a lot of grey areas in this case.
Including the hairs you're putting on my head, Mr Stirling.
You have an hour.
So I get the cash together,
I go there and then he says he doesn't have it anymore.
I just don't know what to do.
So how's it looking your end, Richard?
Sorry, gotta go.
Oh, shit.
- Have you got it?
- Still waiting for the lab results.
If it's not here in 20 minutes, I've got to put Nate on the stand.
Well, you can stretch that out.
Go back to his childhood, his love for the game.
You used to hate it when the defence resorted to sob stories for a win.
Well, there's an exception for everything.
Good luck.
NATE:
I met Tyler a couple of years ago.
He'd just been spotted in a schoolboys' team and he got into a clinic the Devils run for up-and-coming players.
I gave him some tips.
I could tell how keen he was, you know, that hunger to make it.
Anyway, he got signed on and, yeah, we hung out a bit.
You mentor a lot of younger players.
What made Tyler special?
He told me he didn't have a dad, so I, um... you know, I just...
I looked out for him, gave him advice.
He never really talked about it, but I could tell the pressure that he was under to make first grade 'cause of what that meant for his family.
The money.
I knew they were doing it tough and, you know, they counted on him to take care of them.
You're successful, wealthy.
How could you really know what that was like?
Well, I know that pressure.
An injury or something can end your career in a flash and suddenly... suddenly you've got nothin'.
So, you've gotta work your guts out to stay at the top of your form.
I know how much training and sacrifice that takes.
I've lived it.
I saw Ty live it.
I knew exactly what he wanted, 'cause it's what I've always wanted and I would never, ever have done anything to take that away from him.
BEN:
So you had a real connection with him?
What?
Well, you and Tyler.
You obviously had a common bond.
We were good mates, yeah.
I mean, it sounded a lot more than that to me.
I'd imagine you get to know your fellow teammates pretty well in that locker room...
Objection, Your Honour.
Relevance.
Your Honour, I'm merely wanting to establish the intimate bonds of male teammates, which some may describe as homoerotic.
Homo what?
And the bond between Nate Baldwin and Tyler Perati, which was clearly on and off the field...
Hey, fuck off!
It wasn't like that!
I'm not gay.
You can't... you can't say that shit to me!
Objection.
This is assuming a fact not in evidence, Your Honour.
No, look, I'm just saying you've got no right to imply something like that.
Sustained.
Thank you, Mr Crown.
Withdrawn, Your Honour.
I did nothin'...wrong.
I didn't even hit him that hard.
I know I didn't.
Hey.
News?
The lab's just emailed the results.
Oh, what?
What's happening?
H2O.
- It was water.
- What?
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.
But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?
CINDI:
Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?
What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?
- He won't.
- Whoever he sells it to will.
Serves 'em both right.
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?
Mate, Flynn was askin' 20.
What is it?
Who cares?
I found someone to buy it, that's all that matters.
When's he comin'?
Soon.
And if he doesn't turn up, there's plenty of other contacts in Flynn's phone.
And we can pay off your debt and you'll be sweet.
We could, like, get our own place and stuff, just you and me.
Fuck, it'd be so cool.
Hey, what are you doing?
It's a 20,000 trip.
You know, as if I'm not gonna try that.
- Don't be stupid.
- Oh, it'd be stupid not to!
Cindi, for fuck's sake!
No, I need that money.
Stop!
Look, he won't even notice.
(COUGHS AND LAUGHS)
Mr Baldwin.
The emotional impact of your evidence was considerable.
The bond you shared with the victim was obviously deeply felt and genuine.
Your role as a mentor and father-figure in his life is without question.
However, the strength of your relationship... cannot alter the facts presented by the autopsy and toxicology reports.
The large bruise on the deceased's body directly corresponds with the blow with which you struck him, and the size of the bruise indicates the force behind it.
I find no other contributing factors to his death, other than the punch, and so on one count of manslaughter,
I find you guilty.
Sentencing to take place at a date to be determined.
Please remove the prisoner.
(CAMERAS CLICK)
Okay, although I usually don't comment on verdicts,
I am aware of recent public concern about decisions made by the DPP.
I have no doubt today's outcome will restore public confidence in the DPP and I would especially like to acknowledge the team responsible for preparing such a strong case to present to court, led by Ben McMahon.
Maybe it was Flynn.
Maybe he swapped the real drug for water.
But he's been pissed off all day, because he thinks he's lost 20 grand.
Did Eddie give Zoe the wrong bottle?
Like, an accident.
It was unlabelled.
After he went to so much trouble to get it for her?
It's unlikely.
Was Eddie onto us?
Is that possible?
Then, why go through the whole charade of giving her anything?
Why not just say no the first time she asked for it?
He's an arrogant bastard?
Was Eddie Cooke playing us?
And if he was, how involved is he in the whole thing?
- (CRASH!
) - (TYRES SCREECH, GLASS SHATTERS)
Does all this link back to Eddie?
Help, somebody!
Please help!
You're all right.
Come on.
Help, somebody!
Help!
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)
Somebody, come on, help us!
That bottle is a critical piece of evidence in a national investigation.
Now, if you want to get arrested, fine, run off.
If not, just give it to me!
I could be in here for 12 years!
I can't do it.
I've gotta spill my guts to the NCC.
That'll knock some time off.
No, not happening.
You tell them nothing.
Could Maxine be the head of the whole syndicate?
Well, that would mean she's let her own client go to jail over a drug that propped up her betting plunges.
Interesting business model.
We're too late.
I'm Louie's father, and I want him back.
The birth parent almost always wins guardianship.
I want to meet my son.
You have every right to meet your son, but this visit is as far as it goes.
- He's over an hour late.
- Wouldn't be the first time
I saw someone back out.
We have a leukemia patient who's having trouble finding a genetic match.
Where do I sign?
Kelly's your donor.
My God.
We had to take Anna off chemo.
That's it?
You just let her die?
I'm sorry, Kelly.
You spent a couple days in jail, and now you're changing your own oil?
Just keeping busy.
How's your head?
It's fine.
I heard you stopped by Med the other day to see Anna.
She wouldn't see me.
No.
It was us that wouldn't let you see her.
At the time, you represented hope for her, Kelly.
Did something happen?
No, no, not that.
But yes, something did.
Her neutrophil count came up overnight, and we started her back on chemo this morning.
We want to take another shot at the bone marrow transplant.
I mean, assuming we still have a donor.
Not even a question.
Yeah, in 24 hours, we think she'll be strong enough to do it.
That's... that's great news.
Truck 81, Engine 51.
All right, buddy.
You go be a hero.
I'm gonna schedule your donation for tomorrow.
- All right.
- 7110 South St. Lawrence.
Help!
Please!
Maggie's trapped upstairs!
- Where?
- Up there!
- Severide, Squad!
- On it!
- Anybody else up there?
- No.
Casey, vent the roof.
Buy some time for Squad.
Fast but safe.
Truck, let's get this roof open.
Copy that, Lieutenant.
51, let's get a ladder in there.
Let's go!
Mouch, get that ladder up on the roof now!
Cruz, you stay here.
I'll get her out.
All right.
Got it.
Fire department!
Call out!
In here!
Give me your hand.
Let's get out of here.
Take my hand.
Stay low.
Okay, just come out, all right?
I got you.
I got you.
Come on.
Go slow.
Easy.
Easy, that's it.
I got you.
One step at a time.
There you go.
Hey, Chief, how's that roof vent going?
We're working on it.
Two minutes.
That's it.
One step at a time.
Ambo!
Battalion 25 to Main.
I need another ambulance to my location right now!
Kelly!
Kelly?
Copy that, Battalion 25.
Positional ambo en route.
Kelly!
Kelly.
Kelly, can you hear me?
Kelly!
- Gabby, talk to me.
- He's breathing, but his pulse is weak and thready.
We got him.
35-year-old male firefighter jumped from a second-story window on a call.
GCS 14, positive LOC, moving all extremities, pressure's 90 over 60, heart rate 100.
16 Gauge in both arms.
We're in this room.
Watch the corner.
On my count.
One, two, three.
Get blood.
Hang a liter of LR in the rapid transfuser.
Chest X-ray, then pelvis.
We're gonna roll him.
One, two, three.
Pan scan once we get his pressure up.
We got him from here.
Okay?
I'll let you know.
Hey.
How is he?
Still out.
They gave him pain meds.
They're doing an X-ray and CT.
So, there is good news.
He's moving his hands and feet, so we can rule out paralysis.
What's the bad news?
There might not be any.
I'll keep you guys posted.
Okay, I know we all want to stay, but there's work to do out there.
Understood, Chief.
Chief, he... he shouldn't wake up alone.
Okay.
I'll tell Casey that you are staying behind.
Thank you.
I'll call you as soon as I hear anything.
Yep.
How dare you show your face here?
- Look, it's not what you think.
- Casey.
No, no, no, no, no.
We're done with you, Andre.
You had your chance.
- I understand you're angry.
- Hey!
Hey!
We're done.
This is over.
Come on.
But you want to hear this.
Trust me.
I'm redeploying next week.
What?
Back to Afghanistan.
The day I was supposed to meet Louie, I got the call.
It's a long deployment, and it could get extended.
I'm here because I wanted to tell you in person...
That...
I'm signing away my parental rights.
You two are good for him, you know, it's... it's obvious.
Are you sure about this?
I...
I am.
Take good care of my son.
Please.
What took you so long?
We're at Med?
No.
No.
We're at Disneyland.
I need better drugs, then.
Docs say you got a concussion, couple bumps and bruises, but all in all, you got off pretty easy.
Doesn't feel like it.
Well, you could've used the ladder.
You know, just saved us all a bunch of stress.
Next time.
I'm gonna go get Clarke.
He'll want to know you're awake.
Stella?
Thank you.
Okay, some good news.
I have just talked to Kidd.
Severide is awake and stable.
All right.
Concussion, some bruising on the spine, but no long-term damage.
He is alert and in good spirits.
That doesn't sound like Severide.
He also said do not let Capp sleep in his bed.
He sounds fine to me.
Hey, Chief,
I was hoping to run something by you.
Yeah.
Make it quick.
Okay, so, the department...
they're sponsoring a competition to shoot a new recruitment video.
You know, help educate the public about what we do, ways they can help, maybe join up.
Anyway, so I was hoping to throw something together with the guys, but if now is not the right time...
No, no.
It's a good idea.
Keep people busy.
Great.
Great.
I...
I took this filmmakers' workshop in high school, got some great ideas.
Hey, maybe you would be interested in a role?
- No way in hell.
- Sure.
Sure.
No problem.
Thanks for the support.
You're welcome.
Who wants to be a star?
I...
God.
Don't ask.
Well, now I have to.
Promises I'll learn chess in a week, but I still can't tell a knight from a... whatever that is.
You know, if you're that bored, there is a sink full of dishes that aren't gonna wash themselves.
No.
I just have a friend who's really into it, and I'm trying to find some common ground.
A friend?
Antonio's son, Diego.
The last time we hung out, he barely said two words to me.
Had his head buried in some chess app the whole time.
Figure if I learn about something he's into, maybe he'll...
Hey, Otis, you got time for a quick chess lesson?
Um, have a plan, control the middle, protect your king.
- Helpful.
- I am no expert, but I do know a few basic strategies.
- You do?
- White goes first, and I recommend putting this pawn here.
You're a lifesaver.
If you tell Squad I know chess, I'll deny it.
Noted.
You look pretty good, considering you jumped out a window.
How do you feel?
Like I... jumped out a window.
What is it?
- What is what?
- You missed the course in med school in lying to your patients.
What is it?
Well, the good news is you're gonna make a full recovery.
Bad news?
The bruising in your pelvis.
It's enough of a problem that you can't be cleared for bone marrow donation.
For how long?
Your body suffered a trauma.
Look, I talked to everyone, and the hospital won't allow the procedure.
- For how long?
- Too long.
Once Anna finishes chemo, she needs the infusion within a few days.
You won't be ready in time.
Look, man, we're not giving up.
We're gonna redouble our efforts to find a match.
You were out there.
Bound to be another.
In the meantime, you just focus on your recovery, okay?
I'll check on you in a little bit.
Here, buddy.
What is it?
What if Andre doesn't come back from Afghanistan?
What if we're the reason he never meets Louie?
Can we be the ones to make that call for him?
- Boom.
- What's that?
Nothing.
It's a...
GoPro HERO5, the premier tool for skateboarding auteurs everywhere.
I don't think Connie's gonna reimburse us for that.
No.
My cousin lent me this.
It's ours the rest of the week.
Yeah?
You got a plan?
Yeah.
Why fake the drama when we see the real deal every day?
Cinéma vérité.
I like it.
No.
I'm talking about realism.
I think that's what that means.
Okay, then yeah, that.
We take this along on our calls, right?
We catch some real fires, some explosions, some aerial rescues.
The type of stuff that we do all the time.
You know what?
You're right.
Who needs some phony razzle-dazzle?
We walk into burning buildings for a living.
Let's show them what we got.
Yeah.
Neuro consult, bed 5.
Neuro consult, bed 5.
I can see you.
You know, whoever's out there,
I've got a call button, and I'm not afraid to use it.
I thought you were all laid up.
Well...
I'm sore, but I'm fine.
How you doing?
You know, just fighting cancer drop by drop.
Clarke told me everything, so if you're here to talk about your feelings, can you please take it someplace else?
I'm not much of a "talk about my feelings" kind of guy.
Well, I knew I liked you.
- But I just wanted...
- Don't, please!
Come on.
I'm sorry that it didn't work out.
I really wanted to help.
I know.
You know, they're still looking for another match, so, I mean, you never know.
How long did it take you to find me?
It's like... 14 months.
But, hey, maybe my story here's over.
Whatever higher power's pushing the buttons has a plan, and I'm really at peace with that.
I should've taken the shift off.
No, no, don't do that.
Come here.
What happened to that girl from the fire?
She made it, right?
Yeah.
There you go.
You're off the hook.
You've already saved a life this week.
Hey!
There he is.
Hey!
Maybe don't go missing from your hospital room.
Let's not do that.
Empty bed sends the wrong signals.
I'm fine.
Hey, buddy.
Only you can jump out of a window and live to tell about it.
Nine lives.
You all right?
What is it?
Clarke says they won't go through with the donation.
They say there's been too much trauma.
But she's... she started the chemo.
Yeah.
It's not supposed to happen this way.
Sorry, Kelly.
Anna thinks it's all part of some higher plan.
I don't know, but there's no way they're gonna give you the epidural with your injuries, so I think acceptance is probably the best gift you can giver her.
What?
She needs to know she's got your full support.
No, no, no.
The epidural.
Trauma to the spine prevents you from receiving the epidural.
I'm pretty sure that's why they called the procedure off.
So, this is about how much it's gonna hurt?
Well, pain, liability, safety, a bunch of other terms I'm sure the lawyers have at the ready.
I'm not gonna let someone else make that call.
It's not gonna happen.
Well, good morning.
It's rare someone gets to my office earlier than me.
Sorry.
It's about Anna Daley.
Trust me.
I understand your frustration.
These transfusion cases are always a rollercoaster, and they often don't end well.
I want to go through with the donation, without the anesthesia if need be.
Lieutenant, without that epidural, the procedure would be intolerable.
I go into fires that are 1,100 degrees wearing 45 pounds of turnout gear.
I can tolerate a lot.
Yes.
I'm sure.
But this isn't a conversation.
Your doctors won't allow it, and I can't allow it.
If I don't do this, she'll die.
I won't let that happen.
Lieutenant, you don't have a choice.
Are we gonna have pizza?
Yeah, we sure are, buddy.
Double pepperoni.
Hey, Louie, some of our friends wanted to have lunch with us.
You think you can share your pizza with them?
Okay.
Don't be nervous, okay?
It's good to make new friends.
Here you go.
Hold my hand.
Hey.
Gabby.
Matt.
These are my parents.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, there.
Hey!
Hey, Louie.
I'm Andre.
How you doing, buddy?
Want to sit down?
You want to take a seat?
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go order.
Okay.
- Come on.
- Sit him down over here.
All right.
- Okay, there we go.
- Okay.
Hey, what's up, man?
Gabby, right?
I'm Mary.
Nice to meet you.
What you're doing is very brave.
Course.
Can't believe it.
He looks just like Andre did when he was his age.
We only found out a few days ago.
It's a lot to take in.
Thank you for keeping him safe, making him so happy.
Yeah, got it.
Same as every other place.
Thank you.
You too.
So, you can stop with the calls.
I will be the first call other hospital administrators will make.
Yeah, I figured that.
And when you're cursing in pain, you have Clarke here to thank for that.
We've convinced your doctors to let you do the donation.
Now, a tree had to lose its life for all of the papers you have to sign, but if you're up for it, so are we.
Can't take the fight out of a soldier.
You sure?
- What is that?
- This is butternut squash and Brussels sprouts hash.
"The Dude Diet"?
You trying to trick us into eating healthy?
I'll stick with the corned beef in my hash.
Just quit your whining and try it.
Hey, not bad.
Hey, Spielberg, how's your masterpiece coming?
Well, that's the thing about the calls recently is that they haven't been exactly riveting.
Come on, man.
That gas leak was pretty exciting.
Funny thing about gas leaks... you can't see them.
All right, so, what about that kitchen fire we had down on Division?
The old lady that left her hot plate on?
The guy who got tased this morning?
You got that, right?
Down on the ground.
I said, down on the ground.
Now!
Stop... no, stop right there!
Taser, Taser, Taser.
Yeah, we're screwed.
Yep.
Sharon Goodwin from Med.
Kelly Severide has been given the go-ahead for his bone marrow donation.
Wait.
What about the anesthesia?
'Cause Dawson said he wasn't cleared for that.
Um, there isn't gonna be any anesthesia.
So, they're going to drill into his hip and just take it out?
That's right.
About a liter of it.
That's a tough bastard.
So, please send your prayers his way.
Hey, I bet Boden wouldn't mind if you took a few hours off, go see Kelly.
Yeah, and then it would be about two minutes before he kicked me out.
Stella, don't let his lone wolf act fool you.
He'd be happy to see you.
Hey.
What's up?
Andre.
Can I speak to you for a minute?
Yeah.
What is it?
It's just... these last couple days, and then meeting Louie, it's got me spinning, you know?
I haven't been able to stop thinking about him.
It's like my whole life changed overnight.
What are you trying to say?
I know what I said before, but a son needs his father, and I need him.
Look, I spoke to my superior officer about a new post close to home, down at Rock Island.
And he's supportive of it.
And I want to do everything in my power to make it happen.
I want to fight for full custody of my son.
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to hurt you folks.
That's not what this is about.
I promise.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
- I'm sorry.
- I really am.
- Truck 81.
- Gabby.
- Single-car accident.
Edgebrook Woods.
North Branch Trail Extension.
Get out of here!
Go!
Hey!
I'm Sylvie.
We're here to help you.
- Are you guys okay?
- We're cold.
Hey, we need blankets and heat pads.
Can you tell us what you're doing out here?
Dad said to wait here for help.
Your dad was here?
Where'd he go?
He went back for Lizzie.
Dawson, call another ambulance.
- Truck, with me.
- All right, guys...
Main, this is Ambo 61 requesting a second ambulance at this location.
Fire department!
Call out!
Hey!
There's the car!
Move!
Sir!
Sir, are you okay?
My daughter, you have to help her.
Hey.
Hey!
I'm a firefighter.
Okay.
I'm Matt.
What's your name?
Lizzie.
We're gonna get you out of there, quick as I can.
We need the Hurst, Sawzall, Paratech struts, wedges, and a C-collar.
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy.
Check out his leg.
- Yeah.
- Okay, now breathe.
There you go.
There you go.
Dawson, we need you and another backboard here now.
Father got a compound fracture and he's lost a lot of blood.
- Possible hypothermia.
- Okay.
Okay, let me take a look.
Yeah.
I could only get reception up on the road.
You walked back and forth on this leg?
I had to get them out.
Okay, peel it back.
Hey, do you feel okay?
Gonna get you out.
Got you.
- Daddy!
- Lizzie!
They got her.
Don't worry.
- Are you okay?
- She's gonna be fine.
Hi, baby.
Chief, second ambulance is here.
Copy that.
We'll put the father in the 61.
We'll send the kids separately.
No, please!
I have to go with him!
I have to be with my dad.
He would never leave me.
It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay, honey.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay, yeah, you can come with us.
Come on.
Okay.
Three, two, one.
Come on, kiddo.
BP 130 over 80.
Heartrate 93.
All right, they're done with the local.
Last chance to back out, bud.
No.
I'm good.
Okay, make the stab incision.
Oxygen's good.
Syringe.
Needle's in.
Now insert the Jamshidi and twist to the right.
All right, here's the fun part, buddy.
132 over 80.
Hang in there, bud.
Prep the gauze.
Okay, listen up.
Severide is out of surgery.
By all accounts, it went well, but he's in for a bad couple of days.
- Thank you, Chief.
- Thanks, Chief.
- Copy, Chief.
- Yup.
Hey, I was gonna tell you the chess thing worked perfectly.
- Yeah?
- I had an actual conversation with Diego, eye contact and everything.
That's great.
Did you beat him?
Are you kidding me?
I got creamed.
Anyway, thank you.
Herrmann, can you take over?
I got your message.
That guy is out of his mind.
Let's talk somewhere in private.
Come on in.
Custody battles are never pretty.
I'm telling you now there will be a time when you look back and think this was one of the easy parts.
Great.
Now, you told me Mr. Keyes didn't show up to the initial meeting that you and DCFS arranged between him and Louie, correct?
- Yes.
- Correct.
Good, because we are going to use that incident to paint him as an unreliable and unstable parent, someone who can't be counted on to show up, day in, day out.
Well, he... he just had learned of his deployment.
We control the "whys," Gabby, and we'll frame the facts however we want.
I have a private investigator I want to use to dig into him.
His family, too.
Get us anything from his past that can help bolster our version of this guy.
The longer this drags on, the better for us.
I think we'd prefer not put Louie through this for too long.
Guys, trust me.
This is a good strategy.
It all begins with the hearing tomorrow.
That's when we start making our case.
We are going to fight this, tooth and nail, okay?
Try not to move.
The Dilaudid's probably wearing off, so just push the button when you need more pain meds.
Strongest stuff we can give you, man, I'm sorry.
Here.
Just breathe.
We finished our interview with Mr. Keyes.
We'd like to see all of you together.
Um, yeah, I'm sure you weren't expecting all these people.
No, we weren't.
Right.
Well, I wanted you to see Louie's family.
This is my older sister, Leah, and her crew.
They live over on Lakeview.
And my sister Tracy and her family.
They live down the block from my parents.
My Uncle Charles wanted to come too, but I thought that might be overkill.
Andre.
Look, I...
I've seen you with him.
How much you love him.
But I swear to you...
I will love this boy...
More than life itself.
Everyone here will.
Just one second.
What are we doing, Matt?
I'm not sure anymore.
I love him so much.
I know.
Me too.
But this isn't about us.
I can't do it.
I can't.
I can't fight for a year.
For what?
And what kind of people would we be to deny Louie all of this?
I'm telling you, a healthy Duncan Keith makes all the difference on that back line.
All this and a Hawks fan, too?
How are you feeling?
Been better.
No offense... it's kind of nice not being the sickest person in the room.
For once, I'm not here for you.
It is time to prep you for the transplant.
My God.
Wow.
You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear you say that.
Kelly...
Thank you so much.
I'll take really good care of your bone marrow.
I promise.
See you on the other side.
Throbbing, dizzy, can't eat?
You don't have to pretend for me, man.
Might hurt a little.
What you did for Anna... it's the bravest thing I ever saw.
Can I take my monkey with me?
Of course you can.
Here.
You can take everything with you.
Your new room... it's so big and sunny.
And all your toys can fit in there.
You remember when you first came to live with us?
How brave and strong you were?
And everything turned out okay, didn't it?
Well, I think...
That if you're really brave and strong today, that this new home... everything's gonna turn out even better.
Okay?
And we're not going anywhere.
I will always be here for you...
Any time you want for the rest of your life.
I love you.
I will always love you.
You hear me?
Okay.
All right, you got to keep packing, okay?
Put your boots in the suitcase.
I know it hurts.
But they love him.
He's gonna be so happy.
We were there when he needed us.
No one can ever take that away.
It's today, yeah?
Louie's dad is picking him up at their place.
I cannot imagine what they're going through.
So, you missed all of it?
Ripping the roof off that car?
The hero dad?
Everything?
Yep.
And tonight's the deadline?
It was a good idea, Otis.
Okay, I'm gonna say something now.
Our family are not all here.
I get that.
And several of them are hurt.
They may be suffering, but they are not weak.
They are among the strongest men and women that I know.
That is what it is to be one of us, to be a firefighter, to be able to change the fate of the people that we meet.
That means when we turn up at a call, we don't see strangers.
We see mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.
It means that when we see others running out of that fire, we run in.
The job we've taken on is to make a difference.
What some in this house have done this week... sacrificing their own health, their own happiness for that of another, that is the true meaning of what we do.
Hey.
Thanks.
I got it.
Okay.
Hey, buddy.
We'll see you soon?
Hey.
You be a good boy, okay?
Hey, buddy.
What's up?
Ready to go?
Here, I'll take the monkey, okay?
All right.
Come on, son.

Title: "Orangins"
Titans, prepare yourselves...
It's story time!
Story time!
I love stories.
Yo, tell that ones about the three billy goats.
I loves that part where they wreck that troll.
I wish to hear the tale of the tiny fairy princess who rides a cat as though it were a horse.
Meow!
Meow!
I have an even better story to tell.
It's an origin story.
Oh, snap, I love orangins.
So juicy and filled with that vitamin C's.
Not exactly, but this is indeed a juicy, pulpy tale.
It begins many years ago, on a night like any other.
At that time I was a young circus acrobat,
- part of the famous...
- Hold up!
Did you say "circus?"
Ah, he is again telling the depressing tale of his childhood.
It's not a depressing tale, it's my origin story!
Nah, we want to hear about fruit, bro.
Come on, I didn't even get to the good part yet.
There are no good parts.
All of the parts are the sad.
That's what makes origin story so great.
The heart-wrenching tragedy.
If you want a tragic origin story, you should hear mine.
Oh, yeah, tells it, mama.
I loves this one.
No!
I'm in the middle of telling my poignant origin story.
All right, it starts way back when I just a normal kid living with some old people.
Oh, no, I need to get to the science lab.
I got to go, old people raising me.
Before you go, remember, if you ever get superpowers you should probably use it to do some good instead of not doing some good.
Quiet, old man,
- you don't know anything about my life.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- (ZAPS) - (CAMERA CLICKS)
I don't know why they hired a teenage photographer to take pictures of all these secret lab experiments,
- but I sure am grateful for the work.
- (SQUAWKING)
(GROANS) Oh, man, that dang raven just bit me!
I hope it wasn't one of those radioactive ones.
(ZAPS)
Oh, great, now I'm gonna get radiation poisoning and...
Oh, wait...
I'm feeling stronger.
What?
Awesome!
I got superpowers from that radioactive bird bite.
- (SWISHES) - (GRUNTS)
Ah!
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) It's pretty funny.
(MUNCHING)
- (BANGS) - (SQUAWKS)
(LAUGHING)
(INDISTINCT CRIES)
- Let us out.
- Oh, my goodness, help!
Those people look like they could use my help.
But I'm too busy having fun with my superpowers.
Before you go, remember, if you ever get superpowers, you should probably use it to do some good instead of not doing some good.
Mmm, maybe the old man raising me with his old wife was right.

STARFIRE:
So I saved a bunch of people with my sweet new superpowers and thought to myself,
"Hey, I should do this more often."
Radioactive bird bite!
- Classic.
- Yeah, it was pretty cool.
Oh, an old man passed away at the age of 95 from natural causes.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
- (ALL CRYING)
- He died too young.
- (SOBS)
- Wow!
That story is not true and it is not tragic!
You want some real tragedy, bro?
Cyborg, tell this fool your origin story
- and don't leave nothing out.
- You got it, bro.
It all started back in the day.
I was born on this doomed alien planet that was about to blow up at any minute.
To save me, my loving but questionable alien parents... -(COOING) placed me in some old raggedy capsule and shot me into outer space like some sha-wow!
-(CRYING)
I was just a helpless baby boy slipping through space all by my lonesome.
It was crazy.
I don't know what they were thinking.
Then boom, I crash landed on some random farm here on Earth.
This nice old farm couple found me all naked and crying, so they decided to take me in and raise me as their own.
Later I discovered I had all types of cool powers. -(ZAPS)
So I left that farm life and became a superhero instead.
- Saving people falling off things...
- (SCREAMS) like tall buildings, waterfalls, ladders, horses and chairs.
And that's how I ended up here on Earth all super like.
- Ooh!
- Wow!
Oh, and that nice old farm couple that raised me later fell on hard times with the climate change, agricultural subsidies and the advent of industrial farming.
They lost their farm and are now homeless.
- That is really tragic.
- (BOTH WAILING)
(GROWLS)
That was even more ridiculous than the last one.
You guys are making a mockery of these sacred and tragic tales.
- We would never.
- Yes, you would.
This is serious stuff and you should take it seriously.
Robin, is correct.
There and a for I shall recount the true tale of my origin.
Dark and tragic though it is.
My kitties and I had just seen the wondrous moving picture.
Oh, what a wondrous moving picture!
I did not think the hot shot fighter pilots would ever be the friends,
- but I was the incorrect.
- (MEOWING)
Oh, you wish to take the shortcut home?
(MEOWING)
Through the dark and the grimy ally?
- (MEOWING)
- Very well!
♪ Ha, la, la, la
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la
- (GASPS) - (GROWLS)
- (BARKS) - (ALL SCREAM)
Kitties?
(YELLING) Kitties!
I vowed to bring the mean puppies of the city to justice.
Using my departed kitties' vast fortune I built the Crime Fighting Cave and The Very Nice Computer.
- (KITTY ALFRED MEOWS)
- Thank you, Kitty Alfred.
(MEOWING)
(ALARM BLARING)
- (CUP SHATTERS)
- The kitty alarm!
(BARKS, LAUGHS)
The Joking Dog...
Leave it to me.
(SWISHES)
This city belongs to me, Joking Dog.
- (BARKING)
- Down, down, down.
- No.
No, boy, no.
Stay.
- (WATER SPRAY HISSES)
- (WHIMPERS)
- And so I became the protector of the good kitties of the city.
A guardian that is quiet.
A knight with the lights off.
And that is the end.
Oh, except Doggy Bane once cracked my spine and I was unable to walk for some time.
(STARFIRE SCREAMS)
(BOTH CRYING)
It's all so plausibly tragic.
(GRUNTS)
That is Batman's origin story with you as Batman and everyone else as cats and dogs.
I thought Batman was bitten by a radioactive bat
- or something.
- Oh, no, no, no, that was me.
Remember, with the bird?
Batman came from a planet of bats, but the Earth's yellow sun gives him extra man powers.
Huh, I thought's my dude got hit with that bat gamma radiation so he gets all them muskels.
He wasn't...
You can't...
You can't just make up... (SCOFFS) Forget it.
You know, I thought sharing our origin stories would help us reflect on the awesome responsibility we have as heroes, but I guess not.
All right, dude, you wants the real story?
I'm gonna tell you the real story, for real.
Thank you, Beast Boy.
Buckles up your butts, y'all, 'cause this is my origins.
(SWISHES)
Back in the day I was a test pilot, flying all kinds of crazy experimental fighter jets.
(ALARM BLARING)
They call me The Man Without Fear, yo.
- 'Cause I wasn't afraid of nothing!
- (BEEPS)
(SHOUTING) I ain't afraid of nothing!
One night I was on the beach just chillin', thinking about how rad and fearless I is and such things,
- when I saw something in the sky.
- (THUDS)
Whoa, gnarly!
(DOOR HISSES)
I have searched the galaxy for you, Man Without Fear.
Take this ring.
Use it for good!
(GASPS)
(ZAPPING)
That's what's up...
Fresh.
So basically I gots this sick ring from an alien and then I did things like protect the universe from red dudes and other guys.
And that is the tale of how I became the superhero.
- Oh!
Are you kidding me?
- Wow!
Great story, really.
I never knew you were a pilot.
That's because he wasn't.
He just told you Green Lantern's origin story.
Oh, yeah, duh!
Why do you think I'm green, fool?
I don't know, something to do with a rare monkey carrying an incurable disease, an experimental serum.
(LAUGHS) Oh, bro!
Now yous the one being ridiculous.
Serums in monkeys.
(CHUCKLES) Get out of here.
Wow!
So you're green 'cause you've been a Green Lantern all this time.
Nah, bro, nah.
I'm just a fake green dude coming out of Green Lantern's Green Lantern ring.
(CHUCKLES) Check it.
Oh, what,
I'm not even real!
- (ALL CRYING)
- Oh, what a tragedy.
My best friend's a hologram.

Back in the day I was a test pilot, flying all kinds of crazy experimental fighter jets.
They call me The Man Without Fear, yo.
'Cause I wasn't afraid of nothing!
I ain't afraid of nothing!
One night I was on the beach just chillin', thinking about how rad and fearless I is and such things, when I saw something in the sky.
Whoa, gnarly!
I have searched the galaxy for you, Man Without Fear.
Take this ring.
Use it for good!
That's what's up...
Fresh.
So basically I gots this sick ring from an alien and then I did things like protect the universe from red dudes and other guys.
And that is the tale of how I became the superhero.
- Oh!
Are you kidding me?
- Wow!
Great story, really.
I never knew you were a pilot.
That's because he wasn't.
He just told you Green Lantern's origin story.
Oh, yeah, duh!
Why do you think I'm green, fool?
I don't know, something to do with a rare monkey carrying an incurable disease, an experimental serum.
Oh, bro!
Now yous the one being ridiculous.
Serums in monkeys.
Get out of here.
Wow!
So you're green 'cause you've been a Green Lantern all this time.
Nah, bro, nah.
I'm just a fake green dude coming out of Green Lantern's Green Lantern ring.
Check it.
Oh, what,
I'm not even real!
Oh, what a tragedy.
My best friend's a hologram.
My best friend's a hologram.
Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.
Nicely done, Howard.
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.
Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.
Those are just the things I say out loud.
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.
- What's wrong?
- I'm looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.
That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.
We're good to go.
Yeah.
It doesn't need to be smaller.
Shame on you.
Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?
I'll tell you.
We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup.
Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that's just poodle politics.
Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Fine.
Candy bars.
Now, do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.
Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.
Your work is done.
Go home.
I don't want to go home.
Fine, go for a little walk.
Then what?
Just keep walking.

At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
I know.
That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.
You're kidding.
I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.
You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.
I've been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now's the time.
W-We can just lock the door;
you don't have to kill him.
You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.
Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.
As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.
Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.
Really?
Yeah.
Go ahead, open it.
"Congratulations.
"The bearer of this certificate is entitled
"to the ultimate train experience
"at The Nevada Northern Railway.
"You are at the throttle.
"You are the engineer.
You are running the locomotive."
This doesn't happen very often, but here comes a hug.
Oh, dear!
I have to tinkle again!
Okay.
Where were we?
For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?
Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?
I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list.
I warned you, a lot of people apply
- when they're still pregnant.
- Well, I didn't.
I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.
Whoa.
Just trying to help.
Sorry.
Howie's back at work and there's just so much going on.
Is there anything we can do?
Sure.
Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there's a mountain of dirty laundry.
Wash it or burn in, your choice.
(Halley crying over monitor) Ugh, be right back.
No, no.
I will take care of it.
Oh, thank you.
While I'm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.
All right, you know what you need?
A night away from all of this.
You know, where you can just kind of relax and... (Halley continues crying over monitor)
I'm just gonna... turn this off.
(Halley continues crying nearby)
Much better. (clears throat)
Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break.
We could go dancing.
That sounds really nice.
AMY:
Oh.
All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.
Okay, that's the one to beat.
Good luck.
People have been saying that for 600 years.
Hey, you're home early.
You'll never believe it.
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.
Wow.
He finally used it.
What'd you do?
No idea.
All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Well, I'm really happy for you.
Oh, no.
It's not just me.
No.
The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.
I give up.
You!
No.
I really give up.
Oh, oh.
And guess where we get to sleep?
Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose.
Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.
On the first day,
I get to drive a steam engine.
Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.
Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they'll let me stay as long as I want.
So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.
Can I pee now?
Oh, get this!
I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.
I get to learn things like hand signals.
Ooh.
There's forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes.
Are you done yet?
You're missing some great stuff out here.
Oh, this is good.
There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for.
But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.
I'll be blowing the whistle.
Amy, get up.
It's time to go to work.
(groans)
This train thing worked out better than I thought.
He's home studying the engineer's manual.
(sighs)
It's so peaceful without him here.
Can I ask you how much that cost?
$4,000-- worth every penny.
(knock on door)
Gentlemen.
Colonel Williams.
Sir.
Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.
Great.
We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
(chuckles)
Don't do that.
What's this?
Oh, nothing.
Just some math we don't need.
This is a different approach.
Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?
It's just a theory.
Uh, it's not even worked out.
Oh. (chuckles)
I want this.
But we've already met the agreed upon specs.
Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.
Sir, uh, I-If I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.
It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.
Yeah, I want this.
But that's just a theory.
It's not even a complete thought.
You both make excellent points.
And thank you for presenting it so articulately.
(chuckles) Make this.
(door closes)
The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
All right.
You guys ready to get crazy?
Well, the bra under here ain't beige.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Okay.
You ladies have fun tonight.
Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.
Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
My apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.
Like I said, you ladies have fun.
We will.
Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump.
Let's party.
You know, if you pump at the bar,
I promise we'll get free drinks.
Call if there's any problems.
No.
She's busy.
You call Howard.
Got it.
Call me.
Don't call Howard.
I would never call Howard.
Okay, instead of arguing all night, let's just split up the baby chores.
Yeah, great.
Um, I'll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.
I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Oh, boo-hoo.
I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon.
(electrical crackling)
What is that?
I don't know, but if he yells,
"It's alive," we run.
Oh, hey.
If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.
I'm welding this locomotive engine.
And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?
How'd you even get that up the stairs?
I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."
And then I couldn't, so...
I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.
Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.
Interesting.
Well, so I was right.
Open a window.
It's about to get smug in here.
Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine,
I don't think I can go back to theory.
I'm an engineer now.
And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer.
Not that goofy kind you are.
Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.
Just help us out.
Sorry.
I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.
(laughs)
He's worried about looking foolish.
That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.
Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.
Why are you doing this?
Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish;
so much is unprovable.
But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked.
Then it clacked.
Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.
(imitates train whistle):
Whoo-whoo!
Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?
Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.
Okay, stop that!
No more preschool talk.
Tonight is about having fun.
Nothing says fun like being scolded.
(ringtone playing)
It's Raj.
Everything okay?
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
Hang up!
We don't need help.
I don't need your help deciding when we need help!
Raj, what's going on?
Yes, so,
I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."
It says "Tuesday."
How is that a "T"?
!
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.
Okay, yes,
I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
You're wasting perfectly good milk.
Fine, you drink it.
It's just milk.
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!
Okay, give--
Can you guys handle this or not?
Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time.
(chuckles)
She said I was in charge.
Hmm.
So we just throw this away?
What else are you gonna do with it?
Put it in your coffee?
Well, I don't take it black.
Okay.
This is everything he had on the board.
I'm sure we can figure the rest out.
All right.
(clears throat)
Hmm.
Feel free to jump in.
"Hmm" is all I got.
Oh, we can get this.
Is there any chance it's upside-down?
Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
It's classified.
If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.
Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."
You haven't pitched anything.
Just keep thinking.
I got it.
You really figured it out?
No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.
Oh, you're a genius.
Yeah, I know.
That's not even a math symbol.
That's just Charlie Brown's hair.
Sorry, guys.
This club was so great.
How could they turn it into a bookstore?
I thought we got rid of all those.
Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?
(ringtone playing)
Hello?
(Halley crying) Nothing to worry about.
She's just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.
She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!
She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!
You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?
(whispers):
Wait.
She's settling down.
(Halley quiets)
Oh, okay, false alarm.
Little parenting tip:
sleeping babies hate flash photography.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Hey, there's another dance club nearby.
I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they're open.
Maybe we should just call it a night.
You sure?
They're open till dos.
Yeah, we're all dressed up.
Why go home?
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.
What's going on with you?
I don't know.
This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
I'm not sad.
I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
I'm not sad.
I mean, hello.
Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.
What are you sad about?
Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
You're upset I had a baby?
No, of course not.
I just...
I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.
What feelings?
Pressure!
I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401(k).
Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.
You think that stuff is fun?
Being a parent is terrifying.
I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.
I get that, okay?
It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.
AMY:
Come on.
You've got so much to feel good about.
You've got a great job now.
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.
You make more than I do.
You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.
It's bigger than mine.
And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
I'm not even engaged once.
I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.
I'm not getting any younger.
Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of...
Careful.
The sound of crying can make me lactate.
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
(crying)
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.
(crying)
And there they go.
Ew.
Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.
That's right.
We figured it out all by ourselves.
Wasn't even that hard.
No.
Well, good for you guys.
Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.
Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
No, thanks.
I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.
It's a manifold.
Oh.
Well, I guess it's fixed.
Just look at the board.
That's wrong.
Oh, no!
What should we have done differently?
Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.
Told ya. (scoffs)
Can you fix it for us?
(sighs)
Okay, but this is the last time.
Nice try, blockheads.
Come on, Sheldon.
You can't turn your back on physics.
Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.
But if you really want to learn the mechanical side,
I can teach you anything you want to know.
LEONARD:
And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.
And with all these new skills, you'd be able to fix any model train.
You'd be the king of the train store!
Excuse me.
I have a girlfriend.
I'm already king of the train store.
So, what do you say?
Oh, what choice do I have?
You need me.
I'm like the crankshaft of this team.
That's a turbo.
Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.
I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.
(train chugging, steam hissing)
(train whistle blows)
I apologize that it's so warm in here.
It is warm in here.
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.
Me, too.
May I borrow your water?

I can get us there in two.

Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?
Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.
Okay, stop that!
No more preschool talk.
Tonight is about having fun.
Nothing says fun like being scolded.
(ringtone playing)
It's Raj.
Everything okay?
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
Hang up!
We don't need help.
I don't need your help deciding when we need help!
Raj, what's going on?
Yes, so,
I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."
It says "Tuesday."
How is that a "T"?
!
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.
Okay, yes,
I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
You're wasting perfectly good milk.
Fine, you drink it.
It's just milk.
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!
Okay, give--
Can you guys handle this or not?
Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time.
(chuckles)
She said I was in charge.
Hmm.
So we just throw this away?
What else are you gonna do with it?
Put it in your coffee?
Well, I don't take it black.
Okay.
This is everything he had on the board.
I'm sure we can figure the rest out.
All right.
(clears throat)
Hmm.
Feel free to jump in.
"Hmm" is all I got.
Oh, we can get this.
Is there any chance it's upside-down?
Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
It's classified.
If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.
Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."
You haven't pitched anything.
Just keep thinking.
I got it.
You really figured it out?
No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.
Oh, you're a genius.
Yeah, I know.
That's not even a math symbol.
That's just Charlie Brown's hair.
Sorry, guys.
This club was so great.
How could they turn it into a bookstore?
I thought we got rid of all those.
Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?
(ringtone playing)
Hello?
(Halley crying) Nothing to worry about.
She's just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.
She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!
She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!
You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?
(whispers):
Wait.
She's settling down.
(Halley quiets)
Oh, okay, false alarm.
Little parenting tip:
sleeping babies hate flash photography.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Hey, there's another dance club nearby.
I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they're open.
Maybe we should just call it a night.
You sure?
They're open till dos.
Yeah, we're all dressed up.
Why go home?
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.
What's going on with you?
I don't know.
This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
I'm not sad.
I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
I'm not sad.
I mean, hello.
Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.
What are you sad about?
Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
You're upset I had a baby?
No, of course not.
I just...
I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.
What feelings?
Pressure!
I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401(k).
Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.
You think that stuff is fun?
Being a parent is terrifying.
I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.
I get that, okay?
It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.
AMY:
Come on.
You've got so much to feel good about.
You've got a great job now.
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.
You make more than I do.
You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.
It's bigger than mine.
And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
I'm not even engaged once.
I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.
I'm not getting any younger.
Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of...
Careful.
The sound of crying can make me lactate.
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
(crying)
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.
(crying)
And there they go.
Ew.
Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.
That's right.
We figured it out all by ourselves.
Wasn't even that hard.
No.
Well, good for you guys.
Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.
Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
No, thanks.
I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.
It's a manifold.
Oh.
Well, I guess it's fixed.
Just look at the board.
That's wrong.
Oh, no!
What should we have done differently?
Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.
Told ya. (scoffs)
Can you fix it for us?
(sighs)
Okay, but this is the last time.
Nice try, blockheads.
Come on, Sheldon.
You can't turn your back on physics.
Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.
But if you really want to learn the mechanical side,
I can teach you anything you want to know.
LEONARD:
And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.
And with all these new skills, you'd be able to fix any model train.
You'd be the king of the train store!
Excuse me.
I have a girlfriend.
I'm already king of the train store.
So, what do you say?
Oh, what choice do I have?
You need me.
I'm like the crankshaft of this team.
That's a turbo.
Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.
I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.
(train chugging, steam hissing)
(train whistle blows)
I apologize that it's so warm in here.
It is warm in here.
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.
Me, too.
May I borrow your water?

Sorry.

I can get us there in two.

Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.
Nicely done, Howard.
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.
Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.
Those are just the things I say out loud.
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.
What's wrong?
I'm looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.
That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.
We're good to go.
Yeah.
It doesn't need to be smaller.
Shame on you.
Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?
I'll tell you.
We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup.
Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that's just poodle politics.
Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Fine.
Candy bars.
Now, do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.
Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.
Your work is done.
Go home.
I don't want to go home.
Fine, go for a little walk.
Then what?
Just keep walking.

At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
I know.
That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.
You're kidding.
I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.
You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.
I've been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now's the time.
W-We can just lock the door;
you don't have to kill him.
You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.
Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.
As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.
Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.
Really?
Yeah.
Go ahead, open it.
"Congratulations.
"The bearer of this certificate is entitled
"to the ultimate train experience
"at The Nevada Northern Railway.
"You are at the throttle.
"You are the engineer.
You are running the locomotive."
This doesn't happen very often, but here comes a hug.
Oh, dear!
I have to tinkle again!
Okay.
Where were we?
For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?
Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?
I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list.
I warned you, a lot of people apply when they're still pregnant.
Well, I didn't.
I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.
Whoa.
Just trying to help.
Sorry.
Howie's back at work and there's just so much going on.
Is there anything we can do?
Sure.
Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there's a mountain of dirty laundry.
Wash it or burn in, your choice.
Ugh, be right back.
No, no.
I will take care of it.
Oh, thank you.
While I'm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.
All right, you know what you need?
A night away from all of this.
You know, where you can just kind of relax and...
I'm just gonna... turn this off.
Much better.
Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break.
We could go dancing.
- That sounds really nice.
- Oh.
All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.
Okay, that's the one to beat.
Good luck.
People have been saying that for 600 years.
Hey, you're home early.
You'll never believe it.
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.
Wow.
He finally used it.
What'd you do?
No idea.
All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Well, I'm really happy for you.
Oh, no.
It's not just me.
No.
The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.
I give up.
You!
No.
I really give up.
Oh, oh.
And guess where we get to sleep?
Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose.
Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.
On the first day,
I get to drive a steam engine.
Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.
Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they'll let me stay as long as I want.
So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.
Can I pee now?
Oh, get this!
I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.
I get to learn things like hand signals.
Ooh.
There's forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes.
Are you done yet?
You're missing some great stuff out here.
Oh, this is good.
There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for.
But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.
I'll be blowing the whistle.
Amy, get up.
It's time to go to work.
This train thing worked out better than I thought.
He's home studying the engineer's manual.
It's so peaceful without him here.
Can I ask you how much that cost?
$4,000-- worth every penny.
Gentlemen.
Colonel Williams.
Sir.
Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.
Great.
We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
Don't do that.
What's this?
Oh, nothing.
Just some math we don't need.
This is a different approach.
Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?
It's just a theory.
Uh, it's not even worked out.
Oh.
I want this.
But we've already met the agreed upon specs.
Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.
Sir, uh, i-if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.
It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.
Yeah, I want this.
But that's just a theory.
It's not even a complete thought.
You both make excellent points.
And thank you for presenting it so articulately.
Make this.
The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
All right.
You guys ready to get crazy?
Well, the bra under here ain't beige.
Okay.
You ladies have fun tonight.
Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.
Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
My apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.
Like I said, you ladies have fun.
We will.
Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump.
Let's party.
You know, if you pump at the bar,
I promise we'll get free drinks.
Call if there's any problems.
No.
She's busy.
You call Howard.
Got it.
Call me.
Don't call Howard.
I would never call Howard.
Okay, instead of arguing all night, let's just split up the baby chores.
Yeah, great.
Um, I'll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.
I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Oh, boo-hoo.
I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon.
What is that?
I don't know, but if he yells,
"It's alive," we run.
Oh, hey.
If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.
I'm welding this locomotive engine.
And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?
How'd you even get that up the stairs?
I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."
And then I couldn't, so...
I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.
Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.
Interesting.
Well, so I was right.
Open a window.
It's about to get smug in here.
Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine,
I don't think I can go back to theory.
I'm an engineer now.
And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer.
Not that goofy kind you are.
Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.
Just help us out.
Sorry.
I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.
He's worried about looking foolish.
That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.
Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.
Why are you doing this?
Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish;
so much is unprovable.
But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked.
Then it clacked.
Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.
Whoo-whoo!
Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?
Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.
Okay, stop that!

Yes, so,
I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."
It says "Tuesday."
How is that a "T"?
!
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.
Okay, yes,
I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
You're wasting perfectly good milk.

It's just milk.

Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose.
Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.
On the first day,
I get to drive a steam engine.
Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.
Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they'll let me stay as long as I want.
So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.
Can I pee now?
Oh, get this!
I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.
I get to learn things like hand signals.
Ooh.
There's forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes.
Are you done yet?
You're missing some great stuff out here.
Oh, this is good.
There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for.
But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.
I'll be blowing the whistle.
Amy, get up.
It's time to go to work.
(groans)
This train thing worked out better than I thought.
He's home studying the engineer's manual.
(sighs)
It's so peaceful without him here.
Can I ask you how much that cost?
$4,000-- worth every penny.
(knock on door)
Gentlemen.
Colonel Williams.
Sir.
Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.
Great.
We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
(chuckles)
Don't do that.
What's this?
Oh, nothing.
Just some math we don't need.
This is a different approach.
Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?
It's just a theory.
Uh, it's not even worked out.
Oh. (chuckles)
I want this.
But we've already met the agreed upon specs.
Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.
Sir, uh, i-if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.
It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.
Yeah, I want this.
But that's just a theory.
It's not even a complete thought.
You both make excellent points.
And thank you for presenting it so articulately.
(chuckles) Make this.
(door closes)
The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
All right.
You guys ready to get crazy?
Well, the bra under here ain't beige.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Okay.
You ladies have fun tonight.
Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.
Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
My apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.
Like I said, you ladies have fun.
We will.
Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump.
Let's party.
You know, if you pump at the bar,
I promise we'll get free drinks.
Call if there's any problems.
No.
She's busy.
You call Howard.
Got it.
Call me.
Don't call Howard.
I would never call Howard.
Okay, instead of arguing all night, let's just split up the baby chores.
Yeah, great.
Um, I'll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.
I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Oh, boo-hoo.
I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon.
(electrical crackling)
What is that?
I don't know, but if he yells,
"It's alive," we run.
Oh, hey.
If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.
I'm welding this locomotive engine.
And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?
How'd you even get that up the stairs?
I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."
And then I couldn't, so...
I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.
Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.
Interesting.
Well, so I was right.
Open a window.
It's about to get smug in here.
Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine,
I don't think I can go back to theory.
I'm an engineer now.
And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer.
Not that goofy kind you are.
Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.
Just help us out.
Sorry.
I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.
(laughs)
He's worried about looking foolish.
That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.
Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.
Why are you doing this?
Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish;
so much is unprovable.
But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked.
Then it clacked.
Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.
(imitates train whistle):
Whoo-whoo!
Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?
Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.
Okay, stop that!
No more preschool talk.
Tonight is about having fun.
Nothing says fun like being scolded.
(ringtone playing)
It's Raj.
Everything okay?
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
Hang up!
We don't need help.
I don't need your help deciding when we need help!
Raj, what's going on?
Yes, so,
I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."
It says "Tuesday."
How is that a "T"?
!
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.
Okay, yes,
I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
You're wasting perfectly good milk.
Fine, you drink it.
It's just milk.
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!
Okay, give--
Can you guys handle this or not?
Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time.
(chuckles)
She said I was in charge.
Hmm.
So we just throw this away?
What else are you gonna do with it?
Put it in your coffee?
Well, I don't take it black.
Okay.
This is everything he had on the board.
I'm sure we can figure the rest out.
All right.
(clears throat)
Hmm.
Feel free to jump in.
"Hmm" is all I got.
Oh, we can get this.
Is there any chance it's upside-down?
Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
It's classified.
If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.
Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."
You haven't pitched anything.
Just keep thinking.
I got it.
You really figured it out?
No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.
Oh, you're a genius.
Yeah, I know.
That's not even a math symbol.
That's just Charlie Brown's hair.
Sorry, guys.
This club was so great.
How could they turn it into a bookstore?
I thought we got rid of all those.
Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?
(ringtone playing)
Hello?
(Halley crying) Nothing to worry about.
She's just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.
She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!
She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!
You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?
(whispers):
Wait.
She's settling down.
(Halley quiets)
Oh, okay, false alarm.
Little parenting tip:
sleeping babies hate flash photography.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Hey, there's another dance club nearby.
I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they're open.
Maybe we should just call it a night.
You sure?
They're open till dos.
Yeah, we're all dressed up.
Why go home?
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.
What's going on with you?
I don't know.
This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
I'm not sad.
I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
I'm not sad.
I mean, hello.
Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.
What are you sad about?
Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
You're upset I had a baby?
No, of course not.
I just...
I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.
What feelings?
Pressure!
I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401(k).
Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.
You think that stuff is fun?
Being a parent is terrifying.
I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.
I get that, okay?
It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.
AMY:
Come on.
You've got so much to feel good about.
You've got a great job now.
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.
You make more than I do.
You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.
It's bigger than mine.
And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
I'm not even engaged once.
I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.
I'm not getting any younger.
Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of...
Careful.
The sound of crying can make me lactate.
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
(crying)
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.
(crying)
And there they go.
Ew.
Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.
That's right.
We figured it out all by ourselves.
Wasn't even that hard.
No.
Well, good for you guys.
Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.
Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
No, thanks.
I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.
It's a manifold.
Oh.
Well, I guess it's fixed.
Just look at the board.
That's wrong.
Oh, no!
What should we have done differently?
Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.
Told ya. (scoffs)
Can you fix it for us?
(sighs)
Okay, but this is the last time.
Nice try, blockheads.
Come on, Sheldon.
You can't turn your back on physics.
Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.
But if you really want to learn the mechanical side,
I can teach you anything you want to know.
LEONARD:
And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.
And with all these new skills, you'd be able to fix any model train.
You'd be the king of the train store!
Excuse me.
I have a girlfriend.
I'm already king of the train store.
So, what do you say?
Oh, what choice do I have?
You need me.
I'm like the crankshaft of this team.
That's a turbo.
Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.
I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.
(train chugging, steam hissing)
(train whistle blows)
I apologize that it's so warm in here.
It is warm in here.
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.
Me, too.
May I borrow your water?

Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.
Nicely done, Howard.
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.
Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.
Those are just the things I say out loud.
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.
- What's wrong?
- I'm looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.
That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.
We're good to go.
Yeah.
It doesn't need to be smaller.
Shame on you.
Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?
I'll tell you.
We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup.
Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that's just poodle politics.
Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Fine.
Candy bars.
Now, do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.
Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.
Your work is done.
Go home.
I don't want to go home.
Fine, go for a little walk.

At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
I know.
That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.
You're kidding.
I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.
You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.
I've been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now's the time.
W-We can just lock the door;
you don't have to kill him.
You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.
Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.
As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.
Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.
Really?
Yeah.
Go ahead, open it.
"Congratulations.
"The bearer of this certificate is entitled
"to the ultimate train experience
"at The Nevada Northern Railway.
"You are at the throttle.
"You are the engineer.
You are running the locomotive."
This doesn't happen very often, but here comes a hug.
Oh, dear!
I have to tinkle again!
Okay.
Where were we?
For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?
Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?
I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list.
I warned you, a lot of people apply
- when they're still pregnant.
- Well, I didn't.
I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.
Whoa.
Just trying to help.
Sorry.
Howie's back at work and there's just so much going on.
Is there anything we can do?
Sure.
Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there's a mountain of dirty laundry.
Wash it or burn in, your choice.
Ugh, be right back.
No, no.
I will take care of it.
Oh, thank you.
While I'm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.
All right, you know what you need?
A night away from all of this.
You know, where you can just kind of relax and...
I'm just gonna... turn this off.
Much better.
Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break.
We could go dancing.
- That sounds really nice.
- Oh.
All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.
Okay, that's the one to beat.
Good luck.
People have been saying that for 600 years.
Hey, you're home early.
You'll never believe it.
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.
Wow.
He finally used it.
What'd you do?
No idea.
All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Well, I'm really happy for you.
Oh, no.
It's not just me.
No.
The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.
I give up.
You!
No.
I really give up.
Oh, oh.

GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours.
I can get us there in two.
Hey!
Eh!
Go!
Good morning, Uncle Donald.
You can't wear this to your job interview.
My uniform!
You gotta dress for the job you want, not the job you have, which is no job.
Wah!
Huey, don't touch the stove.
It's hot!
But it's a big day, and a big day calls for a big breakfast!
Bleh!
I'll get the iron.
Ouch!
Ooch.
Stop helping me.
And put on your life vests!
What if the boat goes down while the babysitter's here?
Yes, Uncle Donald.
Where is that babysitter?
Where are you?
!
What?
I didn't give you a new address.
Well, what time can you get here?
I... don't know.
Crazy old bird.
Where can I find another babysitter at 10:00?
- 10:00?
!
- You gotta go!
Aah!
I can't just leave you!
We can survive for a couple of hours!
A couple of hours.
Uh... well, okay.
But just keep those life vests on!
Where's Dewey?
- Sleeping.
- Who's Dewey?
Who's Dewey?
All right, boys, we'll get to Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone.
So long, Dorkburg!
Hello...
Uncle Donald?
What...
What's up?
I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!
You were supposed to get him out by 10:00, Hubert!
You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!
We never get to do anything!
Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat, we've all got to do things we don't want to do.
Destination:
McDuck Manor.
McDuck Manor?
As in Scrooge McDuck?
The bajillionaire?
You're finally gonna sell us.
I'm not gonna sell...
He owes me.
We're gonna meet Scrooge McDuck?
- That guy's amazing!
- What!
I heard he's so epic he defeated a rock giant and carved a statue of himself out of its legs!
I heard he's so smart he solved the mystery of the chupacabra.
Turns out it was just a shaved bear!
I heard that he's so rich he only hunts for treasure to swim in it!
All right, take it down a notch.
It's only a couple of hours.
A couple of hours with the most exciting duck in the world!
With business expanding in the Spoonerville and St. Canard markets, noted in Appendices C, G and 5F, we're also cutting funding to unnecessary departments:
Historical Research, Experimental Tech,
Deep Sea Exploration...
Fantastic.
Back in the bin with ya.
See you tomorrow.
Just another day at the office, eh, Mr. McD?
Been there.
I don't have an office, per se, but in some ways the road is my office.
Hey, that's deep.
I gotta write that down.
Geh!
Eyes on the road, McQuack!
Every dent is coming out of your salary.
Absolutely.
Hey, ya read about that crazy snowstorm on the Drake Barrier Reef?
I'd hate to fly into that one.
See, I'm a bit of a pilot, and, uh...
Oh, okay.
Divider... there you go.
Hit the brakes!
Ech.
Why aren't we moving?
Mrs. B., open up!
I need to get out of here before... he shows up.
Hey!
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, ya deadbeat!
Donald Duck.
Uncle Scrooge.
Uncle Scrooge!
So, you're looking good.
Still living on that boat?
Yup.
Still a trillionaire?
Good, good.
So...
So...
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, you deadbeat!
Oh, here we go!
Giving orders like he's the richest duck in the world!
I am the richest duck in the world!
Now move!
I would love to!
It just so happens I have a job interview.
So why are you standing there yelling?
Mrs. B. said that you would watch the boys!
Can you do that without losing them?
!
- Of course I can!
- Fantastic!
Thank you so much!
You're welcome!
Wait, what now?
Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.
Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.
Yes, Uncle Donald.
I wasn't talking to you.
Whoa!
Talk to your nephews.
Ew.
So, do children still like marbles or...?
Are you really our uncle?
- How old are you?
- What's your net worth?
What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?
Is that fork real silver?
Can I have it?
- How come you never visit?
- 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?
You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.
You used to be a big deal!
Whatever happened to you?
Beakley!
Aah!
You agreed to watch them.
Watch them.
Huey, Louie, the third one...
Please do not leave the designated play area.
A gift from your great-uncle.
You will return them upon your departure.
He's counted them.
Great.
Now we've got two boring uncles.
So, we're totally ditching this room, right?
Yup, and I know just how to do it.
"Used to be a big deal."
Stupid doorknob, come off!
Nailed it!
Can't believe that was your best plan.
Come on, guys, let's go touch some expensive stuff.
- Aah!
- Dewey!
Aah!
I'll put the marbles back, I swear!
Who sent you?
Ma Beagle?
Glomgold?
Answer me!
Uncle Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge?
Oh, my gosh, the nephews!
Wait, you know us?
Of course!
Researching Mr. McDuck and his family is kind of my hobby.
- What?
- What are your blood types?
What's Donald really like?
Who's the evil triplet?
- Louie.
- Eh.
Tell me everything!
Um, we live with our uncle?
On a boat?
Go on.
Kinda it.
We're just a normal, boring family.
Normal, boring?
Hah!
Ohh!
Whoa!
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side with Quackmore Duck twice removed!
And you are?
Oh, right.
Webby van der Quack.
My granny's the housekeeper.
Wait!
Are we... friends now?
If we say yes, will you let us live?
Good one, new best friend!
So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?
Oh!
I'm the best at fun.
Um... yah!
At least it's not the marble room.
Come on, you blaggert.
You won't get the best of Scrooge McDuck!
Hmm.
A little spring cleaning?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Read this.
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.
First time in 50 years.
That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.
A shift in currents may present a pathway to Atlantis, lost city under the sea!
This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?
Nonsense!
I'm no has-been.
They're the has-beens.
I am an am-now.
Make a list!
Four oxygen tanks, two pressure gauges, a pilot...
- I'm a pilot.
- A week's provisions,
- an experimental deep-sea sub...
- I'm a pilot.
And one secretary for an old man who seems to have forgotten that I am not his secretary!
So, eh, not interested?
I have enough excitement caring for Webby.
Perhaps you should spend some time with your family.
Oh, hang up my spats, become the doddering old relic everyone thinks I am, spinning yarns to those loud-mouth young'uns about the man I used to be?
You have avoided them for ten years!
Because family is nothing but trouble!
Oh.
I'm Scrooge McDuck.
I made my name being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.
And I made my money square, on my own, no nephews, no family, no one helped me there, and I don't need help now, and...
Beakley, a little help.
Maybe they're right.
Whoo!
Vent crawl!
You don't get out much, do you?
Eh, Granny's a bit overprotective.
She trains me to be ready for anything, but then she says I've got everything I need in here.
But one day, I'm gonna see the world.
I'm gonna be an explorer!
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.
We could bring you a hamburger.
You really are my best friends.
Welcome to the Wing of Secrets!
I knew it!
Dewey, check it out!
Yeah, whatever.
The Gong of Picchu.
Hit it three times to unleash unspeakable evil.
Uh, what are you doing?
Calling dibs on stuff!
What?
Scrooge is, like, he's, like, super old.
Oh, careful!
Medusa gauntlet.
One touch can turn organic matter to stone.
I'm gonna call this one a maybe.
This place is incredible!
It's fake.
Is that Uncle Donald?
Oh, yeah, he was Mr. McDuck's sidekick!
- Dewey's right.
- Totally fake.
Uncle Donald has never done anything cool.
What?
Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!
Bop bop.
Bop.
Yo, chung chung!
Bop bop!
This has got to be a fake.
And I bet everything else is, too.
That's not true!
What about this picture with chupacabra?
- Photoshop.
- This treasure chest?
Probably bought it at an auction.
This... g-ghost?
You mean this Halloween decoration?
Curse ye, ye scurvy life-lubbers!
It's Captain Peghook, the scourge of the River Styx!
It's real.
It's really, really real!
The Deus Excalibur!
It won't rest until its target's slain!
But he's already dead!
Do not let anything else hit that gong!
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.
Whoa!
Aah!
The headless man-horse!
That one feels self-explanatory.
That's twice!
One more, and something terrible could happen!
What could be worse than this?
What in dismal downs is going on in here?
There it is.
Why aren't you in your rooms?
Rrrawgh!
Aah!
We've got this.
There are four of us and three of them.
If we... wait, never mind.
They teamed up.
Ah, good, that means only one target.
No, get back!
You're old!
Oi, beastie!
What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?
The head of Scrooge McDuck!
Would you settle for his hat?
There's your head.
I should've been more specific!
We can explain.
We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?
Secret museum?
This is the gar-age!
The what?
Do you mean "garage"?
No, that's ridiculous.
If this is a garage, then how do you explain all this amazing stuff?
Like the garden hose of destiny?
Or Montezuma's stack of old magazines?
Or...
Oh, yeah, it's a garage.
Unbelievable.
I invite you into my home...
You locked us in a room!
I gave you marbles!
All we wanted was to hand out with you!
Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!
I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?
Everybody out!
- But we're...
- Out!
Well, what are you gaping at?
The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...
Gold hunting?
Sounds great!
Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!
Aah!
Me money bin!
To your rooms!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go eat a hamburger!
We're in!
Cool.
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.
The hamburger was a metaphor from before.
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
We get it.
But how are we gonna get up there?
I'm a pilot.
Ooh!
Yeah!
Ha ha!
It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal!
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Ugh!
It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!
Take that!
No!
Whoo-hoo!
I thought I told you to go to your...
No time.
We gotta work fast.
Webby, how do we stop it?
It's mystical, so we need a mystical device, like an oblivion mirror or a medusa gauntlet, or...
- Like this?
- Grr.
What?
I was gonna give it back.
Now, how do we get him down there?
Garden hose of destiny!
Launchpad, we need to swing him out.
Nosedive towards the bin and get ready to pull up!
Yes, sir, random kid I just met!
- Any questions?
- Since when is Launchpad a pilot?
You guys, our family is awesome!
Scrooge!
Money!
I knew it!
Aw.
Family truly is the greatest adventure of...
Oh, no, the ground!
In the short time I've known you, you've wrecked my home and my money bin, unleashed several ancient evils, and almost don't be killed, twice.
Four times if you count each monster as an individual time...
That was incredible!
When you pulled me into the airplane and said "No time!"
And who would have thought of a Medusa Gauntlet?
!
Brilliant!
Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and
You kids are nothing but trouble!
Curse me kilts, have I missed trouble!
I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.
You mean...?
Beakley!
Clear my schedule!
I'm taking the wee ones on a field trip.
About time.
And once again, I am not your secre...
Now, let's go find the lost city of Atlantis!
Yeah!
And no one tell your uncle Donald!
Yeah!
Who is that?
You've got the job, Duck!
Seriously?
Oh, boy!
I'm a real accountant!
Accountant?
That was filled yesterday.
You're our new sailor!
Welcome to Glomgold Industries!
Now, what do you know about Atlantis?
Glomgold Industries!
Take an idea.
Make it your own.
Better, faster, cheaper.
That's the motto of the world's most beloved Scottish billionaire duck!
Flintheart Glomgold!
Welcome, new employees, to Glomgold Industries, where our employees are the greatest treasure of all!
Glomgold!
Glomgold!
Glom...
Fine.
Enough glad-handing.
You're here because you're the best of the cheapest.
With your help and my carefully crafted master plan, we'll find the fabled lost Jewel of Atlantis and finally make me the richest duck in the world!
But first, here are your company IDs, also good for 40% off life vest rental in case of emergency.
Gabby McStabberson.
Hack and Slash Smashkinov.
Donald Duck.
Duck?
Ha!
Now remember, bedtime is at 9:00.
And no sugar after 7:00.
Oh, and...
I run a multi-trillion dollar business.
I can handle a few juveniles for the weekend.
You just focus on this new job of yours.
Besides, we've got a pretty low-key day planned.
Hoist the mainsail!
Other boat words, to Atlantis!
Dive!
Dive!
- No, no, wait!
- Aye aye!
Launchpad, the hatch.
Stop the...
Whoo-hoo!
Talk to your uncle.
Hey, Uncle Donald.
Nope, yeah, pretty boring.
We napped, rubbed ointment on our joints, old people stuff.
Oh, what about the dragon?
And the plane crash?
Whoops, 3:00 pm.
Time for dinner.
Bye!
Why didn't you tell him the truth?
You didn't tell your grandma we were going to a dangerous underwater city, did you?
I kinda sorta... didn't tell her anything?
Webby, that's irresponsible!
She'll be worried sick!
Call your grandma this instant and tell her that you are spending the night at a friend's house, okay?
Lying:
It's the responsible thing to do.
Launchpad, have you ever piloted a sub before?
I sunk a helicopter in a wave pool once.
- Same thing?
- I've done more with less.
No matter, I'm back!
Unchartered territory.
Bold new discoveries!
Hello, bingo!
I love road trips!
I've got snacks, a playlist of traditional sea chanties, matching family road trip shirts!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but there's no time.
- But according to the travel itinerary...
- Boo!
Adventure isn't about planning, it's about doing!
So, what can I be in charge of?
- The buzzsaw arm?
- No!
- Sonic cannons?
- No!
Hyper-dense zero-point energy missiles to pierce the scaly hide of a Kraken?
!
None of those things are real things!
This is your first expedition, so just stand back and watch an old pro from a safe distance.
So what is this submarine equipped with?
Seatbelts.
Ha!
Good one.
Classic Scrooge-Dewey banter, the seasoned-but-tired explorer passing the torch to his cocky young successor.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually know our names.
- I'm sorry, what?
- I think he called me her board ones.
Don't be ridiculous!
Hey, Scrooge!
When are we gonna set sail, Scrooge?
In a moment, Sonny Jim.
I will cram it down your throat.
Guys, lighten up!
We're on a deep-sea expedition with Scrooge McDuck!
Mr. McQuack, chart a course.
Next stop, the lost City of Atlantis!
At about 16:00 hours!
Shanty time!
Driving!
Piloting.
Driving, right?
Hey, Scrooge, First Mate Dewey here.
Your map's got us going the long way.
I can probably find a shortcut if you just let me...
Uh-uh, lad.
The shortest distance between two points isn't always a straight line.
Okay, but yes, it is, so if you just go...
Driving!
Huh?
Shortcut achieved!
He'll thank me later.
Oh, you kids'll be the death of me.
Dewey!
Dewey will be the death of you!
Can we make a pit stop?
I have to use the bathroom, but it's, um...
Occupied?
For the love of...
It's the middle of the ocean!
There are no pit stops.
How 'bout that conspicuously unmarked tanker?
Ah, little Dewey's first steps.
And that's Huey in the playoffs.
He was the waterboy.
Oh, look!
That's us climbing the Grand Canyon... display at the supermarket.
Ah...
Ah, I miss them so much, but we need this job.
So, tell me about your family.
I was raised by warrior monks who spoke only the language of the blade.
Uh...
We've got intruders!
Scrooge?
!
What is he doing here?
Strange weather patterns in a mysterious location near treasure.
Ha ha!
I knew he couldn't resist!
Hack, triangulate their sub's course!
We'll tail Scrooge and steal the jewel out from under him!
The boys?
!
Why, you get your hands...
I'm gonna kill him!
Ooh, better idea!
Nab the jewel and kill them all!
Somebody's angling for employee of the month.
The Drake Barrier Reef.
Powerful currents combined with rocky terrain make it nearly impossible to navigate, but on that rare occasion when snow falls above the reef, the currents cool, allowing safe passage to...
Are we there yet?
- I was just about to...
- Right side or the left side?
- If you'd just let me...
- Look!
There that thing is!
We found it!
Whoa!
Yes, good.
Atlantis.
"Ooh!
Aah!"
Thanks for spoiling the moment.
The whole place is upside down!
Oh, well, that's a new one.
Whoa!
Just call your grandma already!
It's no big deal.
Aah!
Remember, you're at a friend's house, okay?
You got this.
Hi, Granny, I'm spending the night at a friend's house so nothing is wrong!
Oh, you don't got this.
Ah-ha!
Well, according to these markings, the Atlantines were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!
You kids best stay by the sub while I scout ahead.
Dewey ran in as soon as you said "death traps."
Come on, Scrooge!
We got this.
Boy!
Oopsie!
Hmm?
Meh.
You made me miss!
Uh... if we get rid of them now, we can't torture them later!
Brilliant!
I want Scrooge alive when I shove the Jewel of Atlantis in his smug face!
He thinks his so rich and so Scottish, but I'm wearing a kilt, McDuck, a kilt!
Dah!
Lad!
I thought the traps would get you for sure!
Stupid upside-down temple!
Nothing cool about walking under buzzsaws!
From now on, don't touch anything!
Maybe Atlantis was an ambitious first outing.
Hi again, Granny!
Still at a friend's house.
Uh, her name?
Sub... ina!
A totally real name for a definitely real person!
Uh, good try.
Launchpad, are you okay?
Ah, a little snake venom never...
Hi, nice to meet you!
I'm everybody's friend!
Um, I've got to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back!
Whoa!
Suspension bridge?
Chasm?
Glowing blue mystical lasers?
Classic!
...Scrooge.
Wait till I get my hands on him.
Even a basic death trap still has the word "death" in the title.
Oh, no.
We'll find another route.
It's not safe for amateur adventurers.
That sounds like a challenge!
I have to stress that is not a challenge.
Is exactly what you say to dissuade the weak of heart from accepting the challenge!
Well, challenge accepted!
There's no challenge!
Dewey!
♪ Dew... ♪
♪ Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey ♪
Huh?
Aah!
♪ Dew, uh, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey ♪
♪ Dew ♪
Oh, no!
♪ How does he Dewey it?
♪
♪ I don't know ♪
♪ Dew!
And now you know ♪
Nailed it!
Sure, if you want to do it the easy way.
Why wouldn't you want to do it the easy way?
You've got to work smarter, lad, not harder.
Aah!
Ugh, "lad."
I don't call you "old man" or "Scotty McTophat."
Respect your elder.
When you adventure with Scrooge McDuck...
But I'm not.
You want me to adventure behind Scrooge McDuck, or wait by the sub!
I might as well be back on the houseboat!
Because you have no idea what you're doing!
So show me!
Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!
I'm not lumping you all together.
Oh, really?
Which triplet am I?
It's...
Bluey?
Aah!
Ow!
Ugh!
Fantastic.
You see what I'm talking about?
You four find another way 'round!
We're going to... push onward, apparently.
Why, this is no bathroom!
This shortcuts leads right to the treasure chamber!
I don't even know why I hired the rest of you!
Help him up!
Ow.
Ouch!
Owie!
Owie!
Maybe I could just hire some family.
Then they'd have to listen to me.
There she is, the Jewel of Atlantis!
- Who's that?
- Flintheart Glomgold, the poor man's version of me, which, to be fair, still makes him insanely rich.
Load up the sub.
They've got Uncle Donald?
What?
Let go of my uncle!
- No.
- I wasn't prepared for that.
What are you doing here, Flinty?
What are you doing here, Scrooge?
I told you to keep the boys safe!
Ah, they're perfectly fine.
Oh, yeah?
Where are the other two?
Back safe in the room with the fire and the snakes.
- What?
- Ah, Scroogy.
I see you know my newest employee.
Your new job is with my sworn enemy?
I can't keep track of all your sworn enemies!
Now, now, Donald has been a model employee, and an excellent prisoner.
Yeah!
Wait, what?
Hiring my own nephew in order to use him against me?
Now, that is good planning.
Have fun being the second richest duck in the world... for the next five minutes.
I'd like to point out that this trap was not my fault.
Junior Woodchuck Rule 841:
There's always another way around.
Hup!
Hup!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Oh, look!
Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.
We don't want to be rude, so... good-bye?
And you're done.
Yeah, you're never gonna be able to back up that lie.
That was crazy!
Whoa!
Oh, hej, Beakley!
Subina...
Take 'em down!
Ojda.
We gotta stop the water!
Oh, no.
I knew it!
I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!
Not the time, Donald.
Crazy old man!
All you care about is your next adventure.
This is the Spear of Selene all over again!
I was not responsible for the Spear of Selene!
Stop!
Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble, but I was so caught up in...
Why is there a lamp on the floor?
What?
Atlantis is upside down.
That means that lamp was supposed to be on the floor surrounded by all this treasure.
Attaboy, lad.
Keep going.
But why would you surround that thing with treasure unless...
That's the real Jewel of Atlantis!
That thing lit up when the trap was sprung.
I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!
Uncle Donald, you gotta let the room flood so I can grab the jewel.
That's crazy!
I'm supposed to, what, let go?
Trust you?
Well, yeah, that's kind of all you can do.
This is a surprisingly insightful death trap!
Hey!
We're gonna be okay!
Oh, yeah, those guys.
Huey and Louie!
Are doing okay!
Wait!
Where's Glomgold?
Hey, team.
Wanted to thank you for keeping Scrooge's kin busy while I escape with the jewel and blow up Atlantis with my most hated rival inside.
But I thought employees were greatest treasure of all!
Don't be ridiculous!
Treasure is the greatest treasure of all.
That's why it's called treasure!
Glomgold out!
We have to go!
- Huh?
- Mr. Duck.
Could we, um, maybe bum a ride with you?
That was some quick thinking.
You just may be an adventurer yet, Dewey.
Aye, aye.
Okay.
Settle down.
Ha ha!
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is with great pride that I, Flintheart Glomgold, present...
The Jewel of Atlantis!
What?
!
Is that Scrooge McDuck?
Mr. McDuck...
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.
Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?
That bauble?
That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
No, it's not!
Curse you, McDuck!
- Webby.
Uncle Hampus.
- How long?
Whole time.
Granny, I can explain.
Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.
- Now, Donald, don't...
- Stop.
I admit I'm a little overprotective.
A little?
!
No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.
Uncle Donald?
It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.
Sometimes, like birthdays or federal holidays.
Nothing too...
Ooh!
I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.
I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.
There you have it.
Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back, with family in tow, solving mysteries and rewriting history.
Easy.
A little to the left.
No, no, no, no!
Did I do it good?
Mom?
[Caws]
Hey!
Eh!
Go!
[Murmurs]
[Thumping]
[Clamor]
[Sputtering]
Good morning, Uncle Donald.
You can't wear this to your job interview.
[Sputtering] My uniform!
You gotta dress for the job you want, not the job you have, which is no job.
Wah!
Huey, don't touch the stove.
It's hot!
But it's a big day, and a big day calls for a big breakfast!
[Deflating Sound]
Bleh!
I'll get the iron.
Ouch!
Ooch.
[Sputtering]
Stop helping me.
And put on your life vests!
What if the boat goes down while the babysitter's here?
BOTH:
Yes, Uncle Donald.
Where is that babysitter?
Where are you?
!
What?
I didn't give you a new address.
Well, what time can you get here?
I... don't know.
Crazy old bird.
Where can I find another babysitter at 10:00?
- 10:00?
!
- You gotta go!
Aah!
I can't just leave you!
We can survive for a couple of hours!
A couple of hours.
Uh... well, okay.
But just keep those life vests on!
[Engine Starts]
Where's Dewey?
- Sleeping.
- Who's Dewey?
Who's Dewey?
All right, boys, we'll get to Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone.
So long, Dorkburg!
Hello...
Uncle Donald?
What...
What's up?
I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!
You were supposed to get him out by 10:00, Hubert!
You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!
We never get to do anything!
Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat, we've all got to do things we don't want to do.
[Beeps]
Destination:
McDuck Manor.
McDuck Manor?
As in Scrooge McDuck?
The bajillionaire?
You're finally gonna sell us.
I'm not gonna sell...
He owes me.
We're gonna meet Scrooge McDuck?
- That guy's amazing!
- What!
I heard he's so epic he defeated a rock giant and carved a statue of himself out of its legs!
I heard he's so smart he solved the mystery of the chupacabra.
Turns out it was just a shaved bear!
I heard that he's so rich he only hunts for treasure to swim in it!
All right, take it down a notch.
It's only a couple of hours.
A couple of hours with the most exciting duck in the world!
With business expanding in the Spoonerville and St. Canard markets, noted in Appendices C, G and 5F, we're also cutting funding to unnecessary departments:
Historical Research, Experimental Tech,
Deep Sea Exploration...
Fantastic.
Back in the bin with ya.
See you tomorrow. [Sighs]
[Clinks]
[Grunting]
[Tires Squealing]
[Barking]
Just another day at the office, eh, Mr. McD?
[Laughs] Been there.
I don't have an office, per se, but in some ways the road is my office.
Hey, that's deep.
I gotta write that down.
[Crash]
Geh!
Eyes on the road, McQuack!
Every dent is coming out of your salary.
Absolutely.
Hey, ya read about that crazy snowstorm on the Drake Barrier Reef?
I'd hate to fly into that one.
See, I'm a bit of a pilot, and, uh...
Oh, okay.
Divider... there you go.
Hit the brakes!
[Tires Squealing]
Ech.
Why aren't we moving?
Mrs. B., open up!
I need to get out of here before...
[Honking] he shows up.
Hey!
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, ya deadbeat!
Donald Duck.
Uncle Scrooge.
- Uncle Scrooge!
- [All Jeering]
So, you're looking good.
Still living on that boat?
Yup.
Still a trillionaire?
[Bird Calls]
Good, good.
So...
So...
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, you deadbeat!
Oh, here we go!
Giving orders like he's the richest duck in the world!
I am the richest duck in the world!
Now move!
I would love to!
It just so happens I have a job interview.
So why are you standing there yelling?
Mrs. B. said that you would watch the boys!
Can you do that without losing them?
!
- Of course I can!
- Fantastic!
Thank you so much!
You're welcome!
Wait, what now?
[Car Door Slams]
Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.
Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.
ALL:
Yes, Uncle Donald.
I wasn't talking to you.
Whoa!
Talk to your nephews.
Ew.
[Startles]
So, do children still like marbles or...?
Are you really our uncle?
- How old are you?
- What's your net worth?
What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?
Is that fork real silver?
Can I have it?
- How come you never visit?
- 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?
You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.
You used to be a big deal!
Whatever happened to you?
Beakley!
Aah!
You agreed to watch them.
Watch them.
Huey, Louie, the third one...
Please do not leave the designated play area.
- [Clinks]
- A gift from your great-uncle.
You will return them upon your departure.
He's counted them.
[Lock Clicks]
Great.
Now we've got two boring uncles.
So, we're totally ditching this room, right?
Yup, and I know just how to do it.
[Gasps]
[Grumbling]
"Used to be a big deal."
[Beating]
Stupid doorknob, come off!
Nailed it!
Can't believe that was your best plan.
Come on, guys, let's go touch some expensive stuff.
- Aah!
- Dewey!
BOTH:
Aah!
I'll put the marbles back, I swear!
Who sent you?
Ma Beagle?
Glomgold?
Answer me!
[Sobbing] Uncle Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge?
Oh, my gosh, the nephews!
- Wait, you know us?
- [Grunting]
Of course!
Researching Mr. McDuck and his family is kind of my hobby.
- What?
- What are your blood types?
What's Donald really like?
Who's the evil triplet?
- Louie.
- Eh.
Tell me everything!
Um, we live with our uncle?
On a boat?
Go on.
Kinda it.
We're just a normal, boring family.
Normal, boring?
Hah!
ALL:
Ohh!
Whoa!
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side with Quackmore Duck twice removed!
And you are?
Oh, right.
Webby van der Quack.
My granny's the housekeeper.
Wait!
Are we... friends now?
If we say yes, will you let us live?
[Scoffs] Good one, new best friend!
So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?
Oh!
I'm the best at fun.
Um... yah!
At least it's not the marble room.
[Grunting]
Come on, you blaggert.
You won't get the best of Scrooge McDuck!
Hmm.
A little spring cleaning?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Read this.
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.
First time in 50 years.
That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.
A shift in currents may present a pathway to Atlantis, lost city under the sea!
This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?
Nonsense!
I'm no has-been.
They're the has-beens.
I am an am-now.
Make a list!
Four oxygen tanks, two pressure gauges, a pilot...
- I'm a pilot.
- A week's provisions,
- an experimental deep-sea sub...
- I'm a pilot.
And one secretary for an old man who seems to have forgotten that I am not his secretary!
So, eh, not interested?
I have enough excitement caring for Webby.
Perhaps you should spend some time with your family.
Oh, hang up my spats, become the doddering old relic everyone thinks I am, spinning yarns to those loud-mouth young'uns about the man I used to be?
You have avoided them for ten years!
Because family is nothing but trouble!
[Gasps] Oh.
I'm Scrooge McDuck.
I made my name being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.
And I made my money square, on my own, no nephews, no family, no one helped me there, and I don't need help now, and...
[Clattering]
Beakley, a little help.
Maybe they're right.
Whoo!
Vent crawl!
[Both Groan]
You don't get out much, do you?
Eh, Granny's a bit overprotective.
She trains me to be ready for anything, but then she says I've got everything I need in here.
But one day, I'm gonna see the world.
I'm gonna be an explorer!
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.
We could bring you a hamburger.
You really are my best friends.
Welcome to the Wing of Secrets!
I knew it!
Dewey, check it out!
Yeah, whatever.
The Gong of Picchu.
Hit it three times to unleash unspeakable evil.
Uh, what are you doing?
Calling dibs on stuff!
What?
Scrooge is, like, he's, like, super old.
Oh, careful!
Medusa gauntlet.
One touch can turn organic matter to stone.
[Imitates Solidifying]
I'm gonna call this one a maybe.
This place is incredible!
It's fake.
Is that Uncle Donald?
Oh, yeah, he was Mr. McDuck's sidekick!
- Dewey's right.
- Totally fake.
Uncle Donald has never done anything cool.
What?
Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!
[Stuttering]
[Phone Rings]

Bop bop.
Bop.
Yo, chung chung!
Bop bop!
[Exclaiming]

This has got to be a fake.
And I bet everything else is, too.
That's not true!
What about this picture with chupacabra?
- Photoshop.
- This treasure chest?
Probably bought it at an auction.
This... g-ghost?
You mean this Halloween decoration?
Curse ye, ye scurvy life-lubbers!
It's Captain Peghook, the scourge of the River Styx!
It's real.
It's really, really real!
[Evil Laughter]
The Deus Excalibur!
It won't rest until its target's slain!
But he's already dead!
[Gong Rings]
[Gasps] Do not let anything else hit that gong!
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Whoa!
Aah!
- [Whinnies]
[Exclaims]
The headless man-horse!
That one feels self-explanatory.
[Rings]
That's twice!
One more, and something terrible could happen!
What could be worse than this?
What in dismal downs is going on in here?
ALL:
There it is.
Why aren't you in your rooms?
[Screaming]
Rrrawgh!
- Aah!
- [Evil Laughter]
[Grunts]
[Neighs]
We've got this.
There are four of us and three of them.
If we... wait, never mind.
They teamed up.
[Evil Laughter]
Ah, good, that means only one target.
No, get back!
You're old!
Oi, beastie!
What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?
The head of Scrooge McDuck!
[Cracking]
Would you settle for his hat?
[Roaring]
[Groans]
[Blade Rings]
There's your head.
I should've been more specific!
[Whinnies]
[Celebrating]
[Pounds]
We can explain.
We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?
Secret museum?
This is the gar-age!
The what?
Do you mean "garage"?
No, that's ridiculous.
If this is a garage, then how do you explain all this amazing stuff?
Like the garden hose of destiny?
Or Montezuma's stack of old magazines?
Or...
Oh, yeah, it's a garage.
Unbelievable.
I invite you into my home...
You locked us in a room!
I gave you marbles!
All we wanted was to hand out with you!
Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!
I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?
Everybody out!
- But we're...
- Out!
Well, what are you gaping at?
The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
[Crackling]
Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...
Gold hunting?
Sounds great!
Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!
[Sniffing]
Aah!
Me money bin!
To your rooms!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go eat a hamburger!
We're in!
Cool.
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.
The hamburger was a metaphor from before.
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
We get it.
But how are we gonna get up there?
I'm a pilot.
Ooh!
Yeah!
Ha ha!
It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal!
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Ugh!
It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!
Take that!
No!
[Straining]
Whoo-hoo!
I thought I told you to go to your...
No time.
We gotta work fast.
Webby, how do we stop it?
It's mystical, so we need a mystical device, like an oblivion mirror or a medusa gauntlet, or...
- Like this?
- Grr.
What?
I was gonna give it back.
Now, how do we get him down there?
Garden hose of destiny!
Launchpad, we need to swing him out.
Nosedive towards the bin and get ready to pull up!
Yes, sir, random kid I just met!
- Any questions?
- Since when is Launchpad a pilot?
[Clinks]
You guys, our family is awesome!
ALL:
Scrooge!
[Gasping]

NEPHEW:
Money!
I knew it!
Aw.
Family truly is the greatest adventure of...
Oh, no, the ground!
[Crashing]
In the short time I've known you, you've wrecked my home and my money bin, unleashed several ancient evils, and almost don't be killed, twice.
Four times if you count each monster as an individual time...
[Laughter]
That was incredible!
When you pulled me into the airplane and said "No time!"
And who would have thought of a Medusa Gauntlet?
!
Brilliant!
Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and [Laughter]
You kids are nothing but trouble!
Curse me kilts, have I missed trouble!
I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.
- [Phone Ringing]
- You mean...?
Beakley!
Clear my schedule!
I'm taking the wee ones on a field trip.
About time.
And once again, I am not your secre...
Now, let's go find the lost city of Atlantis!
ALL:
Yeah!
And no one tell your uncle Donald!
ALL:
Yeah!

Oh, what about the dragon?
And the plane crash?
Whoops, 3:00 pm.
Time for dinner.
Bye!
Why didn't you tell him the truth?
You didn't tell your grandma we were going to a dangerous underwater city, did you?
I kinda sorta... didn't tell her anything?
Webby, that's irresponsible!
She'll be worried sick!
Call your grandma this instant and tell her that you are spending the night at a friend's house, okay?
Lying:
It's the responsible thing to do.
Launchpad, have you ever piloted a sub before?
I sunk a helicopter in a wave pool once.
- Same thing?
- I've done more with less.
No matter, I'm back!
Unchartered territory.
Bold new discoveries!
Hello, bingo!
I love road trips!
I've got snacks, a playlist of traditional sea chanties, matching family road trip shirts!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but there's no time.
- But according to the travel itinerary...
- Boo!
Adventure isn't about planning, it's about doing!
So, what can I be in charge of?
- The buzzsaw arm?
- No!
- Sonic cannons?
- No!
Hyper-dense zero-point energy missiles to pierce the scaly hide of a Kraken?
!
None of those things are real things!
This is your first expedition, so just stand back and watch an old pro from a safe distance.
So what is this submarine equipped with?

Ha!
Good one.
Classic Scrooge-Dewey banter, the seasoned-but-tired explorer passing the torch to his cocky young successor.

Hey, Scrooge!
When are we gonna set sail, Scrooge?
In a moment, Sonny Jim.
I will cram it down your throat.
Guys, lighten up!
We're on a deep-sea expedition with Scrooge McDuck!

Okay, but yes, it is, so if you just go...

There are no pit stops.
How 'bout that conspicuously unmarked tanker?
Ah, little Dewey's first steps.

We'll tail Scrooge and steal the jewel out from under him!

Oh, you don't got this.
Ah-ha!
Well, according to these markings, the Atlantines were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!

Load up the sub.
They've got Uncle Donald?
What?
Let go of my uncle!
- No.
- I wasn't prepared for that.
What are you doing here, Flinty?
What are you doing here, Scrooge?
I told you to keep the boys safe!
Ah, they're perfectly fine.
Oh, yeah?
Where are the other two?
Back safe in the room with the fire and the snakes.
- What?
- Ah, Scroogy.
I see you know my newest employee.
Your new job is with my sworn enemy?
I can't keep track of all your sworn enemies!
Now, now, Donald has been a model employee, and an excellent prisoner.
Yeah!
Wait, what?
Hiring my own nephew in order to use him against me?
Now, that is good planning.
Have fun being the second richest duck in the world... for the next five minutes.

Stop!
Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble, but I was so caught up in...
Why is there a lamp on the floor?
What?
Atlantis is upside down.
That means that lamp was supposed to be on the floor surrounded by all this treasure.
Attaboy, lad.
Keep going.
But why would you surround that thing with treasure unless...
BOTH:
That's the real Jewel of Atlantis!
That thing lit up when the trap was sprung.
I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!
Uncle Donald, you gotta let the room flood so I can grab the jewel.
That's crazy!
I'm supposed to, what, let go?
Trust you?
Well, yeah, that's kind of all you can do.
This is a surprisingly insightful death trap!

Are doing okay!
[Grunting]
Wait!
Where's Glomgold?
[Walkie-Talkie Crackles]
GLOMGOLD:
Hey, team.
Wanted to thank you for keeping Scrooge's kin busy while I escape with the jewel and blow up Atlantis with my most hated rival inside.
But I thought employees were greatest treasure of all!
Don't be ridiculous!
Treasure is the greatest treasure of all.
That's why it's called treasure!
Glomgold out!
We have to go!
- Huh?
- Mr. Duck.
Could we, um, maybe bum a ride with you?
That was some quick thinking.
You just may be an adventurer yet, Dewey.
[Reporters Clamoring]
Aye, aye.
Okay.
Settle down.
Ha ha!
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is with great pride that I, Flintheart Glomgold, present...
The Jewel of Atlantis!
What?
!
Is that Scrooge McDuck?
- Mr. McDuck...
- [Clamor Resumes]
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.
Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?
That bauble?
That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
No, it's not!
[Splashing]
[Roaring]
[Screams] Curse you, McDuck!
- Webby.
Uncle Hampus.
- How long?
Whole time.
Granny, I can explain.
Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.
- Now, Donald, don't...
- Stop.
I admit I'm a little overprotective.
LOUIE:
A little?
!
No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.
Uncle Donald?
It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.
[Cheering]
Sometimes, like birthdays or federal holidays.
- Nothing too...
- [Bang]
Ooh!
I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.
I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.
[Chuckles]
[Cheering]
There you have it.
Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back, with family in tow, solving mysteries and rewriting history.
DONALD:
Easy.
A little to the left.
No, no, no, no!
Did I do it good?
[Laughter]
[Screams]
Mom?

*DUCK TALES (2017)* Season 01 Episode 01 Title: "Woo-oo!"
Hey!
Eh!
Go!
Good morning, Uncle Donald.
You can't wear this to your job interview.
My uniform!
You gotta dress for the job you want, not the job you have, which is no job.
Wah!
Huey, don't touch the stove.
It's hot!
But it's a big day, and a big day calls for a big breakfast!
Bleh!
I'll get the iron.
Ouch!
Ooch.
Stop helping me.
And put on your life vests!
What if the boat goes down while the babysitter's here?
Yes, Uncle Donald.
Where is that babysitter?
Where are you?
!
What?
I didn't give you a new address.
Well, what time can you get here?
I... don't know.
Crazy old bird.
Where can I find another babysitter at 10:00?
- 10:00?
!
- You gotta go!
Aah!
I can't just leave you!
We can survive for a couple of hours!
A couple of hours.
Uh... well, okay.
But just keep those life vests on!
- Where's Dewey?
- Sleeping.
Who's Dewey?
Who's Dewey?
All right, boys, we'll getto Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone.
So long, Dorkburg!
Hello...
Uncle Donald?
What...
What's up?
I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!
You were supposed to get him out by 10:00, Hubert!
You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!
We never get to do anything!
Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat, we've all got to do things we don't want to do.
Destination:
McDuck Manor.
McDuck Manor?
As in Scrooge McDuck?
The bajillionaire?
You're finally gonna sell us.
I'm not gonna sell...
He owes me.
We're gonna meet Scrooge McDuck?
- That guy's amazing!
- What!
I heard he's so epic he defeated a rock giant and carved a statue of himself out of its legs!
I heard he's so smart he solved the mystery of the Chupacabra.
Turns out it was just a shaved bear!
I heard that he's so rich he only hunts for treasure to swim in it!
All right, take it down a notch.
It's only a couple of hours.
A couple of hours with the most exciting duck in the world!
With business expanding in the Spoonerville and St. Canard markets, noted in Appendices C, G and 5F, we're also cutting funding to unnecessary departments:
Historical Research, Experimental Tech,
Deep Sea Exploration...
Fantastic.
Back in the bin with ya.
See you tomorrow.
Just another day at the office, eh, Mr. McD?
Been there.
I don't have an office, per se, but in some ways the road is my office.
Hey, that's deep.
I gotta write that down.
Geh!
Eyes on the road, McQuack!
Every dent is coming out of your salary.
Absolutely.
Hey, ya read about that crazy snowstorm on the Drake Barrier Reef?
I'd hate to fly into that one.
See, I'm a bit of a pilot, and, uh...
Oh, okay.
Divider... there you go.
Hit the brakes!
Ech.
Why aren't we moving?
Mrs. B., open up!
I need to get out of here before... he shows up.
Hey!
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, ya deadbeat!
Donald Duck.
Uncle Scrooge.
Uncle Scrooge!
So, you're looking good.
Still living on that boat?
Yup.
Still a trillionaire?
Good, good.
So...
So...
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, you deadbeat!
Oh, here we go!
Giving orders like he's the richest duck in the world!
I am the richest duck in the world!
- Now move!
- I would love to!
It just so happens I have a job interview.
So why are you standing there yelling?
Mrs. B. said that you would watch the boys!
Can you do that without losing them?
!
- Of course I can!
- Fantastic!
Thank you so much!
You're welcome!
Wait, what now?
Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.
Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.
Yes, Uncle Donald.
I wasn't talking to you.
Whoa!
Talk to your nephews.
Ew.
So, do children still like marbles or...?
- Are you really our uncle?
- How old are you?
What's your net worth?
What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?
Is that fork real silver?
Can I have it?
- How come you never visit?
- 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?
You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.
You used to be a big deal!
Whatever happened to you?
Beakley!
Aah!
You agreed to watch them.
Watch them.
Huey, Louie, the third one...
Please do not leave the designated play area.
A gift from your great-uncle.
You will return them upon your departure.
He's counted them.
Great.
Now we've got two boring uncles.
So, we're totally ditching this room, right?
Yup, and I know just how to do it.
"Used to be a big deal."
Stupid doorknob, come off!
Nailed it!
Can't believe that was your best plan.
Come on, guys, let's go touch some expensive stuff.
- Aah!
- Dewey!
Aah!
Ah, ha ah!
I'll put the marbles back, I swear!
Who sent you?
Ma Beagle?
Glomgold?
Answer me!
Uncle Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge?
Oh, my gosh, the nephews!
Wait, you know us?
Of course!
Researching Mr. McDuck and his family is kind of my hobby.
- What?
- What are your blood types?
What's Donald really like?
Who's the evil triplet?
- Louie.
- Eh.
Tell me everything!
Um, we live with our uncle?
On a boat?
Go on.
Kinda it.
We're just a normal, boring family.
Normal, boring?
Hah!
Ohh!
Whoa!
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side with Quackmore Duck twice removed!
And you are?
Oh, right.
Webby van der Quack.
My granny's the housekeeper.
Wait!
Are we...
friends now?
If we say yes, will you let us live?
Good one, new best friend!
So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?
Oh!
I'm the best at fun.
Um... yah!
At least it's not the marble room.
Come on, you blaggert.
You won't get the best of Scrooge McDuck!
Hmm.
A little spring cleaning?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Read this.
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.
First time in 50 years.
That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.
A shift in currents may present a pathway to Atlantis, lost city under the sea!
This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?
Nonsense!
I'm no has-been.
They're the has-beens.
I am an am-now.
Make a list!
Four oxygen tanks, two pressure gauges, a pilot...
- I'm a pilot.
- A week's provisions,
- an experimental deep-sea sub...
- I'm a pilot.
And one secretary for an old man who seems to have forgotten that I am not his secretary!
So, eh, not interested?
I have enough excitement caring for Webby.
Perhaps you should spend some time with your family.
Oh, hang up my spats, become the doddering old relic everyone thinks I am, spinning yarns to those loud-mouth young'uns about the man I used to be?
You have avoided them for ten years!
Because family is nothing but trouble!
Oh.
I'm Scrooge McDuck.
I made my name being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.
And I made my money square, on my own, no nephews, no family, no one helped me there, and I don't need help now, and...
Beakley, a little help.
Maybe they're right.
Whoo!
Vent crawl!
You don't get out much, do you?
Eh, Granny's a bit overprotective.
She trains me to be ready for anything, but then she says I've got everything I need in here.
But one day, I'm gonna see the world.
I'm gonna be an explorer!
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.
We could bring you a hamburger.
You really are my best friends.
Welcome to the Wing of Secrets!
I knew it!
Dewey, check it out!
Yeah, whatever.
The Gong of Picchu.
Hit it three times to unleash unspeakable evil.
Uh, what are you doing?
Calling dibs on stuff!
What?
Scrooge is, like, he's, like, super old.
Oh, careful!
Medusa gauntlet.
One touch can turn organic matter to stone.
I'm gonna call this one a maybe.
This place is incredible!
It's fake.
Is that Uncle Donald?
Oh, yeah, he was Mr. McDuck's sidekick!
- Dewey's right.
- Totally fake.
Uncle Donald has never done anything cool.
What?
Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!
Bop bop.
Bop.
Yo, chung chung!
Bop bop!
This has got to be a fake.
And I bet everything else is, too.
That's not true!
What about this picture with chupacabra?
- Photoshop.
- This treasure chest?
Probably bought it at an auction.
This... g-ghost?
You mean this Halloween decoration?
Curse ye, ye scurvy life-lubbers!
It's Captain Peghook, the scourge of the River Styx!
It's real.
It's really, really real!
The Deus Excalibur!
It won't rest until its target's slain!
But he's already dead!
Do not let anything else hit that gong!
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.
Whoa!
Aah!
The headless man-horse!
That one feels self-explanatory.
That's twice!
One more, and something terrible could happen!
What could be worse than this?
What in dismal downs is going on in here?
There it is.
Why aren't you in your rooms?
Rrrawgh!
Aah!
We've got this.
There are four of us and three of them.
If we... wait, never mind.
They teamed up.
Ah, good, that means only one target.
No, get back!
You're old!
Oi, beastie!
What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?
The head of Scrooge McDuck!
Would you settle for his hat?
There's your head.
I should've been more specific!
We can explain.
We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?
Secret museum?
This is the gar-age!
The what?
Do you mean "garage"?
No, that's ridiculous.
If this is a garage, then how do you explain all this amazing stuff?
Like the garden hose of destiny?
Or Montezuma's stack of old magazines?
Or...
Oh, yeah, it's a garage.
Unbelievable.
I invite you into my home...
You locked us in a room!
I gave you marbles!
All we wanted was to hand out with you!
Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!
I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?
Everybody out!
- But we're...
- Out!
Well, what are you gaping at?
The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...
Gold hunting?
Sounds great!
Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!
Aah!
Me money bin!
To your rooms!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go eat a hamburger!
We're in!
Cool.
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.
The hamburger was a metaphor from before.
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
We get it.
But how are we gonna get up there?
I'm a pilot.
Ooh!
Yeah!
Ha ha!
It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal!
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Ugh!
It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!
Take that!
Nooooooooooo!
Whoo-hoo!
I thought I told you to go to your...
No time.
We gotta work fast.
Webby, how do we stop it?
It's mystical, so we need a mystical device, like an oblivion mirror or a medusa gauntlet, or...
- Like this?
- Grr.
What?
I was gonna give it back.
Now, how do we get him down there?
Garden hose of destiny!
Launchpad, we need to swing him out.
Nosedive towards the bin and get ready to pull up!
Yes, sir, random kid I just met!
Any questions?
-Since when is Launchpad a pilot?
You guys, our family is awesome!
Scrooge!
Money!
I knew it!
Aw.
Family truly is the greatest adventure of...
Oh, no, the ground!
In the short time I've known you, you've wrecked my home and my money bin, unleashed several ancient evils, and almost don't be killed twice
Four times if you count each monster as an individual time...
That was incredible!
When you pulled me into the airplane and said "No time!"
And who would have thought of a Medusa Gauntlet?
!
Brilliant!
Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and
You kids are nothing but trouble!
Curse me kilts, have I missed trouble!
I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.
You mean...?
Beakley!
Clear my schedule!
I'm taking the wee ones on a field trip.
About time.
And once again, I am not your secre...
Now, let's go find the lost city of Atlantis!
Yeah!
And no one tell your uncle Donald!
Yeah!
Who is that?
You've got the job, Duck!
Seriously?
Oh, boy!
I'm a real accountant!
Accountant?
That was filled yesterday.
You're our new sailor!

Gabby McStabberson.
Hack and Slash Smashkinov.
Donald Duck.
Duck?
Ha!
Now remember, bedtime is at 9:00.
And no sugar after 7:00.
Oh, and...
I run a multi-trillion dollar business.
I can handle a few juveniles for the weekend.
You just focus on this new job of yours.
Besides, we've got a pretty low-key day planned.
Hoist the mainsail!
Other boat words, to Atlantis!
Dive!
Dive!
- No, no, wait!
- Aye aye!
Launchpad, the hatch.
Stop the...
Whoo-hoo!
Talk to your uncle.
Hey, Uncle Donald.
Nope, yeah, pretty boring.
We napped, rubbed ointment on our joints, old people stuff.
Oh, what about the dragon?
And the plane crash?
And...
Whoops, 3:00 pm.
Time for dinner.
Bye!
Why didn't you tell him the truth?
You didn't tell your grandma we were going to a dangerous underwater city, did you?
I kinda sorta...
didn't tell her anything?
Webby, that's irresponsible!
She'll be worried sick!
Call your grandma this instant and tell her that you are spending the night at a friend's house, okay?
Lying: it's the responsible thing to do.
Launchpad, have you ever piloted a sub before?
I sunk a helicopter in a wave pool once.
- Same thing?
- I've done more with less.
No matter, I'm back!
Unchartered territory.
Bold new discoveries!
Hello, bingo!
I love road trips!
I've got snacks, a playlist of traditional sea chanties, matching family road trip shirts!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but there's no time.
But according to the travel itinerary...
-Boo!
Adventure isn't about planning, it's about doing!
So, what can I be in charge of?
- The buzzsaw arm?
- No!
- Sonic cannons?
- No!
Hyper-dense zero-point energy missiles to pierce the scaly hide of a Kraken?
!
None of those things are real things!
This is your first expedition, so just stand back and watch an old pro from a safe distance.
So what is this submarine equipped with?
Seatbelts.
Ha!
Good one.
Classic Scrooge-Dewey banter, the seasoned-but-tired explorer passing the torch to his cocky young successor.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually know our names.
- I'm sorry, what?
- I think he called me her board ones.
Don't be ridiculous!
Hey, Scrooge!
When are we gonna set sail, Scrooge?
In a moment, Sonny Jim.
I will cram it down your throat.
Guys, lighten up!
We're on a deep-sea expedition with Scrooge McDuck!
Mr. McQuack, chart a course.
Next stop, the lost City of Atlantis!
At about 16:00 hours!

Driving, right?
Hey, Scrooge, First Mate Dewey here.
Your map's got us going the long way.
I can probably find a shortcut if you just let me...
Uh-uh, lad.
The shortest distance between two points isn't always a straight line.
Okay, but yes, it is, so if you just go...
Driving!
Huh?
Shortcut achieved!
He'll thank me later.
Oh, you kids'll be the death of me.
Dewey!
Dewey will be the death of you!
Can we make a pit stop?
I have to use the bathroom, but it's, um...
Occupied?
For the love of...
It's the middle of the ocean!
There are no pit stops.
How 'bout that conspicuously unmarked tanker?
Ah, little Dewey's first steps.
And that's Huey in the playoffs.
He was the waterboy.
Oh, look!
That's us climbing the Grand Canyon... display at the supermarket.
Ah...
Ah, I miss them so much, but we need this job.
So, tell me about your family.
I was raised by warrior monks who spoke only the language of the blade.
Uh...
We've got intruders!
Scrooge?
!
What is he doing here?
Strange weather patterns in a mysterious location near treasure.
Ha ha!
I knew he couldn't resist!
Hack, triangulate their sub's course!
We'll tail Scrooge and steal the jewel out from under him!
The boys?
!
Why, you get your hands...
I'm gonna kill him!
Ooh, better idea!
Nab the jewel and kill them all!
Somebody's angling for employee of the month.

The Drake Barrier Reef.
Powerful currents combined with rocky terrain make it nearly impossible to navigate, but on that rare occasion when snow falls above the reef, the currents cool, allowing safe passage to...
Are we there yet?
- I was just about to...
- Right side or the left side?
- If you'd just let me...
- Look!
There that thing is!
We found it!
Whoa!
Yes, good.
Atlantis.
"Ooh!
Aah!"
Thanks for spoiling the moment.
The whole place is upside down!
Oh, well, that's a new one.
Whoa!
Just call your grandma already!
It's no big deal.
Aah!
Remember, you're at a friend's house, okay?
You got this.
Hi, Granny, I'm spending the night at a friend's house so nothing is wrong!
Oh, you don't got this.
Ah-ha!
Well, according to these markings, the Atlantines were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!
You kids best stay by the sub while I scout ahead.
Dewey ran in as soon as you said "death traps."
Come on, Scrooge!
We got this.
Boy!
Oopsie!
Hmm?
Meh.
You made me miss!
Uh...
if we get rid of them now, we can't torture them later!
Brilliant!
I want Scrooge alive when I shove the Jewel of Atlantis in his smug face!
He thinks his so rich and so Scottish, but I'm wearing a kilt, McDuck, a kilt!
Dah!
Lad!
I thought the traps would get you for sure!
Stupid upside-down temple!
Nothing cool about walking under buzzsaws!
From now on, don't touch anything!
Maybe Atlantis was an ambitious first outing.
Hi again, Granny!
Still at a friend's house.
Uh, her name?
Sub... ina!
A totally real name for a definitely real person!
Uh, good try.
Launchpad, are you okay?
Ah, a little snake venom never...
Hi, nice to meet you!
I'm everybody's friend!
Um, I've got to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back!
Whoa!
Suspension bridge?
Chasm?
Glowing blue mystical lasers?
Classic!
...Scrooge.
Wait till I get my hands on him.
Even a basic death trap still has the word "death" in the title.
Oh, no.
We'll find another route.
It's not safe for amateur adventurers.
That sounds like a challenge!
I have to stress that is not a challenge, is exactly what you say to dissuade the weak of heart from accepting the challenge!
Well, challenge accepted!

Aah!
Ugh, "lad."
I don't call you "old man" or "Scotty McTophat."
Respect your elder.
When you adventure with Scrooge McDuck...
But I'm not.
You want me to adventure behind Scrooge McDuck, or wait by the sub!
I might as well be back on the houseboat!
Because you have no idea what you're doing!
So show me!
Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!
I'm not lumping you all together.
Oh, really?
Which triplet am I?
It's...
Bluey?
Aah!
Ow!
Ugh!
Fantastic.
You see what I'm talking about?
You four find another way 'round!
We're going to... push onward, apparently.
Why, this is no bathroom!
This shortcuts leads right to the treasure chamber!
I don't even know why I hired the rest of you!
Help him up!
Ow.
Ouch!
Owie!
Owie!
Maybe I could just hire some family.
Then they'd have to listen to me.
There she is, the Jewel of Atlantis!
- Who's that?
- Flintheart Glomgold, the poor man's version of me, which, to be fair, still makes him insanely rich.
Load up the sub.
They've got Uncle Donald?
What?
Let go of my uncle!
- No.
- I wasn't prepared for that.
What are you doing here, Flinty?
What are you doing here, Scrooge?
I told you to keep the boys safe!
Ah, they're perfectly fine.
Oh, yeah?
Where are the other two?
Back safe in the room with the fire and the snakes.
- What?
- Ah, Scroogy.
I see you know my newest employee.
Your new job is with my sworn enemy?
I can't keep track of all your sworn enemies!
Now, now, Donald has been a model employee, and an excellent prisoner.
Yeah!
Wait, what?
Hiring my own nephew in order to use him against me?
Now, that is good planning.
Have fun being the second richest duck in the world... for the next five minutes.
I'd like to point out that this trap was not my fault.
Junior Woodchuck Rule 841:
There's always another way around.

Hup!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Oh, look!
Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.
We don't want to be rude, so... good-bye?
And you're done.
Yeah, you're never gonna be able to back up that lie.
That was crazy!
Whoa!
Oh, hej, Beakley!
Subina...
Take 'em down!
Ojda.
We gotta stop the water!
Oh, no.
I knew it!
I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!
Not the time, Donald.
Crazy old man!
All you care about is your next adventure.
This is the Spear of Selene all over again!
I was not responsible for the Spear of Selene!
Stop!
Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble, but I was so caught up in...
Why is there a lamp on the floor?
What?
Atlantis is upside down.
That means that lamp was supposed to be on the floor surrounded by all this treasure.
Attaboy, lad.
Keep going.
But why would you surround that thing with treasure unless...
That's the real Jewel of Atlantis!
That thing lit up when the trap was sprung.
I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!
Uncle Donald, you gotta let the room flood so I can grab the jewel.
That's crazy!
I'm supposed to, what, let go?
Trust you?
Well, yeah, that's kind of all you can do.
This is a surprisingly insightful death trap!
Hey!
We're gonna be okay!
Oh, yeah, those guys.
Huey and Louie!
Are doing okay!
Wait!
Where's Glomgold?
Hey, team.
Wanted to thank you for keeping Scrooge's kin busy while I escape with the jewel and blow up Atlantis with my most hated rival inside.
But I thought employees were greatest treasure of all!
Don't be ridiculous!
Treasure is the greatest treasure of all.
That's why it's called treasure!
Glomgold out!
We have to go!
- Huh?
- Mr. Duck.
Could we, um, maybe bum a ride with you?
That was some quick thinking.
You just may be an adventurer yet, Dewey.
Aye, aye.
Okay.
Settle down.
Ha ha!
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is with great pride that I, Flintheart Glomgold, present...
The Jewel of Atlantis!
What?
!
Is that Scrooge McDuck?
Mr. McDuck...
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.
Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?
That bauble?
That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
No, it's not!
Curse you, McDuck!
- Webby.
Uncle Hampus.
- How long?
Whole time.
Granny, I can explain.
Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.
- Now, Donald, don't...
- Stop.
I admit I'm a little overprotective.
A little?
!
No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.
- Uncle Donald?
- It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.
Sometimes, like birthdays or federal holidays.
Nothing too...
Ooh!
I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.
I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.
There you have it.
Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back, with family in tow, solving mysteries and rewriting history.
Easy.
A little to the left.
No, no, no, no!
Did I do it good?
Mom?

*DUCK TALES (2017)* Season 01 Episode 01 Title: "Woo-oo!"
Hey!
Eh!
Go!
(murmurs)
(thumping)
(clamor)
(sputtering)
Good morning, Uncle Donald.
You can't wear this to your job interview.
(sputtering) My uniform!
You gotta dress for the job you want, not the job you have, which is no job.
Wah!
Huey, don't touch the stove.
It's hot!
But it's a big day, and a big day calls for a big breakfast!
(deflating sound)
Bleh!
I'll get the iron.
Ouch!
Ooch.
(sputtering)
Stop helping me.
And put on your life vests!
What if the boat goes down while the babysitter's here?
BOTH:
Yes, Uncle Donald.
Where is that babysitter?
Where are you?
!
What?
I didn't give you a new address.
Well, what time can you get here?
I... don't know.
Crazy old bird.
Where can I find another babysitter at 10:00?
- 10:00?
!
- You gotta go!
Aah!
I can't just leave you!
We can survive for a couple of hours!
A couple of hours.
Uh... well, okay.
But just keep those life vests on!
(engine starts)
- Where's Dewey?
- Sleeping.
Who's Dewey?
Who's Dewey?
All right, boys, we'll getto Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone.
So long, Dorkburg!
Hello...
Uncle Donald?
What...
What's up?
I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!
You were supposed to get him out by 10:00, Hubert!
You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!
We never get to do anything!
Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat, we've all got to do things we don't want to do.
(beeps)
Destination:
McDuck Manor.
McDuck Manor?
As in Scrooge McDuck?
The bajillionaire?
You're finally gonna sell us.
I'm not gonna sell...
He owes me.
We're gonna meet Scrooge McDuck?
- That guy's amazing!
- What!
I heard he's so epic he defeated a rock giant and carved a statue of himself out of its legs!
I heard he's so smart he solved the mystery of the Chupacabra.
Turns out it was just a shaved bear!
I heard that he's so rich he only hunts for treasure to swim in it!
All right, take it down a notch.
It's only a couple of hours.
A couple of hours with the most exciting duck in the world!
With business expanding in the Spoonerville and St. Canard markets, noted in Appendices C, G and 5F, we're also cutting funding to unnecessary departments:
Historical Research, Experimental Tech,
Deep Sea Exploration...
Fantastic.
Back in the bin with ya.
See you tomorrow.
(sighs)
(clinks)
(grunting)
(tires squealing)
(barking)
Just another day at the office, eh, Mr. McD?
(laughs) Been there.
I don't have an office, per se, but in some ways the road is my office.
Hey, that's deep.
I gotta write that down.
(crash)
Geh!
Eyes on the road, McQuack!
Every dent is coming out of your salary.
Absolutely.
Hey, ya read about that crazy snowstorm on the Drake Barrier Reef?
I'd hate to fly into that one.
See, I'm a bit of a pilot, and, uh...
Oh, okay.
Divider... there you go.
Hit the brakes!
(tires squealing)
Ech.
Why aren't we moving?
Mrs. B., open up!
I need to get out of here before... (honking) he shows up.
Hey!
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, ya deadbeat!
Donald Duck.
Uncle Scrooge.
Uncle Scrooge!
(all jeering)
So, you're looking good.
Still living on that boat?
Yup.
Still a trillionaire?
(bird calls)
Good, good.
So...
So...
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, you deadbeat!
Oh, here we go!
Giving orders like he's the richest duck in the world!
I am the richest duck in the world!
- Now move!
- I would love to!
It just so happens I have a job interview.
So why are you standing there yelling?
Mrs. B. said that you would watch the boys!
Can you do that without losing them?
!
- Of course I can!
- Fantastic!
Thank you so much!
You're welcome!
Wait, what now?
(car door slams)
Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.
Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.
ALL:
Yes, Uncle Donald.
I wasn't talking to you.
Whoa!
Talk to your nephews.
Ew.
(startles)
So, do children still like marbles or...?
- Are you really our uncle?
- How old are you?
What's your net worth?
What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?
Is that fork real silver?
Can I have it?
- How come you never visit?
- 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?
You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.
You used to be a big deal!
Whatever happened to you?
Beakley!
Aah!
You agreed to watch them.
Watch them.
Huey, Louie, the third one...
Please do not leave the designated play area.
- (clinks)
- A gift from your great-uncle.
You will return them upon your departure.
He's counted them.
(lock clicks)
Great.
Now we've got two boring uncles.
So, we're totally ditching this room, right?
Yup, and I know just how to do it.
(gasps)
(grumbling)
"Used to be a big deal."
(beating)
Stupid doorknob, come off!
Nailed it!
Can't believe that was your best plan.
Come on, guys, let's go touch some expensive stuff.
- Aah!
- Dewey!
BOTH:
Aah!
Ah, ha ah!
I'll put the marbles back, I swear!
Who sent you?
Ma Beagle?
Glomgold?
Answer me!
(sobbing) Uncle Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge?
Oh, my gosh, the nephews!
- Wait, you know us?
- (grunting)
Of course!
Researching Mr. McDuck and his family is kind of my hobby.
- What?
- What are your blood types?
What's Donald really like?
Who's the evil triplet?
- Louie.
- Eh.
Tell me everything!
Um, we live with our uncle?
On a boat?
Go on.
Kinda it.
We're just a normal, boring family.
Normal, boring?
Hah!
ALL:
Ohh!
Whoa!
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side with Quackmore Duck twice removed!
And you are?
Oh, right.
Webby van der Quack.
My granny's the housekeeper.
Wait!
Are we...
friends now?
If we say yes, will you let us live?
(scoffs) Good one, new best friend!
So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?
Oh!
I'm the best at fun.
Um... yah!
At least it's not the marble room.
(grunting)
Come on, you blaggert.
You won't get the best of Scrooge McDuck!
Hmm.
A little spring cleaning?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Read this.
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.
First time in 50 years.
That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.
A shift in currents may present a pathway to Atlantis, lost city under the sea!
This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?
Nonsense!
I'm no has-been.
They're the has-beens.
I am an am-now.
Make a list!
Four oxygen tanks, two pressure gauges, a pilot...
- I'm a pilot.
- A week's provisions,
- an experimental deep-sea sub...
- I'm a pilot.
And one secretary for an old man who seems to have forgotten that I am not his secretary!
So, eh, not interested?
I have enough excitement caring for Webby.
Perhaps you should spend some time with your family.
Oh, hang up my spats, become the doddering old relic everyone thinks I am, spinning yarns to those loud-mouth young'uns about the man I used to be?
You have avoided them for ten years!
Because family is nothing but trouble!
(gasps) Oh.
I'm Scrooge McDuck.
I made my name being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.
And I made my money square, on my own, no nephews, no family, no one helped me there, and I don't need help now, and... (clattering)
Beakley, a little help.
Maybe they're right.
Whoo!
Vent crawl!
(both groan)
You don't get out much, do you?
Eh, Granny's a bit overprotective.
She trains me to be ready for anything, but then she says I've got everything I need in here.
But one day, I'm gonna see the world.
I'm gonna be an explorer!
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.
We could bring you a hamburger.
You really are my best friends.
Welcome to the Wing of Secrets!
I knew it!
Dewey, check it out!
Yeah, whatever.
The Gong of Picchu.
Hit it three times to unleash unspeakable evil.
Uh, what are you doing?
Calling dibs on stuff!
What?
Scrooge is, like, he's, like, super old.
Oh, careful!
Medusa gauntlet.
One touch can turn organic matter to stone.
(imitates solidifying)
I'm gonna call this one a maybe.
This place is incredible!
It's fake.
Is that Uncle Donald?
Oh, yeah, he was Mr. McDuck's sidekick!
- Dewey's right.
- Totally fake.
Uncle Donald has never done anything cool.
What?
Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!
(stuttering)
(phone rings)
(shiny ring)
Bop bop.
Bop.
Yo, chung chung!
Bop bop!
(exclaiming)
(yelling)
This has got to be a fake.
And I bet everything else is, too.
That's not true!
What about this picture with chupacabra?
- Photoshop.
- This treasure chest?
Probably bought it at an auction.
This... g-ghost?
You mean this Halloween decoration?
Curse ye, ye scurvy life-lubbers!
It's Captain Peghook, the scourge of the River Styx!
It's real.
It's really, really real!
(evil laughter)
The Deus Excalibur!
It won't rest until its target's slain!
But he's already dead!
(gong rings)
(gasps) Do not let anything else hit that gong!
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Whoa!
Aah!
- (whinnies)
(exclaims)
The headless man-horse!
That one feels self-explanatory.
(rings)
That's twice!
One more, and something terrible could happen!
What could be worse than this?
What in dismal downs is going on in here?
ALL:
There it is.
Why aren't you in your rooms?
(screaming)
Rrrawgh!
- Aah!
- (evil laughter)
(grunts)
(neighs)
We've got this.
There are four of us and three of them.
If we... wait, never mind.
They teamed up.
(evil laughter)
Ah, good, that means only one target.
No, get back!
You're old!
Oi, beastie!
What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?
The head of Scrooge McDuck!
(cracking)
Would you settle for his hat?
(roaring)
(groans)
(blade rings)
There's your head.
I should've been more specific!
(whinnies)
(celebrating)
(pounds)
We can explain.
We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?
Secret museum?
This is the gar-age!
The what?
Do you mean "garage"?
No, that's ridiculous.
If this is a garage, then how do you explain all this amazing stuff?
Like the garden hose of destiny?
Or Montezuma's stack of old magazines?
Or...
Oh, yeah, it's a garage.
Unbelievable.
I invite you into my home...
You locked us in a room!
I gave you marbles!
All we wanted was to hand out with you!
Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!
I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?
Everybody out!
- But we're...
- Out!
Well, what are you gaping at?
The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
(crackling)
Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...
Gold hunting?
Sounds great!
Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!
(sniffing)
Aah!
Me money bin!
To your rooms!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go eat a hamburger!
We're in!
Cool.
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.
The hamburger was a metaphor from before.
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
We get it.
But how are we gonna get up there?
I'm a pilot.
Ooh!
Yeah!
Ha ha!
It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal!
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Ugh!
It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!
Take that!
Nooooooooooo!
(straining)
Whoo-hoo!
I thought I told you to go to your...
No time.
We gotta work fast.
Webby, how do we stop it?
It's mystical, so we need a mystical device, like an oblivion mirror or a medusa gauntlet, or...
- Like this?
- Grr.
What?
I was gonna give it back.
Now, how do we get him down there?
Garden hose of destiny!
Launchpad, we need to swing him out.
Nosedive towards the bin and get ready to pull up!
Yes, sir, random kid I just met!
Any questions?
-Since when is Launchpad a pilot?
(clinks)
You guys, our family is awesome!
ALL:
Scrooge!
(gasping)
(cheering)
NEPHEW:
Money!
I knew it!
Aw.
Family truly is the greatest adventure of...
Oh, no, the ground!
(crashing)
In the short time I've known you, you've wrecked my home and my money bin, unleashed several ancient evils, and almost don't be killed twice
Four times if you count each monster as an individual time... (laughter)
That was incredible!
When you pulled me into the airplane and said "No time!"
And who would have thought of a Medusa Gauntlet?
!
Brilliant!
Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and (laughter)
You kids are nothing but trouble!
Curse me kilts, have I missed trouble!
I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.
- (phone ringing)
- You mean...?
Beakley!
Clear my schedule!
I'm taking the wee ones on a field trip.
About time.
And once again, I am not your secre...
Now, let's go find the lost city of Atlantis!
ALL:
Yeah!
And no one tell your uncle Donald!
ALL:
Yeah!
Who is that?
(struggling)
You've got the job, Duck!
Seriously?
Oh, boy!
I'm a real accountant!
Accountant?
That was filled yesterday.
You're our new sailor!

Duck?
Ha!
Now remember, bedtime is at 9:00.
And no sugar after 7:00.
Oh, and...
I run a multi-trillion dollar business.
I can handle a few juveniles for the weekend.
You just focus on this new job of yours.
Besides, we've got a pretty low-key day planned.
Hoist the mainsail!
Other boat words, to Atlantis!
Dive!
Dive!
- No, no, wait!
- Aye aye!
Launchpad, the hatch.
Stop the...
Whoo-hoo!
Talk to your uncle.
Hey, Uncle Donald.
Nope, yeah, pretty boring.
We napped, rubbed ointment on our joints, old people stuff.
Oh, what about the dragon?
And the plane crash?
And...
Whoops, 3:00 pm.
Time for dinner.
Bye!
Why didn't you tell him the truth?
You didn't tell your grandma we were going to a dangerous underwater city, did you?
I kinda sorta...
didn't tell her anything?
Webby, that's irresponsible!
She'll be worried sick!
Call your grandma this instant and tell her that you are spending the night at a friend's house, okay?
Lying: it's the responsible thing to do.
Launchpad, have you ever piloted a sub before?
I sunk a helicopter in a wave pool once.
- Same thing?
- I've done more with less.
No matter, I'm back!
Unchartered territory.
Bold new discoveries!
Hello, bingo!
I love road trips!
I've got snacks, a playlist of traditional sea chanties, matching family road trip shirts!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but there's no time.
But according to the travel itinerary...
-Boo!
Adventure isn't about planning, it's about doing!
So, what can I be in charge of?
- The buzzsaw arm?
- No!
- Sonic cannons?
- No!
Hyper-dense zero-point energy missiles to pierce the scaly hide of a Kraken?
!
None of those things are real things!
This is your first expedition, so just stand back and watch an old pro from a safe distance.
So what is this submarine equipped with?
(whirs)
Seatbelts.
(laughing)
Ha!
Good one.
Classic Scrooge-Dewey banter, the seasoned-but-tired explorer passing the torch to his cocky young successor.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually know our names.
- I'm sorry, what?
- I think he called me her board ones.
Don't be ridiculous!
Hey, Scrooge!
When are we gonna set sail, Scrooge?
In a moment, Sonny Jim.
I will cram it down your throat.
Guys, lighten up!
We're on a deep-sea expedition with Scrooge McDuck!
Mr. McQuack, chart a course.

You got this.
[Rapidly] Hi, Granny, I'm spending the night at a friend's house so nothing is wrong!
Oh, you don't got this.
Ah-ha!
Well, according to these markings, the Atlantines were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!
You kids best stay by the sub while I scout ahead.
Dewey ran in as soon as you said "death traps."

I might as well be back on the houseboat!
Because you have no idea what you're doing!
So show me!
Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!
I'm not lumping you all together.
Oh, really?
Which triplet am I?
It's...
Bluey?
Aah!
Ow!
Ugh!
Fantastic.
You see what I'm talking about?
You four find another way 'round!
We're going to... push onward, apparently.
[Grunting]
[Sighs]
Why, this is no bathroom!
This shortcuts leads right to the treasure chamber!
I don't even know why I hired the rest of you!
Help him up!
Ow.
Ouch!
Owie!
Owie!
Maybe I could just hire some family.
Then they'd have to listen to me.
[Laughs] There she is, the Jewel of Atlantis!
[Cackling]
- Who's that?
- Flintheart Glomgold, the poor man's version of me, which, to be fair, still makes him insanely rich.
[Cackling]
Load up the sub.
They've got Uncle Donald?
What?
Let go of my uncle!
- No.
- I wasn't prepared for that.
What are you doing here, Flinty?
What are you doing here, Scrooge?
I told you to keep the boys safe!
Ah, they're perfectly fine.
Oh, yeah?
Where are the other two?
Back safe in the room with the fire and the snakes.
- What?
- Ah, Scroogy.
I see you know my newest employee.
Your new job is with my sworn enemy?
I can't keep track of all your sworn enemies!
Now, now, Donald has been a model employee, and an excellent prisoner.
Yeah!
Wait, what?
Hiring my own nephew in order to use him against me?
Now, that is good planning.
Have fun being the second richest duck in the world... for the next five minutes.
[Cackling]
I'd like to point out that this trap was not my fault.
Junior Woodchuck Rule 841:
There's always another way around.
Hup!
- [Ringing]
- Hup!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Oh, look!
Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.
We don't want to be rude, so... good-bye?
And you're done.
Yeah, you're never gonna be able to back up that lie.
That was crazy!
Whoa!
Oh, hej, Beakley!
Subina... [Speaking Swedish]
[Glomgold Cackling]
Take 'em down!
Ojda.
We gotta stop the water!
[Quacking]
Oh, no.
[Sighs] I knew it!
I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!
Not the time, Donald.
Crazy old man!
All you care about is your next adventure.
This is the Spear of Selene all over again!
I was not responsible for the Spear of Selene!
Stop!
Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble, but I was so caught up in...
Why is there a lamp on the floor?
What?
Atlantis is upside down.
That means that lamp was supposed to be on the floor surrounded by all this treasure.
Attaboy, lad.
Keep going.
But why would you surround that thing with treasure unless...
BOTH:
That's the real Jewel of Atlantis!
That thing lit up when the trap was sprung.
I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!
Uncle Donald, you gotta let the room flood so I can grab the jewel.
That's crazy!
I'm supposed to, what, let go?
Trust you?
Well, yeah, that's kind of all you can do.
This is a surprisingly insightful death trap!
[Quacks]
[Grunting]
[Panting]
Hey!
We're gonna be okay!
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
Oh, yeah, those guys.
Huey and Louie!
Are doing okay!
[Grunting]
Wait!
Where's Glomgold?
[Walkie-Talkie Crackles]
GLOMGOLD:
Hey, team.
Wanted to thank you for keeping Scrooge's kin busy while I escape with the jewel and blow up Atlantis with my most hated rival inside.
But I thought employees were greatest treasure of all!
Don't be ridiculous!
Treasure is the greatest treasure of all.
That's why it's called treasure!
Glomgold out!
We have to go!
- Huh?
- Mr. Duck.
Could we, um, maybe bum a ride with you?
That was some quick thinking.
You just may be an adventurer yet, Dewey.
[Reporters Clamoring]
Aye, aye.
Okay.
Settle down.
Ha ha!
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is with great pride that I, Flintheart Glomgold, present...
The Jewel of Atlantis!
What?
!
Is that Scrooge McDuck?
- Mr. McDuck...
- [Clamor Resumes]
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.
Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?
That bauble?
That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
No, it's not!
[Splashing]
[Roaring]
[Screams] Curse you, McDuck!
- Webby.
Uncle Hampus.
- How long?
Whole time.
Granny, I can explain.
Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.
- Now, Donald, don't...
- Stop.
I admit I'm a little overprotective.
LOUIE:
A little?
!
No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.
- Uncle Donald?
- It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.
[Cheering]
Sometimes, like birthdays or federal holidays.
- Nothing too...
- [Bang]
Ooh!
I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.
I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.
[Chuckles]
[Cheering]
There you have it.
Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back, with family in tow, solving mysteries and rewriting history.

Good morning, Uncle Donald.
You can't wear this to your job interview.
[Sputtering] My uniform!
You gotta dress for the job you want, not the job you have, which is no job.
Wah!
Huey, don't touch the stove.
It's hot!
But it's a big day, and a big day calls for a big breakfast!
[Deflating Sound]
Bleh!
I'll get the iron.
Ouch!
Ooch.

Stop helping me.
And put on your life vests!
What if the boat goes down while the babysitter's here?
BOTH:
Yes, Uncle Donald.
Where is that babysitter?
Where are you?
!
What?
I didn't give you a new address.
Well, what time can you get here?
I... don't know.
Crazy old bird.
Where can I find another babysitter at 10:00?
- 10:00?

- You gotta go!
Aah!
I can't just leave you!
We can survive for a couple of hours!
A couple of hours.
Uh... well, okay.
But just keep those life vests on!
[Engine Starts]
Where's Dewey?
- Sleeping.
- Who's Dewey?
Who's Dewey?
All right, boys, we'll get to Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone.
So long, Dorkburg!
Hello...
Uncle Donald?
What...
What's up?
I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!
You were supposed to get him out by 10:00, Hubert!
You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!
We never get to do anything!
Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat, we've all got to do things we don't want to do.
[Beeps]
Destination:
McDuck Manor.
McDuck Manor?
As in Scrooge McDuck?
The bajillionaire?
You're finally gonna sell us.
I'm not gonna sell...
He owes me.
We're gonna meet Scrooge McDuck?
- That guy's amazing!
- What!
I heard he's so epic he defeated a rock giant and carved a statue of himself out of its legs!
I heard he's so smart he solved the mystery of the chupacabra.
Turns out it was just a shaved bear!
I heard that he's so rich he only hunts for treasure to swim in it!
All right, take it down a notch.
It's only a couple of hours.
A couple of hours with the most exciting duck in the world!

Eyes on the road, McQuack!
Every dent is coming out of your salary.
Absolutely.

I am the richest duck in the world!
Now move!
I would love to!
It just so happens I have a job interview.
So why are you standing there yelling?
Mrs. B. said that you would watch the boys!
Can you do that without losing them?

- Of course I can!
- Fantastic!
Thank you so much!
You're welcome!
Wait, what now?
[Car Door Slams]
Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.
Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.
ALL:
Yes, Uncle Donald.
I wasn't talking to you.
Whoa!
Talk to your nephews.
Ew.
[Startles]
So, do children still like marbles or...?
Are you really our uncle?
- How old are you?
- What's your net worth?
What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?
Is that fork real silver?
Can I have it?
- How come you never visit?
- 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?
You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.
You used to be a big deal!
Whatever happened to you?
Beakley!
Aah!
You agreed to watch them.
Watch them.
Huey, Louie, the third one...
Please do not leave the designated play area.
- [Clinks]
- A gift from your great-uncle.
You will return them upon your departure.
He's counted them.
[Lock Clicks]
Great.
Now we've got two boring uncles.
So, we're totally ditching this room, right?
Yup, and I know just how to do it.
[Gasps]
[Grumbling]
"Used to be a big deal."
[Beating]
Stupid doorknob, come off!
Nailed it!
Can't believe that was your best plan.
Come on, guys, let's go touch some expensive stuff.
- Aah!
- Dewey!
BOTH:
Aah!
I'll put the marbles back, I swear!
Who sent you?
Ma Beagle?
Glomgold?
Answer me!
[Sobbing] Uncle Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge?
Oh, my gosh, the nephews!
- Wait, you know us?
- [Grunting]
Of course!
Researching Mr. McDuck and his family is kind of my hobby.
- What?
- What are your blood types?
What's Donald really like?
Who's the evil triplet?
- Louie.
- Eh.
Tell me everything!
Um, we live with our uncle?
On a boat?
Go on.
Kinda it.
We're just a normal, boring family.
Normal, boring?
Hah!
ALL:
Ohh!
Whoa!
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side with Quackmore Duck twice removed!
And you are?
Oh, right.
Webby van der Quack.
My granny's the housekeeper.
Wait!
Are we... friends now?
If we say yes, will you let us live?
[Scoffs] Good one, new best friend!
So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?
Oh!
I'm the best at fun.
Um... yah!
At least it's not the marble room.
[Grunting]
Come on, you blaggert.
You won't get the best of Scrooge McDuck!
Hmm.
A little spring cleaning?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Read this.
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.
First time in 50 years.
That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.
A shift in currents may present a pathway to Atlantis, lost city under the sea!
This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?
Nonsense!
I'm no has-been.
They're the has-beens.
I am an am-now.
Make a list!
Four oxygen tanks, two pressure gauges, a pilot...
- I'm a pilot.
- A week's provisions,
- an experimental deep-sea sub...
- I'm a pilot.
And one secretary for an old man who seems to have forgotten that I am not his secretary!
So, eh, not interested?
I have enough excitement caring for Webby.
Perhaps you should spend some time with your family.
Oh, hang up my spats, become the doddering old relic everyone thinks I am, spinning yarns to those loud-mouth young'uns about the man I used to be?
You have avoided them for ten years!
Because family is nothing but trouble!
[Gasps] Oh.
I'm Scrooge McDuck.
I made my name being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.
And I made my money square, on my own, no nephews, no family, no one helped me there, and I don't need help now, and...
[Clattering]
Beakley, a little help.
Maybe they're right.
Whoo!
Vent crawl!
[Both Groan]
You don't get out much, do you?
Eh, Granny's a bit overprotective.
She trains me to be ready for anything, but then she says I've got everything I need in here.
But one day, I'm gonna see the world.
I'm gonna be an explorer!
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.
We could bring you a hamburger.
You really are my best friends.
Welcome to the Wing of Secrets!
I knew it!
Dewey, check it out!
Yeah, whatever.
The Gong of Picchu.
Hit it three times to unleash unspeakable evil.
Uh, what are you doing?
Calling dibs on stuff!
What?
Scrooge is, like, he's, like, super old.
Oh, careful!
Medusa gauntlet.
One touch can turn organic matter to stone.
[Imitates Solidifying]
I'm gonna call this one a maybe.
This place is incredible!
It's fake.
Is that Uncle Donald?
Oh, yeah, he was Mr. McDuck's sidekick!
- Dewey's right.
- Totally fake.
Uncle Donald has never done anything cool.
What?
Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!

- This treasure chest?
Probably bought it at an auction.
This... g-ghost?
You mean this Halloween decoration?
Curse ye, ye scurvy life-lubbers!
It's Captain Peghook, the scourge of the River Styx!
It's real.
It's really, really real!
[Evil Laughter]
The Deus Excalibur!
It won't rest until its target's slain!
But he's already dead!

[Gasps] Do not let anything else hit that gong!
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Whoa!
Aah!
- [Whinnies]
[Exclaims]
The headless man-horse!
That one feels self-explanatory.
[Rings]
That's twice!
One more, and something terrible could happen!
What could be worse than this?
What in dismal downs is going on in here?

There it is.
Why aren't you in your rooms?
[Screaming]
Rrrawgh!
- Aah!

There are four of us and three of them.
If we... wait, never mind.
They teamed up.
[Evil Laughter]
Ah, good, that means only one target.
No, get back!
You're old!
Oi, beastie!
What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?
The head of Scrooge McDuck!

Would you settle for his hat?
[Roaring]
[Groans]
[Blade Rings]
There's your head.
I should've been more specific!

We can explain.
We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?
Secret museum?
This is the gar-age!
The what?
Do you mean "garage"?
No, that's ridiculous.
If this is a garage, then how do you explain all this amazing stuff?
Like the garden hose of destiny?
Or Montezuma's stack of old magazines?
Or...
Oh, yeah, it's a garage.
Unbelievable.
I invite you into my home...
You locked us in a room!
I gave you marbles!
All we wanted was to hand out with you!
Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!
I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?
Everybody out!
- But we're...
- Out!
Well, what are you gaping at?
The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
[Crackling]
Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...
Gold hunting?
Sounds great!
Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!
[Sniffing]
Aah!
Me money bin!
To your rooms!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go eat a hamburger!
We're in!
Cool.
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.
The hamburger was a metaphor from before.
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
We get it.
But how are we gonna get up there?
I'm a pilot.
Ooh!
Yeah!
Ha ha!
It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal!
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Ugh!
It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!
Take that!
No!
[Straining]
Whoo-hoo!
I thought I told you to go to your...
No time.
We gotta work fast.
Webby, how do we stop it?
It's mystical, so we need a mystical device, like an oblivion mirror or a medusa gauntlet, or...
- Like this?
- Grr.
What?
I was gonna give it back.
Now, how do we get him down there?
Garden hose of destiny!
Launchpad, we need to swing him out.
Nosedive towards the bin and get ready to pull up!
Yes, sir, random kid I just met!
- Any questions?
- Since when is Launchpad a pilot?

Four times if you count each monster as an individual time...

That was incredible!
When you pulled me into the airplane and said "No time!"
And who would have thought of a Medusa Gauntlet?

Brilliant!
Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and [Laughter]
You kids are nothing but trouble!
Curse me kilts, have I missed trouble!

Why didn't you tell him the truth?
You didn't tell your grandma we were going to a dangerous underwater city, did you?
I kinda sorta... didn't tell her anything?
Webby, that's irresponsible!

Call your grandma this instant and tell her that you are spending the night at a friend's house, okay?

Whoa!
Just call your grandma already!
It's no big deal.
[Dialing]
Aah!
Remember, you're at a friend's house, okay?
You got this.
[Rapidly] Hi, Granny, I'm spending the night at a friend's house so nothing is wrong!
Oh, you don't got this.
Ah-ha!
Well, according to these markings, the Atlantines were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!
You kids best stay by the sub while I scout ahead.
Dewey ran in as soon as you said "death traps."
DEWEY:
Come on, Scrooge!
We got this.
Boy!
[Sighs, Mutters]
- [Blade Rings] - [Donald Squawks]
Oopsie!
[Grunts]
Hmm?
Meh.
You made me miss!
Uh... if we get rid of them now, we can't torture them later!
Brilliant!
I want Scrooge alive when I shove the Jewel of Atlantis in his smug face!
He thinks his so rich and so Scottish, but I'm wearing a kilt, McDuck, a kilt!
Dah!
Lad!
I thought the traps would get you for sure!
[Whirring]
Stupid upside-down temple!
Nothing cool about walking under buzzsaws!
From now on, don't touch anything!
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
[Cracks Spine]
Maybe Atlantis was an ambitious first outing.
[Ringing]
[Grunting]
Hi again, Granny!
Still at a friend's house.
Uh, her name?
Sub... ina!
A totally real name for a definitely real person!
[Beep]
Uh, good try.
- [Grunts]
- Launchpad, are you okay?
[Mumbling]
Ah, a little snake venom never... [Gibbering]
Hi, nice to meet you!
I'm everybody's friend!
[Screaming]
Um, I've got to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back!
[Groaning]
[Grunts]
Whoa!
Suspension bridge?
Chasm?
Glowing blue mystical lasers?
Classic!
[Muttering] ...
Scrooge.
Wait till I get my hands on him.
Even a basic death trap still has the word "death" in the title.
[Squawking]
Oh, no.
We'll find another route.
It's not safe for amateur adventurers.
That sounds like a challenge!
I have to stress that is not a challenge.
Is exactly what you say to dissuade the weak of heart from accepting the challenge!
Well, challenge accepted!
There's no challenge!
Dewey!
♪ Dew... ♪
[Screaming]
♪ Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey ♪
Huh?
Aah!
♪ Dew, uh, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey ♪
[Quacks, Screams]
♪ Dew ♪
Oh, no!
♪ How does he Dewey it?
♪
♪ I don't know ♪
[Riffing]
[Quacking]
♪ Dew!
And now you know ♪
Nailed it!
Sure, if you want to do it the easy way.
Why wouldn't you want to do it the easy way?
You've got to work smarter, lad, not harder.
Aah!
Ugh, "lad."
I don't call you "old man" or "Scotty McTophat."
Respect your elder.
When you adventure with Scrooge McDuck...
But I'm not.
You want me to adventure behind Scrooge McDuck, or wait by the sub!
I might as well be back on the houseboat!
Because you have no idea what you're doing!
So show me!
Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!
I'm not lumping you all together.
Oh, really?
Which triplet am I?
It's...
Bluey?
Aah!
Ow!
Ugh!
Fantastic.
You see what I'm talking about?
You four find another way 'round!
We're going to... push onward, apparently.
[Grunting]
[Sighs]
Why, this is no bathroom!
This shortcuts leads right to the treasure chamber!
I don't even know why I hired the rest of you!
Help him up!
Ow.
Ouch!
Owie!
Owie!
Maybe I could just hire some family.
Then they'd have to listen to me.
[Laughs] There she is, the Jewel of Atlantis!
[Cackling]
- Who's that?
- Flintheart Glomgold, the poor man's version of me, which, to be fair, still makes him insanely rich.
[Cackling]
Load up the sub.
They've got Uncle Donald?
What?
Let go of my uncle!
- No.
- I wasn't prepared for that.
What are you doing here, Flinty?
What are you doing here, Scrooge?
I told you to keep the boys safe!
Ah, they're perfectly fine.
Oh, yeah?
Where are the other two?
Back safe in the room with the fire and the snakes.
- What?
- Ah, Scroogy.
I see you know my newest employee.
Your new job is with my sworn enemy?
I can't keep track of all your sworn enemies!
Now, now, Donald has been a model employee, and an excellent prisoner.
Yeah!
Wait, what?
Hiring my own nephew in order to use him against me?
Now, that is good planning.
Have fun being the second richest duck in the world... for the next five minutes.
[Cackling]
I'd like to point out that this trap was not my fault.
Junior Woodchuck Rule 841:
There's always another way around.
Hup!
- [Ringing]
- Hup!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Oh, look!
Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.
We don't want to be rude, so... good-bye?
And you're done.
Yeah, you're never gonna be able to back up that lie.
That was crazy!
Whoa!
Oh, hej, Beakley!
Subina... [Speaking Swedish]
[Glomgold Cackling]
Take 'em down!
Ojda.
We gotta stop the water!
[Quacking]
Oh, no.
[Sighs] I knew it!
I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!
Not the time, Donald.
Crazy old man!
All you care about is your next adventure.
This is the Spear of Selene all over again!
I was not responsible for the Spear of Selene!
Stop!
Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble, but I was so caught up in...
Why is there a lamp on the floor?
What?
Atlantis is upside down.
That means that lamp was supposed to be on the floor surrounded by all this treasure.
Attaboy, lad.
Keep going.
But why would you surround that thing with treasure unless...
BOTH:
That's the real Jewel of Atlantis!
That thing lit up when the trap was sprung.
I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!
Uncle Donald, you gotta let the room flood so I can grab the jewel.
That's crazy!
I'm supposed to, what, let go?
Trust you?
Well, yeah, that's kind of all you can do.
This is a surprisingly insightful death trap!
[Quacks]
[Grunting]
[Panting]
Hey!
We're gonna be okay!
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
Oh, yeah, those guys.
Huey and Louie!
Are doing okay!
[Grunting]
Wait!
Where's Glomgold?
[Walkie-Talkie Crackles]
GLOMGOLD:
Hey, team.
Wanted to thank you for keeping Scrooge's kin busy while I escape with the jewel and blow up Atlantis with my most hated rival inside.
But I thought employees were greatest treasure of all!
Don't be ridiculous!
Treasure is the greatest treasure of all.
That's why it's called treasure!
Glomgold out!
We have to go!
- Huh?
- Mr. Duck.
Could we, um, maybe bum a ride with you?
That was some quick thinking.
You just may be an adventurer yet, Dewey.
[Reporters Clamoring]
Aye, aye.
Okay.
Settle down.
Ha ha!
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is with great pride that I, Flintheart Glomgold, present...
The Jewel of Atlantis!
What?
!
Is that Scrooge McDuck?
- Mr. McDuck...
- [Clamor Resumes]
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.
Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?
That bauble?
That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.
No, it's not!
[Splashing]
[Roaring]
[Screams] Curse you, McDuck!
- Webby.
Uncle Hampus.
- How long?
Whole time.
Granny, I can explain.
Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.
- Now, Donald, don't...
- Stop.
I admit I'm a little overprotective.
LOUIE:
A little?
!
No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.
Uncle Donald?
It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.
[Cheering]
Sometimes, like birthdays or federal holidays.
- Nothing too...
- [Bang]
Ooh!
I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.
I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.
[Chuckles]
[Cheering]
There you have it.
Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back, with family in tow, solving mysteries and rewriting history.
DONALD:
Easy.
A little to the left.
No, no, no, no!
Did I do it good?
[Laughter]
[Screams]
Mom?
[Panting]
Take that!
[Laughing]
Dewey, don't yell at your target before you fire.
You'll lose the element of surprise.
- You'd better duck.
- [Yelling]
- Ahh!
[Grunts] - [Laughter]
"DuckTales," All new Saturday, September 23 anywhere you watch Disney XD.
Fixed Synced by bozxphd.
Enjoy The Flick.
Stop.
What?
Someone's coming.
Shit.
Who is it?
Beats me, I can't see anything.
This is freaking me out, Adam, you said that no one ever comes up here.
Are you okay, ma'am?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, officer.
I suppose you gave us a bit of a scare.
There's no parking here after sundown.
Sorry, officer.
You been drinking, son?
Mama said never to drink on a first date.
First date, very nice.
All right.
You kids get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, officer.
Sorry, officer.
Oh, boy, what a drag.
You are so lucky he didn't bust you for drinking.
Yeah, he had no right.
Besides, only park rangers can ticket you in these parts.
You are so full of it.
Come on.
This guy is just dying to give us a ticket.
What the hell is he doing?
God damn.
No, Adam.
You're such an idiot!
Officer, I don't know what you think I was doing, but...
Hey, you're not the...
What the hell is that?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, mister, I'm talking to you!
No, Adam!
Please, no, we didn't do anything wrong!
Run, Lula!
Run!
Help!
Help!
Hey, honey, I'm home.
Hey.
Hey.
What did you do with the, uh, grocery money?
And how was your day?
Let me tell you a little bit about mine.
It was great.
You want one?
Where'd it all go?
To our future.
Harvey won us the bid on that storage locker.
Oh, god, another one?
You know, it's your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your future, Zoe.
What?
That's a quote by your Anthony Robbins.
You didn't even read that book.
Maybe a little.
Oh, my god.
Baby, we got that riding mower, remember?
We sold that for a good buck, and then what about that storage locker with all that silverware?
We made out like bandits on that.
Mick, that's two, what about all the other ones?
Oh, lord Jesus.
Okay, what did you end up paying for this one?
1,200 what?
$1,200?
Yeah.
Mick, that's three months' rent.
Harv and I split it, so...
I'm gonna kill you right now.
I'm mad at you, we can't...
Mick, we're never gonna get out of this shitbox betting on storage lockers.
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
I mean... oh, god.
It's not what I'm saying, it's what you're saying.
You sit there, and you sit there, and go,
"oh, Zoe, I wanna give you a better life."
"Oh, Zoe, I wanna actually give you a real house one day."
But I'm the only grown-up standing here in the room, and I don't wanna be the grown-up.
Don't even, don't even.
No, no, no, no, no, just...
What?
This is your special spot, your special spot.
I hate you so much right now.
What do we own now?
Well, let's go talk to Harvey, and check it out, right?
You're so rotten.
Stop it.
Get outta here.
Come on, babe.
So, Tina, she was the one who tipped us off.
She said it was owned by some rich old woman.
And I ain't talking like, living in a trailer with a caddy in the driveway kind of rich,
I'm talking more like real housewives of Atlanta kind of rich.
Baby, we got to take this thing in before it completely craps out on us, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Just as soon as we can pay for it.
Cut me some slack.
I didn't say anything!
I'm just trying to dig us out of this rut.
Do you have a bulldozer?
Pfft.
Man, you know I'm ain't programed to take shit from nobody.
It ain't in my genes.
Is having a roof over your head in your genes?
How much money do you think you've actually made on these lockers over the past two years?
I don't know, a little over $1,000.
So, you just threw most of that back today on one locker.
That's all I'm saying.
My sister's got it better than us, and she's in jail.
Hot damn, you serious?
I got a good feeling about this one, okay?
Oh, baby, you always do.
I got a good feeling about this one.
You always do.
Come on, get in here.
Jesus, Harvey.
You look like shit.
Diggity.
Hot diggity.
Aw, now, there's a ray of sunshine.
Where have you been?
Oh, hey, Harvey.
Hey, you know what?
You get prettier and prettier every time I see ya.
Don't try to sweet talk me, where's all the crap you guys bought?
It's that pile right there.
Hey, you want a beer?
Sure.
Man, you look like you haven't slept.
Wow!
I haven't.
So, this is it?
Yeah, well, those are the best pieces.
That's, uh, like, I don't know, Thirty bucks, and we got some stuff back in the locker, $100, $120.
So, we're talking $400, $425 for the whole lot.
$425 for the whole thing?
Whoo!
Hold on, hold on.
Tina's never steered us wrong before.
Well, honey, looks like you guys got screwed like a 10-cent whore on nickel night.
No, no, no.
I was going through those boxes there, and I found something.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Follow me.
It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser.
Come here, check this out.
Home movies?
They're dated.
09-27-69.
Oh, great, so, now you're the proud owners of somebody's 40-year-old wedding movies.
No, not a wedding.
I watched them.
Follow me.
Up here.
Go in straight, and then to your right.
Oh, real classy, Harv.
Don't fucking touch that.
That's collector's edition.
How do you keep inventory of all this crap?
Oh, Christ, Harvey.
I got a photographic memory.
I think you have a concussion right about now.
Hey, let's watch some movies!
What do you keep in here, a dead body?
Oh, Jesus.
You okay?
Can we just go?
Yeah, let's, uh...
Harv?
Harvey?
Harvey?
Here.
Okay, so, home movies.
I really hope this gets better, Harv.
Just keep watching.
Shit.
What happened?
Uh, this film, it's just really old and degraded.
It's okay, I saw it.
Is it ruined?
What was it?
Can you just hold your panties?
I'll hold my panties.
I'm just gonna put in the second reel.
Just have some Patience.
Here we go.
This one's hard to watch.
Whoa!
What the hell is this, Harv?
It's the zodiac.
Zodiac?
Yeah, that's why I stayed up all night researching this shit.
This guy claims to have killed 37 people.
Only, the cops confirmed five.
Holy shit.
Here.
He taunted the police with letters containing ciphers that to this day have gone unsolved.
Not even the FBI have been able to solve them.
There he is.
That's our guy in the film.
Jesus Christ.
I've seen that picture before.
The numbers on these cans.
09-27-69.
Punch that in, babe.
"Napa, California.
Cecelia Shepard attacked on..."
"September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of lake Berryessa.
"Shepard died of her wounds."
See, what'd I tell ya?
What are the other dates on those?
06-18-68.
06-18-68.
Nothing.
All right.
Try 08-31-68.
08-31-68.
- Nope.
- Search "murders."
He was never caught.
The search for the zodiac killer has been like the search for the fucking holy grail.
Here you go.
Okay.
First of all, you don't even know if those are real, and second, you should let the police handle this.
That's what I would do.
How is any of this stuff in an old lady's locker?
Maybe it wasn't an old lady's locker.
Mick, think about it, you'd never store evidence like this in your own name, right?
Well...
"San Francisco police department re-opens zodiac case."
Which is exactly why you call the police.
No, no, you're not looking close enough.
Look where it says, "reward for evidence leading to the zodiac killer."
$100,000.
Boo-yah!
Divine intervention.
Come on, baby.
This could be my ticket to Costa Rica.
You guys are nuts.
Zoe, there are a million theories on the Internet that the zodiac filmed his kills.
I've seen my fair share of America's most wanted.
This is not enough evidence to prove anything.
No, you're absolutely right.
All we have to do is find out who they belong to, and then we have something worth 100,000 fucking dollars.
Hey, Mick?
I gotta go, I gotta go do, um, Ellie's hair.
I'll be in the vehicle.
She'll be fine.
She's been this way since Freda closed the salon.
Are you sure we can make some money off this thing?
I don't know, man, but I do know that that's the guy on the film.
Here.
You take it, you put it in a safe place because these could be our meal tickets.
We go 50-50, you want to do this with me.
Come on, man.
We already know where the first stop is, right?
Fifty-fifty.
Fiddy-fiddy.
$50,000 each.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
Evening, ray.
Good night, ray.
Baby.
Come on, come to bed.
We can talk about this tomorrow.
Um, there's nothing to talk about.
It's a lot of money.
Do you hear yourself, Mick?
Because you are talking, um, about a serial killer, so...
I know.
Good.
So, there's nothing to talk about.
Baby, I get a vote in this, too.
We are talking about $100,000.
Mick, I let you convince me to move to this shitty town.
Oh...
I let you convince me to sell my mama's jewelry to pay rent and pay the bills...
Hey, hey, what'd you want me to do?
You were out of work.
That's not fair because I am doing my part in this, okay?
I did Ellie today, I have somebody tomorrow...
And that helps, but, baby, I am not making shit mowing lawns and throwing out trash.
So, your solution is hunting a serial killer for a reward?
It's $100,000.
Good night.
Hey, baby.
You left without saying goodbye.
I know, you were sleeping and I didn't want to wake you.
Look, Mick, I don't want to fight with you.
Neither do I.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but, um... oh, lord Jesus.
If you honestly think this thing is legit, then let's do it.
Are you sure you're up for this?
No, but that's real money, and we're running out of options.
This could be the one we're been waiting for, baby.
I hope so.
All right, let me check back in with Harvey then.
Great, love you.
Love you, too.
All right.
This is Tina.
Uh-huh.
Tina, why'd you change the lock on my locker?
I gotta get in there...
I've heard it all before, honey.
Just come by the office tomorrow and make a partial payment, okay?
All right.
All right.
Oh, jeez.
All right, Harv, we're in.
You mean Zoe said yes?
Oh, shut up, and let's just get to work.
Shut up, Harvey.
What is that smell?
Yes, this is perchlorethylene.
It's like a pedicure for this old film.
It, like, pulls off any sludge and restores moisture.
Yeah, so, it won't burn up again.
Huh.
Well, aren't you a trick.
You should give me your reel, so I can clean it up.
Oh, our reel is doing just fine, Harv.
Well, I hope you have it hid good 'cause it's half the key to our fortune.
We heard you the first time, Harv.
It's taken care of.
We're gonna talk to Tina at the u-store-all.
Yep.
And find out who actually rented this locker.
Oh, good idea.
Now, I wanna see the rest of that crap we bought.
All right.
Which one is it?
This one right here.
What the hell?
Where's all the crap?
I sure as hell hope Tina moved it.
Ugh!
What the hell?
Ugh...
She's always here.
Tina, it's Mick.
Where are you?
I need to get some things.
Call me back asap, huh?
Yeah, I don't get this.
She's always here.
Honey, I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure she just ran out to get a bite to eat or something.
God damn it.
Jeez.
What, are you gonna go in, guns-a-blazing?
Break in the joint?
I don't know, maybe just have a look around.
Oh, no, oh.
Oh, my god.
This is a very bad idea.
Get down.
Okay, this is perfect.
Okay.
Okay, what are we doing?
This is the locker number.
I want you to check the computer, I'll check the filing cabinets.
You realize that you seem oddly comfortable with all of this.
Honey, we haven't been out of the trailer in months.
This is the most excitement I've had in years.
I'll tell what, if you play your cards right and don't say anything mean, you might just get lucky tonight.
Oh, is that right?
That is right.
Okay, get to work.
Yeah.
I mean, I wouldn't mind some...
Get to work!
All right.
Okay.
Files are labeled under customer names.
Yeah, mine, too.
What about customers who haven't paid their bills or...
Yeah, arrears.
Yeah.
Okay, it's a long list.
It's a woman.
It's under a woman's name.
Okay.
Okay, that's gotta cut it down.
Um, you ready?
Yeah.
Try "Hilly Martino."
Hilly Martino.
All right, found it.
That is locker number 84.
Oh, that's not it.
Okay...
Um, Elsa Carlingson.
Elsa... yeah, nope.
Okay, Betty Ferguson.
Betty Ferguson.
Betty Ferguson.
Locker number 45.
We got it.
Shh.
Don't get too excited.
Uh...
Says she hasn't paid in three weeks.
Good lord.
That's how long before they start selling your stuff?
That's rough.
They're not fucking around at the u-store-all.
You got an address?
Yup, let's go.
Wait, you mean tonight?
Get the hell outta here.
I don't wanna nose around some serial killer's house in the middle of the night, right?
Copy that.
Copy that.
Right.
This is so crazy.
Tina?
Tina?
Hey, Mick, come on, let's go.
Is that you?
Mick, come on.
Let's go, babe.
Hey!
Mick, come on, let's go.
Please?
Stay in the truck.
I got this.
What are you doing, Mick?
Hey!
Who's there?
I suggest you show your face before I crack it open.
Mick, come on.
No, no, no.
Babe, come on, please?
This is your last warning, bro.
Mick, come on, now!
Hey.
Honking the horn, seriously?
Let's go.
You fucking crazy?
I'm not the one sitting there holding the shovel in his hands.
Let's get out of here.
Who was that guy?
God!
I don't know, but I wanna call Harv, share our intel, huh?
Please, lock your door.
Oh, my god.
That was crazy!
I can't believe we did that.
Hot damn.
That was amazing.
That was nuts.
That was a whole lotta crazy.
You're a whole lotta crazy.
You're crazy.
Thank you.
Off.
Yes.
Off.
My hands are stuck, my hands are stuck.
It's okay, I'll take them outta there.
It's okay.
Oh, Jesus Christ, ray.
Oh, sorry, man, didn't mean to wake you up, just ran out of beer.
You scared the shit out of me.
Do you know what time it is?
Sorry, Mick.
Oh, it's all right.
I can't sleep, anyway.
Grab me one of those, will ya?
You know, you can't keep coming in unannounced like that.
Probably get your head bashed in one of these days.
Okay.
But why so edgy, hasn't ever much bothered you before.
We're in the midst of a thing.
Can't really say.
Oh!
Okay.
Listen, I know it's none of my business, but can I give you some advice?
Yeah.
Don't mess around with shit you don't understand.
Shit you don't know nothing about.
What are you talking about?
I seen all that zodiac killer shit on your table in there.
You're right, it ain't any of your damn business.
There's boundaries, ray.
I don't mind you taking a beer every now and then, but don't be going through my shit, dude.
I was there.
Where?
San Fran-fucking-Cisco.
I was there in the '60s.
That man you're so interested in?
He brought that town to its knees.
He struck fear in the hearts of every single law-abiding citizen in that town.
We was all shitting our pants.
Mommy and daddy didn't wanna send junior to school.
The mailman was worried he was gonna get blown to pieces.
For crying out loud, the cops were walking their beats like they were frightened little schoolgirls just waiting to get picked off on their sidewalks.
'Cause nobody was safe.
Totally unpredictable.
Beautiful.
That man's an absolute genius, the way he evaded the law all this time.
Do you realize that?
There's never ever gonna be another man like him, not never.
You sound like a fan.
Bunch of theories about where he might've got to now.
Some think he might still be alive.
So, do yourself a favor.
Just take my advice, burn that film.
Forget what you seen, get on with your life, 'cause I promise you, nothing good's gonna come from this.
How do you know about the film?
Ah, there's no secret these cardboard walls can keep.
I gotta go.
I got some things I gotta take care of.
At this hour?
I gotta get up early.
Yeah.
Anyway, thanks for the beer.
I'm taking it to go.
All right, dude.
Yeah, baby?
I think it's just...
It's right up here.
Yup.
He's been staked out here all night.
Come on, come on, quick.
Before someone sees you.
Come on.
Quick, quick, quick.
Okay, okay, keep your pants on.
Okay, we are here.
What are we doing?
Now, what do we do?
Knock on her door, tell her her husband's the zodiac killer?
I've been scoping this place out for 18 hours, nobody's come or gone or even taken a piss.
I promise you, nobody's in that fucking house, and if they are, they're dead.
Now, by the way, I did some research.
Betty Ferguson, 91 years old, her husband, Balthazar, 94, both alive.
How the hell do you know that?
You owe me 15 bucks for your half.
Ninety-four years old, I mean...
You guys, he probably already has one foot in the grave.
Look, all we gotta do is find a piece of evidence that ties Ferguson to the film, then we call the police.
Boom, done, ka-ching.
The FBI hasn't been able to catch him all these years, what makes you think we're going to find anything?
Is that the shitty attitude we're going to start with?
Maybe.
How is that a shitty attitude?
Because you're, like, "I don't wanna do this..."
Okay, ladies, ladies.
Ladies, you're both pretty, let's get to work.
Can you open the door?
I thought Tina told you that this lady was loaded?
Oh, shit.
You all right?
I'm fine, go.
Whoa!
We're not going in there.
Worry not, my sweet.
The good lord is watching over you.
We keep making a habit of this.
Well, we're here.
Opportunity has opened its door.
This looks like a haunted house.
That's good.
See, I told you, nobody's here.
Boo!
Wow!
What exactly are we looking for?
Anything.
Everything.
Just keep your eyes open.
Hey.
You think this is Balthazar, or do you think they had a son?
I can't tell.
Look at this.
Golden gate bridge, San Francisco.
Where the murders took place.
So, this...
Yeah.
This has to be their son.
That has to be Balthazar.
Guys, come down here.
Guys, down here.
Watch your step.
Look at this.
What?
What?
What?
Come here.
8mm camera.
Oh...
This could be the fucking camera.
And I found a picture of Balthazar's son in front of the golden gate bridge in San Francisco.
Okay, look, there's gotta be a film reel here.
Just look.
Like, look for a canister.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
Yes.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, he's gone.
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Listen to me, you keep your shit together.
No, you keep your shit together.
You're crazy.
We have to find a reel, let's get a reel.
Two minutes, please?
Come on.
He left.
Let's go.
Hurry up, there's gotta be one here.
Shh.
Found it.
Harv?
No way.
Now, can we please go?
I'll only be one second.
Can we please go now?
Come on.
Come on.
It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, we're clear.
Come on.
Hey!
Christ.
Put it down, or I'll blow your head clean off your neck.
I can't do that, sir.
Okay, take it easy.
No one needs to get hurt, for god's sake.
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my house?
Are you Balthazar Ferguson?
I'm his son, Benjamin.
What are you doing here?
Uh... you know, um, we didn't mean to barge in, but your door was open.
We just...
We bought your mama's storage locker, and we found this, um, film reel.
And we thought, "you know what?
Maybe they might want it back."
I don't understand.
They've lived in Florida for the past few years.
Take a look at this place.
Does it look like they needed a storage locker?
Oh, so, you live here by yourself now?
You guys sure do ask a lot of questions while you're staring down the barrel of a gun.
We're gonna go.
So, thank you, sir.
So sorry.
Let's go, guys.
All right, we're going.
Take it easy.
Stop.
I think you forgot something.
What's that?
The film, just hand it over.
Well, if it isn't your mother's locker, then it's probably not her film.
Yeah, so sorry.
Really, really sorry.
Just, um...
Okay, take care.
Come on.
Ben, everything all right over there?
Yeah, fine.
These folks were just leaving.
Once again, our apologies, sir.
Yeah.
Here's my card.
If you find anything else you think might belong to me...
Try calling next time.
Will do.
Take care!
Didn't catch your name.
Y'all have a nice day.
Bye-bye.
Oh!
God, creepy.
How could you just hand it to him?
That film could have sealed the deal.
Are you serious?
What was I supposed to do, run?
Seriously, you guys, what if that was really the guy and I didn't give him the film?
What?
He would've just killed us right there?
Yeah.
That was the guy.
Yeah, it had to have been.
No, it wasn't.
Harvey?
Are you serious?
What are the chances he'd have a camera and a roll of 8mm film?
And there was the photo of him in San Francisco by the golden gate bridge.
And he worked for a newspaper, which they always thought.
He's the right age.
And it was his storage locker.
And he had a fucking gun in our face.
Why would he let the locker go?
He's old, maybe he just forgot.
Well...
You guys, we gotta go back.
We gotta lift prints, or do something like that.
Lift some prints?
That's my girl, yeah.
You guys been watching too many CSI:
Miami re-runs.
Trust me, he's not our guy.
He didn't have that killer look.
That killer look?
Yeah, no joke.
I saw it in Kuwait.
You know, some soldiers, they live for the action, others were scared shitless, and then there were the stone-cold fucking killers.
When you watch a man kill another man, and then he turns and looks at you, his eyes soft, relaxed, almost satisfied, you know you're in the presence of a real killer.
That other reel should be dry by now.
I'll meet you back at my place, yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Wait, what was that?
Looked like a cipher key.
A what?
What?
Remember I told you that he sent letters to the newspapers in code?
Yeah.
Just watch.
Right after he passes the gun, right before he wipes the blood off the knife.
That paper with the symbols on it.
What do you see?
I think this is a cipher key.
This could be the cipher key.
What are you talking about?
Code-breaking.
The zodiac, he always claimed that his name was in the cipher.
This could be the fucking key.
I'm sorry, Harv,
I don't understand.
Can you just speak English?
Okay, these kinds of codes, they were used by, like, the CIA and foreign governments to encrypt messages going all the way back to world war ii.
Next to each symbol is a letter.
You replace each symbol with the correlating letter, and you have the translation.
I can see that you don't understand.
I'll show you.
I don't understand.
Okay.
What does that say?
It's symbols.
Right.
Now, this is a cipher key.
"E" has a corresponding square.
"O" has an upside-down triangle.
"Z" has a "v."
This reads "Zoe." "Zoe."
It's easy if you have the key.
Almost impossible if you don't.
Oh, man.
This could be the key to the 340.
What's the 340?
It's the unsolved cipher.
The 408 was broken.
How do you know all this shit?
Two tours, special ops, remember?
They taught you code-breaking in Kuwait?
Oh, yeah, it's like the ABCs of electronic intelligence, but back in the day, code-breaking was like basic training.
Think you could crack it?
If this is a cipher key, fucking a.
Okay.
I gotta get into this.
Why don't you guys check on Ben's history?
Like, go to town hall and newspapers and see if he has a military record.
Because this shit here is military 101.
Done.
Yeah?
My coat, thanks.
Hey, Harvey, good one.
Hey, by the way, bring me your reel in the morning.
I wanna put it in my safe.
Babe, Harvey wouldn't screw us over.
He's a good guy, right?
I don't know.
Let me just drop you off at town hall and I'll go hide the film.
Wait, are you saying you don't trust him either?
Let's just say I wanna make sure we get our half.
Smart boy.
Yup.
Hey.
Um...
Call you when I'm done?
Careful.
Love ya.
Love ya!
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Oh...
Tri-county news ledger.
Yes, no problem.
Thank you.
Hey, excuse me?
Hi.
Um...
These only go back to 1980.
Where would I find articles dating back to the late '60s?
Archives is in the basement.
Oh.
For employees only.
Um...
Polly, it's kind of important.
I'm sorry, we're about to close.
I bet you are, but it's just that I was...
Um...
I've been at city records, and couldn't find what I was looking for over there and it would be so helpful...
Miss, I can't help you.
Tri-county news ledger.
Hey, Polly.
Yes, he is.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he is.
Okay, I'll let him know.
Thanks, Polly.
Thank you.
Thank you, Polly!
Okay.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Yup.
Hello.
God damn it.
Hello?
Hello?
"The zodiac has fled the west coast, leaving behind a trail
"of unsolved murders across the country.
"I have provided authorities with
"new evidence from an unnamed source
"that I believe will eventually
"lead to the identity of the elusive killer."
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, Mick.
Um, Mick, it's me.
Listen, I'm at the paper.
I need you to come get me because I think I found something good.
Um... okay, I'm here.
Come get me, now.
Okay, bye.
Shit.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Oh, god!
Shit!
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.
Um...
Okay, Ferguson.
Um...
He was an only child.
He was born and raised here.
He was never married.
He never had kids.
Uh, he served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1964.
Zodiac's first kill was 1968.
Then after Vietnam, in 1965, he got a job with a paper in San Francisco as a crime reporter.
San Francisco?
Oh, this is good.
Yeah.
Okay, but there's just a little hitch in the giddy-up.
So, for some reason, Ferguson decided to leave that job with that paper in San Francisco and move back here to start a job with the old ledger on, um, October the 1st, 1969.
The thing is, Paul Lee Stine was killed in San Francisco on October 11th, 1969.
Shit.
Told you.
So, listen,
I know he's weird, but he can't be our guy because he was here, 2,500 miles away.
But listen to this,
I found an article that Ferguson wrote about zodiac.
And Ferguson was tracking this string of murders across the country, and he had come up with this theory that zodiac was actually making his way across the country to here.
So, maybe Ferguson was actually onto the zodiac, and maybe the zodiac is still here now.
Or he was leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for the police to follow.
Oh, my god, what are you talking about?
Why aren't you listening to me?
Shit, I don't know.
Some people say he didn't even live in San Fran.
What people?
I read it on a fan site.
He has fans?
Apparently.
Lots of them.
Do you see a guy?
Feels like there's a guy just parked behind us.
I'm probably...
Let's get out of here.
Babe, let's just go.
What the hell?
No, no, no.
I'm gonna kick this guy's ass.
No, no.
Don't you...
No, no, no.
Honey, honey!
Hey!
Get in the car, let's just go.
I'm not...
Fine!
Go ahead!
Come on!
Did you get a good look at him?
No, I did not get a good look.
God, I don't wanna do this anymore.
Mick, it's getting too crazy, and I...
Zoe, we need this.
I don't...
I'm out.
We don't need this, Mick.
Do you know what half of $100,000 is?
You know what?
Don't act like I'm an idiot.
Mick, put that gun down!
Jesus Christ.
It's $50,000, Mick!
- That's it!
- That's a lot of money.
I think I'm worth more than $25,000.
That's not what I meant.
Look at you.
This is the zodiac speaking.
This is the zodiac speaking.
This is the zodiac speaking.
This is the zodiac speaking.
Son of a bitch.
- What is it?
- I think he's out there.
This is the zodiac speaking.
God damn it.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Zoe?
Fuck!
Baby...
Fuck you.
Jesus.
No, fuck you!
Don't you fucking come...
Fuck you!
Everything okay?
Do you know who owns this car?
This car?
It's whoever she's sleeping with.
Her in that trailer, what's her name?
Uh...
Come on, you know it.
Spanish name...
Valencia, that's it.
Now, the thing about Valencia is, there's a different car here, like, every night.
Although I hate to be judgmental, she's kind of a whore.
I don't know if that helps, does it?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
No.
Hey, baby.
You know I'm sorry.
You pointed a gun in my face, that's not okay.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
And, obviously, sorry isn't cutting it, I...
I know I messed up.
That's an understatement.
Messed up bad, but, baby, I swear,
I heard something.
Zoe, I need you.
I do, I can't do this without you.
Can we please just go see if Harvey's figured out the cipher key?
Hmm?
Maybe he has.
Maybe this is all over already.
And if it doesn't pan out,
I'll work our way out of this.
I promise, no more storage lockers, no more nothing.
I promise you.
I will give you one more day.
Ah, shit.
Come on in, close the door.
Shut the door!
Fast!
Jesus.
Just shut it.
Holy shit, Harvey.
I've almost figured it out.
This fucking dude was a genius, man.
He used a combination of a Caesar, Vigenere and pigpen cipher.
Look, I'll explain it to you.
You see this symbol?
All these years, codebreakers have considered this its own character, right?
This one symbol is four letters, but this... this symbol here, this is one letter, shifted with a Caesar cipher.
Like a fucking brainiac, this guy.
Okay, so, I can make some critical assumptions, and I've narrowed it down to suspects that live within a 50-mile radius.
That's only hundreds.
No, no, no.
I think it's Ben Ferguson.
No.
Yeah, yeah, he served in the military.
He was in San Fran between '67 and '69.
Mick, Mick, you're like everybody else.
You're trying to fit the evidence to the suspect.
That's not how you do it.
It's not Ben Ferguson.
I don't know how many fucking times I have to say that.
Don't even try, he won't even listen.
Mick, his name doesn't even fit in the cipher.
I just need some more time.
I kind of just, like, fell asleep for an hour, but if I can get one more symbol,
I can eliminate 97% of these names, okay?
I can't do it with you guys here, though.
You need to...
All right.
I need to be alone, so...
Can ya pick me up a sandwich, or something?
I'm fucking starving.
All right, great.
Yeah.
Harvey seems like he's losing it.
Yeah.
I got it.
I got it!
I got it!
It's "e"!
It's fucking "e"!
Okay, okay, okay.
Eliminate those.
Boo-yah!
Do you see that?
Yup.
Don't brake, don't brake.
Mick, please drive.
Drive.
All right.
Holy shit.
You think Tina reported our little break-in?
It's fine, it'll blow over.
Just...
let's go get Harvey his food.
Where's Harvey's Van?
Doubt he'd leave.
By the smell of him, he hasn't left this place in two days.
Can you...
Yes.
Honey, we're home!
Harvey?
We brought you some barbecue.
Where you at?
Harvey?
Whoa!
He split.
What?
He split.
No.
No, no, no.
Not gonna let him get away with this.
He's gonna take the whole reward.
Oh, god.
I knew he'd do something like this.
God damn it.
Oh, Mick.
What a jerk.
Shit.
He's such a jerk.
No, no, no.
It's gonna be fine.
Something in these pages.
He said if he could find, uh, one more of these symbols...
Uh-huh.
He could cut that list down to...
Like a handful, right?
Right?
Yeah, right, right.
Baby, look.
He did it.
He found it.
He figured it out.
Holy shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This...
Okay, I've got a page here with all the names and addresses crossed off.
I got one more.
Oh, good.
One... that's one, two, three.
Okay, hold on.
Here's one not crossed off.
Uh...
Gimme that.
I've got one, too.
Ah!
Here's one crossed off.
What do you got?
How many is that?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... nine.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, baby.
Yeah, all right.
We're not looking for the zodiac now.
Here.
Now...
Thank you.
We're going after Harvey.
You're sure you're up for this?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Okay.
Jesus.
Shit.
What is it?
I don't know.
Ugh, look for some shotgun shells for that thing, okay, hon?
Okay, I got it.
Go.
Hey, Mick, I found some!
Great.
Mick!
Mick, Harvey just took off!
Get down here!
Hang on.
Zoe.
Honey, he's getting away!
Shit.
Damn it!
Zoe!
Jesus!
Zoe!
Mick?
Zoe.
Okay, listen to me.
Harvey...
No, no, listen to me.
I can see Harvey's Van right in front of me, okay?
I love you.
Just come get me.
Bye!
No, no, no, Harvey's dead!
Fuck!
Where are the goddamn keys?
Come on.
Hey, it's Zoe.
Leave a...
Damn it.
Come on, Zoe.
Pick up.
Hey, it's Zoe.
Leave a message.
Damn it!
Come on.
Come on.
Where are you?
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Damn it.
911.
State your emergency.
My wife's been abducted.
What is your name, sir, and what is your location?
Yeah, I'm Mick Bradley.
I'm at 1228 cherry street.
A man is dead.
Sir, calm down.
There's a unit on its way.
Okay, okay.
Harvey!
Don't move!
What are you doing, man?
Harvey, don't play games with me...
I got a big-ass gun, Harvey, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Come on!
Laurel.
Laurel.
Zoe?
This is the zodiac speaking.
I have your wife.
She doesn't have to die.
You listen to me.
Don't you fucking touch her, I'll...
You'll what?
You do not have control here.
The police do.
The police are, what?
On their way?
Oh, then I guess she's going to have to die.
No, no.
Don't, don't, don't.
They don't know anything.
And?
And I have the film reel.
Good.
Well, then perhaps there is hope for her yet.
Zoe, is it?
Please, don't.
I assume that as you have made it this far, you know how to find me.
You must be very proud.
Fuck you.
After all these years, after all the police departments and the FBI profilers and programmers, all looking for me, they all come up empty.
But you, you found me.
Now, go figure.
Why?
Well, you have my films.
Now, I quit.
Cold Turkey.
For 40 years.
You have no idea the monumental effort that that took.
But I got away Scot-free.
Except for Ben, of course.
He got close.
Him I had to follow.
I followed him all the way from San Francisco.
I was gonna kill him, but I grew to like it here.
Now, that fat-ass woman, she sold my locker.
I missed two payments.
My memory ain't what it used to be.
Too bad.
I wanna tell you something.
This is my story.
You're not gonna destroy my legend.
I left you a way out if you're brave enough to try.
You know, they herded a lot of young animals through here on their last journey.
And they designed this place to ease their anxiety as they herded them to the slaughter.
I don't think it's gonna have the same effect on you.
It's gonna hurt, but what can I say?
Enjoy.
Oh, your husband's on his way.
I'm gonna kill him first.
No!
No!
God.
Fuck!
Ow!
God damn it!
Come on, baby, come on.
Come on.
All right, there it is.
There it is.
Forty-five.
.38 caliber.
Holy shit, it fits.
Come on!
Where is she?
Oh, she's fine.
I need to see the reel.
You put down your goddamn gun!
I need to see the film!
Okay.
Fuck.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ow!
By golly, I nailed him.
No, you...
Zoe?
- Zoe?
- Mick?
Mick, baby, I'm over here!
Shit.
Mick, he's in here.
Where is he?
Mick, help!
Mick!
Mick!
Mick, Mick, Mick!
Jesus Christ.
We gotta get out of here somewhere.
I know.
We have to get out of here.
Go!
Go!
Go, baby!
Go!
Ahh!
Fuck.
Fuck you!
Get the fuck...
Fuck!
Don't move!
Don't fucking move!
Well, this is not gonna end well for you.
I will shoot that fucking smile off your fucking face, grandpa,
I swear to god, I will.
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
A lot of people have tried.
Shut up!
Put me out of my misery.
Go ahead, do it now!
By golly,
I wish this could go on forever.
Zoe!
Mick.
Mick.
Behind you!
God... come here.
Oh, my god.
After four weeks of investigation, the FBI, with the cooperation of the local authorities, using DNA evidence, have positively linked the deceased to the three local homicides.
We have been unable to make a positive identification on the deceased.
We are currently investigating those scenes and his residence for any other pertinent evidence.
The investigation is ongoing, but I can tell you at this time we cannot exclude or confirm the DNA of the now deceased suspect as a match for the zodiac killer.
After 40 years, the earlier samples are just unreliable.
I know there's a lot of families out there that are looking for some closure, but, uh, it's gonna take a long, long time before we know for sure.
I'll take your questions now.
- Shit.
Hey.
- What?
Mick?
What's wrong?
What is it?
No, baby.
It's just me just being my clumsy self.
Have I been sleeping?
You've been asleep for a long time.
Sorry.
It's okay, come here.
Come here.
Come sit with me.
It's going to be all right.
There you go.
Oh... yeah, look at us.
Hey, so, frank came by today.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He offered me my old job at the mill.
Even some extra hours doing security.
Did you take it?
Hell, yeah, I did.
That's good.
Mm.
It's time to make a real go of things, baby.
You mean the world to me.
What's wrong with that light?
It's just... it's a light.
It's always like that.
You know, it just needs a good kicking.
We gotta...
We should fix it.
I'll tell ya what,
I'm gonna go fix it right now, okay?
No, no, no, please stay here.
Just please stay here.
Baby, baby, it's okay.
It's okay.
I got this, all right?
I don't want you to go.
I'll be back in a second, okay?
Hey, I love you.
Just breathe.
Mick?
Mick?
Mick!
Mick?
Stop.
What?
Someone's coming.
Shit.
Who is it?
Beats me, I can't see anything.
This is freaking me out, Adam, you said that no one ever comes up here.
Are you okay, ma'am?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, officer.
I suppose you gave us a bit of a scare.
There's no parking here after sundown.
Sorry, officer.
You been drinking, son?
Mama said never to drink on a first date.
First date, very nice.
All right.
You kids get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, officer.
Sorry, officer.
Oh, boy, what a drag.
You are so lucky he didn't bust you for drinking.
Yeah, he had no right.
Besides, only park rangers can ticket you in these parts.
You are so full of it.
Come on.
This guy is just dying to give us a ticket.
What the hell is he doing?
God damn.
No, Adam.
You're such an idiot!
Officer, I don't know what you think I was doing, but...
Hey, you're not the...
What the hell is that?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, mister, I'm talking to you!
No, Adam!
Please, no, we didn't do anything wrong!
Run, lula!
Run!
Help!
Help!
Hey, honey, I'm home.
Hey.
Hey.
What did you do with the, uh, grocery money?
And how was your day?
Let me tell you a little bit about mine.
It was great.
You want one?
Where'd it all go?
To our future.
Harvey won us the bid on that storage locker.
Oh, god, another one?
You know, it's your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your future, Zoe.
What?
That's a quote by your Anthony Robbins.
You didn't even read that book.
Maybe a little.
Oh, my god.
Baby, we got that riding mower, remember?
We sold that for a good buck, and then what about that storage locker with all that silverware?
We made out like bandits on that.
Mick, that's two, what about all the other ones?
Oh, lord Jesus.
Okay, what did you end up paying for this one?
1,200 what?
$1,200?
Yeah.
Mick, that's three months' rent.
Harv and I split it, so...
I'm gonna kill you right now.
I'm mad at you, we can't...
Mick, we're never gonna get out of this shitbox betting on storage lockers.
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
I mean... oh, god.
It's not what I'm saying, it's what you're saying.
You sit there, and you sit there, and go,
"oh, Zoe, I wanna give you a better life."
"Oh, Zoe, I wanna actually give you a real house one day."
But I'm the only grown-up standing here in the room, and I don't wanna be the grown-up.
Don't even, don't even.
No, no, no, no, no, just...
What?
This is your special spot, your special spot.
I hate you so much right now.
What do we own now?
Well, let's go talk to Harvey, and check it out, right?
You're so rotten.
Stop it.
Get outta here.
Come on, babe.
So, Tina, she was the one who tipped us off.
She said it was owned by some rich old woman.
And I ain't talking like, living in a trailer with a caddy in the driveway kind of rich,
I'm talking more like real housewives of Atlanta kind of rich.
Baby, we got to take this thing in before it completely craps out on us, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Just as soon as we can pay for it.
Cut me some slack.
I didn't say anything!
I'm just trying to dig us out of this rut.
Do you have a bulldozer?
Pfft.
Man, you know I'm ain't programed to take shit from nobody.
It ain't in my genes.
Is having a roof over your head in your genes?
How much money do you think you've actually made on these lockers over the past two years?
I don't know, a little over $1,000.
So, you just threw most of that back today on one locker.
That's all I'm saying.
My sister's got it better than us, and she's in jail.
Hot damn, you serious?
I got a good feeling about this one, okay?
Oh, baby, you always do.
I got a good feeling about this one.
You always do.
Come on, get in here.
Jesus, Harvey.
You look like shit.
Diggity.
Hot diggity.
Aw, now, there's a ray of sunshine.
Where have you been?
Oh, hey, Harvey.
Hey, you know what?
You get prettier and prettier every time I see ya.
Don't try to sweet talk me, where's all the crap you guys bought?
It's that pile right there.
Hey, you want a beer?
Sure.
Man, you look like you haven't slept.
Wow!
I haven't.
So, this is it?
Yeah, well, those are the best pieces.
That's, uh, like, I don't know, 300 bucks, and we got some stuff back in the locker, $100, $120.
So, we're talking $400, $425 for the whole lot.
$425 for the whole thing?
Whoo!
Hold on, hold on.
Tina's never steered us wrong before.
Well, honey, looks like you guys got screwed like a 10-cent whore on nickel night.
No, no, no.
I was going through those boxes there, and I found something.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Follow me.
It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser.
Come here, check this out.
Home movies?
They're dated.
09-27-69.
Oh, great, so, now you're the proud owners of somebody's 40-year-old wedding movies.
No, not a wedding.
I watched them.
Follow me.
Up here.
Go in straight, and then to your right.
Oh, real classy, harv.
Don't fucking touch that.
That's collector's edition.
How do you keep inventory of all this crap?
Oh, Christ, Harvey.
I got a photographic memory.
I think you have a concussion right about now.
Hey, let's watch some movies!
What do you keep in here, a dead body?
Oh, Jesus.
You okay?
Can we just go?
Yeah, let's, uh...
Harv?
Harvey?
Harvey?
Here.
Okay, so, home movies.
I really hope this gets better, harv.
Just keep watching.
Shit.
What happened?
Uh, this film, it's just really old and degraded.
It's okay, I saw it.
Is it ruined?
What was it?
Can you just hold your panties?
I'll hold my panties.
I'm just gonna put in the second reel.
Just have some Patience.
Here we go.
This one's hard to watch.
Whoa!
What the hell is this, harv?
It's the zodiac.
Zodiac?
Yeah, that's why I stayed up all night researching this shit.
This guy claims to have killed 37 people.
Only, the cops confirmed five.
Holy shit.
Here.
He taunted the police with letters containing ciphers that to this day have gone unsolved.
Not even the FBI have been able to solve them.
There he is.
That's our guy in the film.
Jesus Christ.
I've seen that picture before.
The numbers on these cans.
09-27-69.
Punch that in, babe.
"Napa, California.
Cecelia Shepard attacked on..."
"September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of lake berryessa."
"Shepard died of her wounds."
See, what'd I tell ya?
What are the other dates on those?
06-18-68.
06-18-68.
Nothing.
All right.
Try 08-31-68.
08-31-68.
- Nope.
- Search "murders."
He was never caught.
The search for the zodiac killer has been like the search for the fucking holy grail.
Here you go.
Okay.
First of all, you don't even know if those are real, and second, you should let the police handle this.
That's what I would do.
How is any of this stuff in an old lady's locker?
Maybe it wasn't an old lady's locker.
Mick, think about it, you'd never store evidence like this in your own name, right?
Well...
"San Francisco police department re-opens zodiac case."
Which is exactly why you call the police.
No, no, you're not looking close enough.
Look where it says, "reward for evidence leading to the zodiac killer."
$100,000.
Boo-yah!
Divine intervention.
Come on, baby.
This could be my ticket to Costa Rica.
You guys are nuts.
Zoe, there are a million theories on the Internet that the zodiac filmed his kills.
I've seen my fair share of America's most wanted.
This is not enough evidence to prove anything.
No, you're absolutely right.
All we have to do is find out who they belong to, and then we have something worth 100,000 fucking dollars.
Hey, Mick?
I gotta go, I gotta go do, um, Ellie's hair.
I'll be in the vehicle.
She'll be fine.
She's been this way since Freda closed the salon.
Are you sure we can make some money off this thing?
I don't know, man, but I do know that that's the guy on the film.
Here.
You take it, you put it in a safe place because these could be our meal tickets.
We go 50-50, you want to do this with me.
Come on, man.
We already know where the first stop is, right?
Fifty-fifty.
Fiddy-fiddy.
$50,000 each.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
Evening, ray.
Good night, ray.
Baby.
Come on, come to bed.
We can talk about this tomorrow.
Um, there's nothing to talk about.
It's a lot of money.
Do you hear yourself, Mick?
Because you are talking, um, about a serial killer, so...
I know.
Good.
So, there's nothing to talk about.
Baby, I get a vote in this, too.
We are talking about $100,000.
Mick, I let you convince me to move to this shitty town.
Oh...
I let you convince me to sell my mama's jewelry to pay rent and pay the bills...
Hey, hey, what'd you want me to do?
You were out of work.
That's not fair because I am doing my part in this, okay?
I did Ellie today, I have somebody tomorrow...
And that helps, but, baby, I am not making shit mowing lawns and throwing out trash.
So, your solution is hunting a serial killer for a reward?
It's $100,000.
Good night.
Hey, baby.
You left without saying goodbye.
I know, you were sleeping and I didn't want to wake you.
Look, Mick, I don't want to fight with you.
Neither do I.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but, um... oh, lord Jesus.
If you honestly think this thing is legit, then let's do it.
Are you sure you're up for this?
No, but that's real money, and we're running out of options.
This could be the one we're been waiting for, baby.
I hope so.
All right, let me check back in with Harvey then.
Great, love you.
Love you, too.
All right.
This is Tina.
Uh-huh.
Tina, why'd you change the lock on my locker?
I gotta get in there...
I've heard it all before, honey.
Just come by the office tomorrow and make a partial payment, okay?
All right.
All right.
Oh, jeez.
All right, harv, we're in.
You mean Zoe said yes?
Oh, shut up, and let's just get to work.
Shut up, Harvey.
What is that smell?
Yes, this is perchlorethylene.
It's like a pedicure for this old film.
It, like, pulls off any sludge and restores moisture.
Yeah, so, it won't burn up again.
Huh.
Well, aren't you a trick.
You should give me your reel, so I can clean it up.
Oh, our reel is doing just fine, harv.
Well, I hope you have it hid good 'cause it's half the key to our fortune.
We heard you the first time, harv.
It's taken care of.
We're gonna talk to Tina at the u-store-all.
Yep.
And find out who actually rented this locker.
Oh, good idea.
Now, I wanna see the rest of that crap we bought.
All right.
Which one is it?
This one right here.
What the hell?
Where's all the crap?
I sure as hell hope Tina moved it.
Ugh!
What the hell?
Ugh...
She's always here.
Tina, it's Mick.
Where are you?
I need to get some things.
Call me back asap, huh?
Yeah, I don't get this.
She's always here.
Honey, I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure she just ran out to get a bite to eat or something.
God damn it.
Jeez.
What, are you gonna go in, guns-a-blazing?
Break in the joint?
I don't know, maybe just have a look around.
Oh, no, oh.
Oh, my god.
This is a very bad idea.
Get down.
Okay, this is perfect.
Okay.
Okay, what are we doing?
This is the locker number.
I want you to check the computer, I'll check the filing cabinets.
You realize that you seem oddly comfortable with all of this.
Honey, we haven't been out of the trailer in months.
This is the most excitement I've had in years.
I'll tell what, if you play your cards right and don't say anything mean, you might just get lucky tonight.
Oh, is that right?
That is right.
Okay, get to work.
Yeah.
I mean, I wouldn't mind some...
Get to work!
All right.
Okay.
Files are labeled under customer names.
Yeah, mine, too.
What about customers who haven't paid their bills or...
Yeah, arrears.
Yeah.
Okay, it's a long list.
It's a woman.
It's under a woman's name.
Okay.
Okay, that's gotta cut it down.
Um, you ready?
Yeah.
Try "hilly martino."
Hilly martino.
All right, found it.
That is locker number 84.
Oh, that's not it.
Okay...
Um, Elsa carlingson.
Elsa... yeah, nope.
Okay, Betty ferguson.
Betty ferguson.
Betty ferguson.
Locker number 45.
We got it.
Shh.
Don't get too excited.
Uh...
Says she hasn't paid in three weeks.
Good lord.
That's how long before they start selling your stuff?
That's rough.
They're not fucking around at the u-store-all.
You got an address?
Yup, let's go.
Wait, you mean tonight?
Get the hell outta here.
I don't wanna nose around some serial killer's house in the middle of the night, right?
Copy that.
Copy that.
Right.
This is so crazy.
Tina?
Tina?
Hey, Mick, come on, let's go.
Is that you?
Mick, come on.
Let's go, babe.
Hey!
Mick, come on, let's go.
Please?
Stay in the truck.
I got this.
What are you doing, Mick?
Hey!
Who's there?
I suggest you show your face before I crack it open.
Mick, come on.
No, no, no.
Babe, come on, please?
This is your last warning, bro.
Mick, come on, now!
Hey.
Honking the horn, seriously?
Let's go.
You fucking crazy?
I'm not the one sitting there holding the shovel in his hands.
Let's get out of here.
Who was that guy?
God!
I don't know, but I wanna call harv, share our intel, huh?
Please, lock your door.
Oh, my god.
That was crazy!
I can't believe we did that.
Hot damn.
That was amazing.
That was nuts.
That was a whole lotta crazy.
You're a whole lotta crazy.
You're crazy.
Thank you.
Off.
Yes.
Off.
My hands are stuck, my hands are stuck.
It's okay, I'll take them outta there.
It's okay.
Oh, Jesus Christ, ray.
Oh, sorry, man, didn't mean to wake you up, just ran out of beer.
You scared the shit out of me.
Do you know what time it is?
Sorry, Mick.
Oh, it's all right.
I can't sleep, anyway.
Grab me one of those, will ya?
You know, you can't keep coming in unannounced like that.
Probably get your head bashed in one of these days.
Okay.
But why so edgy, hasn't ever much bothered you before.
We're in the midst of a thing.
Can't really say.
Oh!
Okay.
Listen, I know it's none of my business, but can I give you some advice?
Yeah.
Don't mess around with shit you don't understand.
Shit you don't know nothing about.
What are you talking about?
I seen all that zodiac killer shit on your table in there.
You're right, it ain't any of your damn business.
There's boundaries, ray.
I don't mind you taking a beer every now and then, but don't be going through my shit, dude.
I was there.
Where?
San Fran-fucking-cisco.
I was there in the '60s.
That man you're so interested in?
He brought that town to its knees.
He struck fear in the hearts of every single law-abiding citizen in that town.
We was all shitting our pants.
Mommy and daddy didn't wanna send junior to school.
The mailman was worried he was gonna get blown to pieces.
For crying out loud, the cops were walking their beats like they were frightened little schoolgirls just waiting to get picked off on their sidewalks.
'Cause nobody was safe.
Totally unpredictable.
Beautiful.
That man's an absolute genius, the way he evaded the law all this time.
Do you realize that?
There's never ever gonna be another man like him, not never.
You sound like a fan.
Bunch of theories about where he might've got to now.
Some think he might still be alive.
So, do yourself a favor.
Just take my advice, burn that film.
Forget what you seen, get on with your life, 'cause I promise you, nothing good's gonna come from this.
How do you know about the film?
Ah, there's no secret these cardboard walls can keep.
I gotta go.
I got some things I gotta take care of.
At this hour?
I gotta get up early.
Yeah.
Anyway, thanks for the beer.
I'm taking it to go.
All right, dude.
Yeah, baby?
I think it's just...
It's right up here.
Yup.
He's been staked out here all night.
Come on, come on, quick.
Before someone sees you.
Come on.
Quick, quick, quick.
Okay, okay, keep your pants on.
Okay, we are here.
What are we doing?
Now, what do we do?
Knock on her door, tell her her husband's the zodiac killer?
I've been scoping this place out for 18 hours, nobody's come or gone or even taken a piss.
I promise you, nobody's in that fucking house, and if they are, they're dead.
Now, by the way, I did some research.
Betty ferguson, 91 years old, her husband, balthazar, 94, both alive.
How the hell do you know that?
You owe me 15 bucks for your half.
Ninety-four years old, I mean...
You guys, he probably already has one foot in the grave.
Look, all we gotta do is find a piece of evidence that ties ferguson to the film, then we call the police.
Boom, done, ka-ching.
The FBI hasn't been able to catch him all these years, what makes you think we're going to find anything?
Is that the shitty attitude we're going to start with?
Maybe.
How is that a shitty attitude?
Because you're, like, "I don't wanna do this..."
Okay, ladies, ladies.
Ladies, you're both pretty, let's get to work.
Can you open the door?
I thought Tina told you that this lady was loaded?
Oh, shit.
You all right?
I'm fine, go.
Whoa!
We're not going in there.
Worry not, my sweet.
The good lord is watching over you.
We keep making a habit of this.
Well, we're here.
Opportunity has opened its door.
This looks like a haunted house.
That's good.
See, I told you, nobody's here.
Boo!
Wow!
What exactly are we looking for?
Anything.
Everything.
Just keep your eyes open.
Hey.
You think this is balthazar, or do you think they had a son?
I can't tell.
Look at this.
Golden gate bridge, San Francisco.
Where the murders took place.
So, this...
Yeah.
This has to be their son.
That has to be balthazar.
Guys, come down here.
Guys, down here.
Watch your step.
Look at this.
What?
What?
What?
Come here. 8mm camera.
Oh...
This could be the fucking camera.
And I found a picture of balthazar's son in front of the golden gate bridge in San Francisco.
Okay, look, there's gotta be a film reel here.
Just look.
Like, look for a canister.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
Yes.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, he's gone.
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Listen to me, you keep your shit together.
No, you keep your shit together.
You're crazy.
We have to find a reel, let's get a reel.
Two minutes, please?
Come on.
He left.
Let's go.
Hurry up, there's gotta be one here.
Shh.
Found it.
Harv?
No way.
Now, can we please go?
I'll only be one second.
Can we please go now?
Come on.
Come on.
It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, we're clear.
Come on.
Hey!
Christ.
Put it down, or I'll blow your head clean off your neck.
I can't do that, sir.
Okay, take it easy.
No one needs to get hurt, for god's sake.
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my house?
Are you balthazar ferguson?
I'm his son, Benjamin.
What are you doing here?
Uh... you know, um, we didn't mean to barge in, but your door was open.
We just...
We bought your mama's storage locker, and we found this, um, film reel.
And we thought, "you know what?
Maybe they might want it back."
I don't understand.
They've lived in Florida for the past few years.
Take a look at this place.
Does it look like they needed a storage locker?
Oh, so, you live here by yourself now?
You guys sure do ask a lot of questions while you're staring down the barrel of a gun.
We're gonna go.
So, thank you, sir.
So sorry.
Let's go, guys.
All right, we're going.
Take it easy.
Stop.
I think you forgot something.
What's that?
The film, just hand it over.
Well, if it isn't your mother's locker, then it's probably not her film.
Yeah, so sorry.
Really, really sorry.
Just, um...
Okay, take care.
Come on.
Ben, everything all right over there?
Yeah, fine.
These folks were just leaving.
Once again, our apologies, sir.
Yeah.
Here's my card.
If you find anything else you think might belong to me...
Try calling next time.
Will do.
Take care!
Didn't catch your name.
Y'all have a nice day.
Bye-bye.
Oh!
God, creepy.
How could you just hand it to him?
That film could have sealed the deal.
Are you serious?
What was I supposed to do, run?
Seriously, you guys, what if that was really the guy and I didn't give him the film?
What?
He would've just killed us right there?
Yeah.
That was the guy.
Yeah, it had to have been.
No, it wasn't.
Harvey?
Are you serious?
What are the chances he'd have a camera and a roll of 8mm film?
And there was the photo of him in San Francisco by the golden gate bridge.
And he worked for a newspaper, which they always thought.
He's the right age.
And it was his storage locker.
And he had a fucking gun in our face.
Why would he let the locker go?
He's old, maybe he just forgot.
Well...
You guys, we gotta go back.
We gotta lift prints, or do something like that.
Lift some prints?
That's my girl, yeah.
You guys been watching too many CSI:
Miami re-runs.
Trust me, he's not our guy.
He didn't have that killer look.
That killer look?
Yeah, no joke.
I saw it in Kuwait.
You know, some soldiers, they live for the action, others were scared shitless, and then there were the stone-cold fucking killers.
When you watch a man kill another man, and then he turns and looks at you, his eyes soft, relaxed, almost satisfied, you know you're in the presence of a real killer.
That other reel should be dry by now.
I'll meet you back at my place, yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Wait, what was that?
Looked like a cipher key.
A what?
What?
Remember I told you that he sent letters to the newspapers in code?
Yeah.
Just watch.
Right after he passes the gun, right before he wipes the blood off the knife.
That paper with the symbols on it.
What do you see?
I think this is a cipher key.
This could be the cipher key.
What are you talking about?
Code-breaking.
The zodiac, he always claimed that his name was in the cipher.
This could be the fucking key.
I'm sorry, harv,
I don't understand.
Can you just speak English?
Okay, these kinds of codes, they were used by, like, the CIA and foreign governments to encrypt messages going all the way back to world war ii.
Next to each symbol is a letter.
You replace each symbol with the correlating letter, and you have the translation.
I can see that you don't understand.
I'll show you.
I don't understand.
Okay.
What does that say?
It's symbols.
Right.
Now, this is a cipher key.
"E" has a corresponding square.
"O" has an upside-down triangle.
"Z" has a "v."
This reads "Zoe." "Zoe."
It's easy if you have the key.
Almost impossible if you don't.
Oh, man.
This could be the key to the 340.
What's the 340?
It's the unsolved cipher.
The 408 was broken.
How do you know all this shit?
Two tours, special ops, remember?
They taught you code-breaking in Kuwait?
Oh, yeah, it's like the abcs of electronic intelligence, but back in the day, code-breaking was like basic training.
Think you could crack it?
If this is a cipher key, fucking a.
Okay.
I gotta get into this.
Why don't you guys check on Ben's history?
Like, go to town hall and newspapers and see if he has a military record.
Because this shit here is military 101.
Done.
Yeah?
My coat, thanks.
Hey, Harvey, good one.
Hey, by the way, bring me your reel in the morning.
I wanna put it in my safe.
Babe, Harvey wouldn't screw us over.
He's a good guy, right?
I don't know.
Let me just drop you off at town hall and I'll go hide the film.
Wait, are you saying you don't trust him either?
Let's just say I wanna make sure we get our half.
Smart boy.
Yup.
Hey.
Um...
Call you when I'm done?
Careful.
Love ya.
Love ya!
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Oh...
Tri-county news ledger.
Yes, no problem.
Thank you.
Hey, excuse me?
Hi.
Um...
These only go back to 1980.
Where would I find articles dating back to the late '60s?
Archives is in the basement.
Oh.
For employees only.
Um...
Polly, it's kind of important.
I'm sorry, we're about to close.
I bet you are, but it's just that I was...
Um...
I've been at city records, and couldn't find what I was looking for over there and it would be so helpful...
Miss, I can't help you.
Tri-county news ledger.
Hey, Polly.
Yes, he is.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he is.
Okay, I'll let him know.
Thanks, Polly.
Thank you.
Thank you, Polly!
Okay.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Yup.
Hello.
God damn it.
Hello?
Hello?
"The zodiac has fled the west coast, leaving behind a trail"
"of unsolved murders across the country."
"I have provided authorities with"
"new evidence from an unnamed source"
"that I believe will eventually"
"lead to the identity of the elusive killer."
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, Mick.
Um, Mick, it's me.
Listen, I'm at the paper.
I need you to come get me because I think I found something good.
Um... okay, I'm here.
Come get me, now.
Okay, bye.
Shit.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Oh, god!
Shit!
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.
Um...
Okay, ferguson.
Um...
He was an only child.
He was born and raised here.
He was never married.
He never had kids.
Uh, he served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1964.
Zodiac's first kill was 1968.
Then after Vietnam, in 1965, he got a job with a paper in San Francisco as a crime reporter.
San Francisco?
Oh, this is good.
Yeah.
Okay, but there's just a little hitch in the giddy-up.
So, for some reason, ferguson decided to leave that job with that paper in San Francisco and move back here to start a job with the old ledger on, um, October the 1st, 1969.
The thing is, Paul Lee stine was killed in San Francisco on October 11th, 1969.
Shit.
Told you.
So, listen,
I know he's weird, but he can't be our guy because he was here, 2,500 miles away.
But listen to this,
I found an article that ferguson wrote about zodiac.
And ferguson was tracking this string of murders across the country, and he had come up with this theory that zodiac was actually making his way across the country to here.
So, maybe ferguson was actually onto the zodiac, and maybe the zodiac is still here now.
Or he was leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for the police to follow.
Oh, my god, what are you talking about?
Why aren't you listening to me?
Shit, I don't know.
Some people say he didn't even live in San Fran.
What people?
I read it on a fan site.
He has fans?
Apparently.
Lots of them.
Do you see a guy?
Feels like there's a guy just parked behind us.
I'm probably...
Let's get out of here.
Babe, let's just go.
What the hell?
No, no, no.
I'm gonna kick this guy's ass.
No, no.
Don't you...
No, no, no.
Honey, honey!
Hey!
Get in the car, let's just go.
I'm not...
Fine!
Go ahead!
Come on!
Did you get a good look at him?
No, I did not get a good look.
God, I don't wanna do this anymore.
Mick, it's getting too crazy, and I...
Zoe, we need this.
I don't...
I'm out.
We don't need this, Mick.
Do you know what half of $100,000 is?
You know what?
Don't act like I'm an idiot.
Mick, put that gun down!
Jesus Christ.
It's $50,000, Mick!
- That's it!
- That's a lot of money.
I think I'm worth more than $25,000.
That's not what I meant.
Look at you.
This is the zodiac speaking.
This is the zodiac speaking.
This is the zodiac speaking.
This is the zodiac speaking.
Son of a bitch.
- What is it?
- I think he's out there.
This is the zodiac speaking.
God damn it.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Zoe?
Fuck!
Baby...
Fuck you.
Jesus.
No, fuck you!
Don't you fucking come...
Fuck you!
Everything okay?
Do you know who owns this car?
This car?
It's whoever she's sleeping with.
Her in that trailer, what's her name?
Uh...
Come on, you know it.
Spanish name...
Valencia, that's it.
Now, the thing about valencia is, there's a different car here, like, every night.
Although I hate to be judgmental, she's kind of a whore.
I don't know if that helps, does it?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
No.
Hey, baby.
You know I'm sorry.
You pointed a gun in my face, that's not okay.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
And, obviously, sorry isn't cutting it, I...
I know I messed up.
That's an understatement.
Messed up bad, but, baby, I swear,
I heard something.
Zoe, I need you.
I do, I can't do this without you.
Can we please just go see if Harvey's figured out the cipher key?
Hmm?
Maybe he has.
Maybe this is all over already.
And if it doesn't pan out,
I'll work our way out of this.
I promise, no more storage lockers, no more nothing.
I promise you.
I will give you one more day.
Ah, shit.
Come on in, close the door.
Shut the door!
Fast!
Jesus.
Just shut it.
Holy shit, Harvey.
I've almost figured it out.
This fucking dude was a genius, man.
He used a combination of a Caesar, vigenere and pigpen cipher.
Look, I'll explain it to you.
You see this symbol?
All these years, codebreakers have considered this its own character, right?
This one symbol is four letters, but this... this symbol here, this is one letter, shifted with a Caesar cipher.
Like a fucking brainiac, this guy.
Okay, so, I can make some critical assumptions, and I've narrowed it down to suspects that live within a 50-mile radius.
That's only hundreds.
No, no, no.
I think it's Ben ferguson.
No.
Yeah, yeah, he served in the military.
He was in San Fran between '67 and '69.
Mick, Mick, you're like everybody else.
You're trying to fit the evidence to the suspect.
That's not how you do it.
It's not Ben ferguson.
I don't know how many fucking times I have to say that.
Don't even try, he won't even listen.
Mick, his name doesn't even fit in the cipher.
I just need some more time.
I kind of just, like, fell asleep for an hour, but if I can get one more symbol,
I can eliminate 97% of these names, okay?
I can't do it with you guys here, though.
You need to...
All right.
I need to be alone, so...
Can ya pick me up a sandwich, or something?
I'm fucking starving.
All right, great.
Yeah.
Harvey seems like he's losing it.
Yeah.
I got it.
I got it!
I got it!
It's "e"!
It's fucking "e"!
Okay, okay, okay.
Eliminate those.
Boo-yah!
Do you see that?
Yup.
Don't brake, don't brake.
Mick, please drive.
Drive.
All right.
Holy shit.
You think Tina reported our little break-in?
It's fine, it'll blow over.
Just...
let's go get Harvey his food.
Where's Harvey's Van?
Doubt he'd leave.
By the smell of him, he hasn't left this place in two days.
Can you...
Yes.
Honey, we're home!
Harvey?
We brought you some barbecue.
Where you at?
Harvey?
Whoa!
He split.
What?
He split.
No.
No, no, no.
Not gonna let him get away with this.
He's gonna take the whole reward.
Oh, god.
I knew he'd do something like this.
God damn it.
Oh, Mick.
What a jerk.
Shit.
He's such a jerk.
No, no, no.
It's gonna be fine.
Something in these pages.
He said if he could find, uh, one more of these symbols...
Uh-huh.
He could cut that list down to...
Like a handful, right?
Right?
Yeah, right, right.
Baby, look.
He did it.
He found it.
He figured it out.
Holy shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This...
Okay, I've got a page here with all the names and addresses crossed off.
I got one more.
Oh, good.
One... that's one, two, three.
Okay, hold on.
Here's one not crossed off.
Uh...
Gimme that.
I've got one, too.
Ah!
Here's one crossed off.
What do you got?
How many is that?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... nine.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, baby.
Yeah, all right.
We're not looking for the zodiac now.
Here.
Now...
Thank you.
We're going after Harvey.
You're sure you're up for this?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Okay.
Jesus.
Shit.
What is it?
I don't know.
Ugh, look for some shotgun shells for that thing, okay, hon?
Okay, I got it.
Go.
Hey, Mick, I found some!
Great.
Mick!
Mick, Harvey just took off!
Get down here!
Hang on.
Zoe.
Honey, he's getting away!
Shit.
Damn it!
Zoe!
Jesus!
Zoe!
Mick?
Zoe.
Okay, listen to me.
Harvey...
No, no, listen to me.
I can see Harvey's Van right in front of me, okay?
I love you.
Just come get me.
Bye!
No, no, no, Harvey's dead!
Fuck!
Where are the goddamn keys?
Come on.
Hey, it's Zoe.
Leave a...
Damn it.
Come on, Zoe.
Pick up.
Hey, it's Zoe.
Leave a message.
Damn it!
Come on.
Come on.
Where are you?
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Damn it.
911.
State your emergency.
My wife's been abducted.
What is your name, sir, and what is your location?
Yeah, I'm Mick Bradley.
I'm at 1228 cherry street.
A man is dead.
Sir, calm down.
There's a unit on its way.
Okay, okay.
Harvey!
Don't move!
What are you doing, man?
Harvey, don't play games with me...
I got a big-ass gun, Harvey, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Come on!
Laurel.
Laurel.
Zoe?
This is the zodiac speaking.
I have your wife.
She doesn't have to die.
You listen to me.
Don't you fucking touch her, I'll...
You'll what?
You do not have control here.
The police do.
The police are, what?
On their way?
Oh, then I guess she's going to have to die.
No, no.
Don't, don't, don't.
They don't know anything.
And?
And I have the film reel.
Good.
Well, then perhaps there is hope for her yet.
Zoe, is it?
Please, don't.
I assume that as you have made it this far, you know how to find me.
You must be very proud.
Fuck you.
After all these years, after all the police departments and the FBI profilers and programmers, all looking for me, they all come up empty.
But you, you found me.
Now, go figure.
Why?
Well, you have my films.
Now, I quit.
Cold Turkey.
For 40 years.
You have no idea the monumental effort that that took.
But I got away scot-free.
Except for Ben, of course.
He got close.
Him I had to follow.
I followed him all the way from San Francisco.
I was gonna kill him, but I grew to like it here.
Now, that fat-ass woman, she sold my locker.
I missed two payments.
My memory ain't what it used to be.
Too bad.
I wanna tell you something.
This is my story.
You're not gonna destroy my legend.
I left you a way out if you're brave enough to try.
You know, they herded a lot of young animals through here on their last journey.
And they designed this place to ease their anxiety as they herded them to the slaughter.
I don't think it's gonna have the same effect on you.
It's gonna hurt, but what can I say?
Enjoy.
Oh, your husband's on his way.
I'm gonna kill him first.
No!
No!
God.
Fuck!
Ow!
God damn it!
Come on, baby, come on.
Come on.
All right, there it is.
There it is.
Forty-five.
.38 caliber.
Holy shit, it fits.
Come on!
Where is she?
Oh, she's fine.
I need to see the reel.
You put down your goddamn gun!
I need to see the film!
Okay.
Fuck.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ow!
By golly, I nailed him.
No, you...
Zoe?
- Zoe?
- Mick?
Mick, baby, I'm over here!
Shit.
Mick, he's in here.
Where is he?
Mick, help!
Mick!
Mick!
Mick, Mick, Mick!
Jesus Christ.
We gotta get out of here somewhere.
I know.
We have to get out of here.
Go!
Go!
Go, baby!
Go!
Ahh!
Fuck.
Fuck you!
Get the fuck...
Fuck!
Don't move!
Don't fucking move!
Well, this is not gonna end well for you.
I will shoot that fucking smile off your fucking face, grandpa,
I swear to god, I will.
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
A lot of people have tried.
Shut up!
Put me out of my misery.
Go ahead, do it now!
By golly,
I wish this could go on forever.
Zoe!
Mick.
Mick.
Behind you!
God... come here.
Oh, my god.
After four weeks of investigation, the FBI, with the cooperation of the local authorities, using DNA evidence, have positively linked the deceased to the three local homicides.
We have been unable to make a positive identification on the deceased.
We are currently investigating those scenes and his residence for any other pertinent evidence.
The investigation is ongoing, but I can tell you at this time we cannot exclude or confirm the DNA of the now deceased suspect as a match for the zodiac killer.
After 40 years, the earlier samples are just unreliable.
I know there's a lot of families out there that are looking for some closure, but, uh, it's gonna take a long, long time before we know for sure.
I'll take your questions now.
- Shit.
Hey.
- What?
Mick?
What's wrong?
What is it?
No, baby.
It's just me just being my clumsy self.
Have I been sleeping?
You've been asleep for a long time.
Sorry.
It's okay, come here.
Come here.
Come sit with me.
It's going to be all right.
There you go.
Oh... yeah, look at us.
Hey, so, frank came by today.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He offered me my old job at the mill.
Even some extra hours doing security.
Did you take it?
Hell, yeah, I did.
That's good.
Mm.
It's time to make a real go of things, baby.
You mean the world to me.
What's wrong with that light?
It's just... it's a light.
It's always like that.
You know, it just needs a good kicking.
We gotta...
We should fix it.
I'll tell ya what,
I'm gonna go fix it right now, okay?
No, no, no, please stay here.
Just please stay here.
Baby, baby, it's okay.
It's okay.
I got this, all right?
I don't want you to go.
I'll be back in a second, okay?
Hey, I love you.
Just breathe.
Mick?
Mick?
Mick!
Mick?

Someone's coming.
Shit.
Who is it?
Beats me, I can't see anything.
This is freaking me out, Adam, you said that no one ever comes up here.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
POLICE OFFICER:
Are you okay, ma'am?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, Officer.
I suppose you gave us a bit of a scare.
There's no parking here after sundown.
Sorry, Officer.
You been drinking, son?
Mama said never to drink on a first date.
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER)
First date, very nice.
All right.
You kids get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Officer.
Sorry, Officer.
(EXHALES)
Oh, boy, what a drag.
You are so lucky he didn't bust you for drinking.
Yeah, he had no right.
Besides, only park rangers can ticket you in these parts.
(LAUGHS) You are so full of it.
(CAR IGNITION STARTS)
Come on.
This guy is just dying to give us a ticket.
(SIGHS)
What the hell is he doing?
God damn.
No, Adam.
You're such an idiot!
Officer, I don't know what you think I was doing, but...
Hey, you're not the...
What the hell is that?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, mister, I'm talking to you!
LULA:
No, Adam!
(ADAM GROANING IN PAIN)
Please, no, we didn't do anything wrong!
Run, Lula!
Run!

Help!
Help!

(MAN GROANS IN PAIN)
(GUNSHOT)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey, honey, I'm home.
Hey.
Hey.
What did you do with the, uh, grocery money?
And how was your day?
Let me tell you a little bit about mine.
It was great.
You want one?
Where'd it all go?
To our future.
Harvey won us the bid on that storage locker.
Oh, God, another one?
(EXHALES SHARPLY) You know, it's your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your future, Zoe.
What?
That's a quote by your Anthony Robbins.
(LAUGHS) You didn't even read that book.
Maybe a little.
Oh, my God.
Baby, we got that riding mower, remember?
We sold that for a good buck, and then what about that storage locker with all that silverware?
We made out like bandits on that.
Mick, that's two, what about all the other ones?
Oh, Lord Jesus.
Okay, what did you end up paying for this one?
(CLICKS TONGUE) 1,200 What?
$1,200?
Yeah.
Mick, that's three months' rent.
Harv and I split it, so...
I'm gonna kill you right now.
(GRUNTING) I'm mad at you, we can't...
Mick, we're never gonna get out of this shitbox betting on storage lockers.
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
I mean...
Oh, God.
It's not what I'm saying, it's what you're saying.
You sit there, and you sit there, and go,
"Oh, Zoe, I wanna give you a better life."
"Oh, Zoe, I wanna actually give you a real house one day."
But I'm the only grown-up standing here in the room, and I don't wanna be the grown-up.
Don't even, don't even.
No, no, no, no, no, just...
What?
This is your special spot, your special spot.
(LAUGHS) I hate you so much right now.
What do we own now?
Well, let's go talk to Harvey, and check it out, right?
You're so rotten.
Stop it.
Get outta here.
(SNIFFING)
Come on, babe.
MICK:
So, Tina, she was the one who tipped us off.
She said it was owned by some rich old woman.
And I ain't talking like, living in a trailer with a Caddy in the driveway kind of rich,
I'm talking more like RealHousewivesof Atlantakindof rich.
Baby, we got to take this thing in before it completely craps out on us, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Just as soon as we can pay for it.
Cut me some slack.
I didn't say anything!
I'm just trying to dig us out of this rut.
(LAUGHING) Do you have a bulldozer?
Pfft.
Man, you know I'm ain't programed to take shit from nobody.
It ain't in my genes.
Is having a roof over your head in your genes?
How much money do you think you've actually made on these lockers over the past two years?
I don't know, a little over $1,000.
So, you just threw most of that back today on one locker.
That's all I'm saying.
My sister's got it better than us, and she's in jail.
Hot damn, you serious?
(MICK LAUGHS)
I got a good feeling about this one, okay?
Oh, baby, you always do.
I got a good feeling about this one.
You always do.
HARVEY:
Come on, get in here.
Jesus, Harvey.
You look like shit.
Diggity.
Hot diggity.
Aw, now, there's a ray of sunshine.
Where have you been?
Oh, hey, Harvey.
Hey, you know what?
You get prettier and prettier every time I see ya.
Don't try to sweet talk me, where's all the crap you guys bought?
It's that pile right there.
Hey, you want a beer?
Sure.
Man, you look like you haven't slept.
Wow!
I haven't.
So, this is it?
Yeah, well, those are the best pieces.
That's, uh, like, I don't know, 300 bucks, and we got some stuff back in the locker, $100, $120.
So, we're talking $400, $425 for the whole lot.
$425 for the whole thing?
Whoo!
Hold on, hold on.
Tina's never steered us wrong before.
Well, honey, looks like you guys got screwed like a 10-cent whore on nickel night.
HARVEY:
No, no, no.
I was going through those boxes there, and I found something.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Follow me.
It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser.
Come here, check this out.
Home movies?
They're dated.
09-27-69.
Oh, great, so, now you're the proud owners of somebody's 40-year-old wedding movies.
No, not a wedding.
I watched them.
Follow me.
Up here.
(ZOE GRUNTS)
Go in straight, and then to your right.
Oh, real classy, Harv.
Don't fucking touch that.
That's collector's edition.
How do you keep inventory of all this crap?
Oh, Christ, Harvey.
HARVEY:
I got a photographic memory.
I think you have a concussion right about now.
(SIGHS)
Hey, let's watch some movies!
What do you keep in here, a dead body?
(GASPS)
Oh, Jesus.
You okay?
Can we just go?
Yeah, let's, uh...
Harv?
Harvey?
Harvey?
Here.
(SCREAMS)
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
ZOE:
Okay, so, home movies.
I really hope this gets better, Harv.
Just keep watching.
Shit.
What happened?
(SNIFFING)
Uh, this film, it's just really old and degraded.
It's okay, I saw it.
Is it ruined?
What was it?
Can you just hold your panties?
I'll hold my panties.
(SIGHS)
I'm just gonna put in the second reel.
Just have some patience.
Here we go.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
This one's hard to watch.
Whoa!
What the hell is this, Harv?
(PROJECTOR CLICKS OFF)
It's the Zodiac.
Zodiac?
Yeah, that's why I stayed up all night researching this shit.
This guy claims to have killed 37 people.
Only, the cops confirmed five.
Holy shit.
HARVEY:
Here.
He taunted the police with letters containing ciphers that to this day have gone unsolved.
Not even the FBI have been able to solve them.
(TYPING)
There he is.
That's our guy in the film.
Jesus Christ.
MICK:
I've seen that picture before.
The numbers on these cans.
09-27-69.
Punch that in, babe.
(TYPING)
"Napa, California.
Cecelia Shepard attacked on..."
"September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of Lake Berryessa.
"Shepard died of her wounds."
See, what'd I tell ya?
What are the other dates on those?
06-18-68.
ZOE: 06-18-68.
Nothing.
All right.
Try 08-31-68.
08-31-68.
Nope.
HARVEY:
Search "murders."
He was never caught.
The search for the Zodiac Killer has been like the search for the fucking Holy Grail.
HARVEY:
Here you go.
Okay.
First of all, you don't even know if those are real, and second, you should let the police handle this.
That's what I would do.
How is any of this stuff in an old lady's locker?
Maybe it wasn't an old lady's locker.
Mick, think about it, you'd never store evidence like this in your own name, right?
MICK:
Well...
"San Francisco Police Department re-opens Zodiac case."
Which is exactly why you call the police.
No, no, you're not looking close enough.
Look where it says, "Reward for evidence leading to the Zodiac Killer."
$100,000.
Boo-yah!
Divine intervention.
Come on, baby.
This could be my ticket to Costa Rica.
You guys are nuts.
Zoe, there are a million theories on the Internet that the Zodiac filmed his kills.
I've seen my fair share of America'sMostWanted.
This is not enough evidence to prove anything.
No, you're absolutely right.
All we have to do is find out who they belong to, and then we have something worth 100,000 fucking dollars.
ZOE:
Hey, Mick?
I gotta go, I gotta go do, um, Ellie's hair.
I'll be in the vehicle.
She'll be fine.
She's been this way since Freda closed the salon.
Are you sure we can make some money off this thing?
I don't know, man, but I do know that that's the guy on the film.
Here.
You take it, you put it in a safe place because these could be our meal tickets.
We go 50-50, you want to do this with me.
Come on, man.
We already know where the first stop is, right?
Fifty-fifty.
Fiddy-fiddy.
$50,000 each.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
Evening, Ray.
(SNORING)
Good night, Ray.
(CONTINUES SNORING)
Baby.
Come on, come to bed.
We can talk about this tomorrow.
Um, there's nothing to talk about.
It's a lot of money.
Do you hear yourself, Mick?
Because you are talking, um, about a serial killer, so...
I know.
Good.
So, there's nothing to talk about.
Baby, I get a vote in this, too.
We are talking about $100,000.
Mick, I let you convince me to move to this shitty town.
MICK:
Oh...
I let you convince me to sell my mama's jewelry to pay rent and pay the bills...
Hey, hey, what'd you want me to do?
You were out of work.
That's not fair because I am doing my part in this, okay?
I did Ellie today, I have somebody tomorrow...
And that helps, but, baby, I am not making shit mowing lawns and throwing out trash.
So, your solution is hunting a serial killer for a reward?
It's $100,000.
Good night.
(LAWNMOWER HUMMING)
(KIDS GIGGLING)
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Hey, baby.
You left without saying goodbye.
I know, you were sleeping and I didn't want to wake you.
Look, Mick, I don't want to fight with you.
Neither do I.
Ican'tbelieveI'm abouttosaythis, but,um...
Oh ,LordJesus.
If you honestly think this thing is legit, then let's do it.
Are you sure you're up for this?
No, but that's real money, and we're running out of options.
This could be the one we're been waiting for, baby.
I hope so.
All right, let me check back in with Harvey then.
Great, love you.
Love you, too.
All right.
TINA:
This is Tina.
Uh-huh.
MAN:
Tina, why'dyouchangethe lock onmylocker?
Igottagetinthere...
I've heard it all before, honey.
Just come by the office tomorrow and make a partial payment, okay?
Allright.
All right.
(HUMMING)
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Oh, jeez.
(DOOR BUZZES)
All right, Harv, we're in.
You mean Zoe said yes?
Oh, shut up, and let's just get to work.
(LAUGHS) Shut up, Harvey.
What is that smell?
Yes, this is perchlorethylene.
It's like a pedicure for this old film.
It, like, pulls off any sludge and restores moisture.
Yeah, so, it won't burn up again.
Huh.
Well, aren't you a trick.
You should give me your reel, so I can clean it up.
Oh, our reel is doing just fine, Harv.
Well, I hope you have it hid good 'cause it's half the key to our fortune.
We heard you the first time, Harv.
It's taken care of.
We're gonna talk to Tina at the U-Store-All.
Yep.
And find out who actually rented this locker.
HARVEY:
Oh, good idea.
Now, I wanna see the rest of that crap we bought.
(WOMAN SOBBING)
(MUFFLED SCREAM)
(CAMERA BEEPS)
(SCREAMING)
(GAGGING)
ZOE:
All right.
Which one is it?
MICK:
This one right here.
What the hell?
Where's all the crap?
I sure as hell hope Tina moved it.
Ugh!
What the hell?
Ugh...
She's always here.
Tina, it's Mick.
Where are you?
I need to get some things.
Call me back ASAP, huh?
Yeah, I don't get this.
She's always here.
Honey, I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure she just ran out to get a bite to eat or something.
God damn it.
Jeez.
What, are you gonna go in, guns-a-blazing?
Break in the joint?
I don't know, maybe just have a look around.
Oh, no, oh.
Oh, my God.
This is a very bad idea.
Get down.
(WHISPERS) Okay, this is perfect.
Okay.
Okay, what are we doing?
This is the locker number.
I want you to check the computer, I'll check the filing cabinets.
You realize that you seem oddly comfortable with all of this.
Honey, we haven't been out of the trailer in months.
This is the most excitement I've had in years.
I'll tell what, if you play your cards right and don't say anything mean, you might just get lucky tonight.
Oh, is that right?
That is right.
Okay, get to work.
Yeah.
I mean, I wouldn't mind some...
Get to work!
All right.
Okay.
Files are labeled under customer names.
Yeah, mine, too.
What about customers who haven't paid their bills or...
Yeah, arrears.
Yeah.
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Okay, it's a long list.
It's a woman.
It's under a woman's name.
Okay.
Okay, that's gotta cut it down.
Um, you ready?
Yeah.
Try "Hilly Martino."
Hilly Martino.
All right, found it.
That is locker number 84.
Oh, that's not it.
Okay...
Um, Elsa Carlingson.
Elsa...
Yeah, nope.
Okay, Betty Ferguson.
Betty Ferguson.
Betty Ferguson.
Locker number 45.
We got it.
Shh.
Don't get too excited.
BOTH:
Uh...
Says she hasn't paid in three weeks.
Good Lord.
That's how long before they start selling your stuff?
That's rough.
They're not fucking around at the U-Store-All.
You got an address?
Yup, let's go.
Wait, you mean tonight?
Get the hell outta here.
I don't wanna nose around some serial killer's house in the middle of the night, right?
Copy that.
Copy that.
Right.
This is so crazy.
Tina?
Tina?
Hey, Mick, come on, let's go.
Is that you?
Mick, come on.
Let's go, babe.
Hey!
Mick, come on, let's go.
Please?
Stay in the truck.
I got this.
What are you doing, Mick?
Hey!
Who's there?
I suggest you show your face before I crack it open.
Mick, come on.
No, no, no.
Babe, come on, please?
This is your last warning, bro.
Mick, come on, now!
(HORN HONKS)
Hey.
Honking the horn, seriously?
Let's go.
You fucking crazy?
I'm not the one sitting there holding the shovel in his hands.
Let's get out of here.
Who was that guy?
God!
I don't know, but I wanna call Harv, share our intel, huh?
Please, lock your door.
Oh, my God.
(SQUEALS) That was crazy!
I can't believe we did that.
Hot damn.
That was amazing.
That was nuts.
That was a whole lotta crazy.
You're a whole lotta crazy.
(GIGGLES) You're crazy.
Thank you.
Off.
Yes.
Off.
My hands are stuck, my hands are stuck.
It's okay, I'll take them outta there.
(GIGGLING)
(DOOR CREAKS OPEN)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(FLOORBOARDS CREAK)
It's okay.
(FRIDGE DOOR OPENS)
Oh, Jesus Christ, Ray.
Oh, sorry, man, didn't mean to wake you up, just ran out of beer.
You scared the shit out of me.
Do you know what time it is?
Sorry, Mick.
Oh, it's all right.
(EXHALES) I can't sleep, anyway.
Grab me one of those, will ya?
You know, you can't keep coming in unannounced like that.
Probably get your head bashed in one of these days.
Okay.
But why so edgy, hasn't ever much bothered you before.
We're in the midst of a thing.
Can't really say.
RAY:
Oh!
Okay.
Listen, I know it's none of my business, but can I give you some advice?
Yeah.
Don't mess around with shit you don't understand.
Shit you don't know nothing about.
What are you talking about?
I seen all that Zodiac Killer shit on your table in there.
You're right, it ain't any of your damn business.
There's boundaries, Ray.
I don't mind you taking a beer every now and then, but don't be going through my shit, dude.
I was there.
Where?
San Fran-fucking-cisco.
I was there in the '60s.
That man you're so interested in?
He brought that town to its knees.
He struck fear in the hearts of every single law-abiding citizen in that town.
We was all shitting our pants.
Mommy and Daddy didn't wanna send Junior to school.
The mailman was worried he was gonna get blown to pieces.
For crying out loud, the cops were walking their beats like they were frightened little schoolgirls just waiting to get picked off on their sidewalks.
'Cause nobody was safe.
Totally unpredictable.
Beautiful.
That man's an absolute genius, the way he evaded the law all this time.
Do you realize that?
There's never ever gonna be another man like him, not never.
You sound like a fan.
Bunch of theories about where he might've got to now.
Some think he might still be alive.
So, do yourself a favor.
Just take my advice, burn that film.
Forget what you seen, get on with your life, 'cause I promise you, nothing good's gonna come from this.
How do you know about the film?
Ah, there's no secret these cardboard walls can keep.
I gotta go.
I got some things I gotta take care of.
At this hour?
I gotta get up early.
Yeah.
Anyway, thanks for the beer.
I'm taking it to go.
All right, dude.
Yeah, baby?
I think it's just...
It's right up here.
Yup.
He's been staked out here all night.
Come on, come on, quick.
Before someone sees you.
Come on.
Quick, quick, quick.
Okay, okay, keep your pants on.
Okay, we are here.
What are we doing?
Now, what do we do?
Knock on her door, tell her her husband's the Zodiac Killer?
I've been scoping this place out for 18 hours, nobody's come or gone or even taken a piss.
I promise you, nobody's in that fucking house, and if they are, they're dead.
Now, by the way, I did some research.
Betty Ferguson, 91 years old, her husband, Balthazar, 94, both alive.
How the hell do you know that?
You owe me 15 bucks for your half.
Ninety-four years old, I mean...
You guys, he probably already has one foot in the grave.
Look, all we gotta do is find a piece of evidence that ties Ferguson to the film, then we call the police.
Boom, done, ka-ching.
The FBI hasn't been able to catch him all these years, what makes you think we're going to find anything?
Is that the shitty attitude we're going to start with?
Maybe.
How is that a shitty attitude?
Because you're, like, "I don't wanna do this..."
Okay, ladies, ladies.
Ladies, you're both pretty, let's get to work.
Can you open the door?
I thought Tina told you that this lady was loaded?
Oh, shit.
You all right?
I'm fine, go.
Whoa!
We're not going in there.
(DOOR CLICKS OPEN)
Worry not, my sweet.
The good Lord is watching over you.
We keep making a habit of this.
Well, we're here.
Opportunity has opened its door.
(DOOR CLOSES)
ZOE:
This looks like a haunted house.
HARVEY:
That's good.
See, I told you, nobody's here.
Boo!
(SHRIEKS)
(LAUGHS)
Wow!
What exactly are we looking for?
Anything.
Everything.
Just keep your eyes open.
ZOE:
Hey.
You think this is Balthazar, or do you think they had a son?
MICK:
I can't tell.
Look at this.
Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco.
Where the murders took place.
So, this...
Yeah.
This has to be their son.
That has to be Balthazar.
HARVEY:
Guys, come down here.
Guys, down here.
Watch your step.
Look at this.
ZOE:
What?
What?
What?
Come here.
8mm camera.
Oh...
This could be the fucking camera.
ZOE:
And I found a picture of Balthazar's son in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
Okay, look, there's gotta be a film reel here.
Just look.
Like, look for a canister.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
(THUMP)
Shh.
(CREAKING)
(WHISPERS) Did you hear that?
Yes.
Yes.
(CREAKING)
(FOOTSTEPS)
(DOOR CREAKS OPENS)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)
(DOOR SHUTS)
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, he's gone.
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Listen to me, you keep your shit together.
No, you keep your shit together.
You're crazy.
We have to find a reel, let's get a reel.
Two minutes, please?
Come on.
He left.
Let's go.
Hurry up, there's gotta be one here.
(CLATTERING)
Shh.
Found it.
Harv?
No way.
Now, can we please go?
I'll only be one second.
(ZOE COUGHS)
(WHISPERS) Can we please go now?
Come on.
Come on.
It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, we're clear.
Come on.
Hey!
(GUN COCKS)
Christ.
Put it down, or I'll blow your head clean off your neck.
I can't do that, sir.
Okay, take it easy.
No one needs to get hurt, for God's sake.
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my house?
Are you Balthazar Ferguson?
I'm his son, Benjamin.
What are you doing here?
Uh...
You know, um, we didn't mean to barge in, but your door was open.
We just...
We bought your mama's storage locker, and we found this, um, film reel.
And we thought, "You know what?
Maybe they might want it back."
I don't understand.
They've lived in Florida for the past few years.
Take a look at this place.
Does it look like they needed a storage locker?
Oh, so, you live here by yourself now?
You guys sure do ask a lot of questions while you're staring down the barrel of a gun.
(STAMMERING)
We're gonna go.
So, thank you, sir.
So sorry.
Let's go, guys.
All right, we're going.
Take it easy.
BENJAMIN:
Stop.
I think you forgot something.
What's that?
The film, just hand it over.
Well, if it isn't your mother's locker, then it's probably not her film.
Yeah, so sorry.
Really, really sorry.
Just, um...
Okay, take care.
Come on.
Ben, everything all right over there?
Yeah, fine.
These folks were just leaving.
Once again, our apologies, sir.
Yeah.
Here's my card.
If you find anything else you think might belong to me...
Try calling next time.
Will do.
ZOE:
Take care!
Didn't catch your name.
Y'all have a nice day.
Bye-bye.
(HARVEY CLEARS THROAT)
Oh!
God, creepy.
MICK:
How could you just hand it to him?
That film could have sealed the deal.
Are you serious?
What was I supposed to do, run?
Seriously, you guys, what if that was really the guy and I didn't give him the film?
(SCOFFING)
What?
He would've just killed us right there?
Yeah.
That was the guy.
Yeah, it had to have been.
HARVEY:
No, it wasn't.
Harvey?
Are you serious?
What are the chances he'd have a camera and a roll of 8mm film?
And there was the photo of him in San Francisco by the Golden Gate Bridge.
And he worked for a newspaper, which they always thought.
ZOE:
He's the right age.
And it was his storage locker.
And he had a fucking gun in our face.
Why would he let the locker go?
He's old, maybe he just forgot.
Well...
You guys, we gotta go back.
We gotta lift prints, or do something like that.
Lift some prints?
That's my girl, yeah.
You guys been watching too many CSI:
Miami re-runs.
Trust me, he's not our guy.
He didn't have that killer look.
That killer look?
HARVEY:
Yeah, no joke.
I saw it in Kuwait.
You know, some soldiers, they live for the action, others were scared shitless, and then there were the stone-cold fucking killers.
When you watch a man kill another man, and then he turns and looks at you, his eyes soft, relaxed, almost satisfied, you know you're in the presence of a real killer.
That other reel should be dry by now.
I'll meet you back at my place, yeah?
Yeah, okay.
(SNIFFLES)
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
Wait, what was that?
Looked like a cipher key.
A what?
What?
Remember I told you that he sent letters to the newspapers in code?
Yeah.
Just watch.
Right after he passes the gun, right before he wipes the blood off the knife.
That paper with the symbols on it.
ZOE:
What do you see?
I think this is a cipher key.
This could be the cipher key.
What are you talking about?
Code-breaking.
The Zodiac, he always claimed that his name was in the cipher.
This could be the fucking key.
(STAMMERING)
I'm sorry, Harv,
I don't understand.
Can you just speak English?
Okay, these kinds of codes, they were used by, like, the CIA and foreign governments to encrypt messages going all the way back to World War II.
Next to each symbol is a letter.
You replace each symbol with the correlating letter, and you have the translation.
I can see that you don't understand.
I'll show you.
I don't understand.
Okay.
What does that say?
MICK:
It's symbols.
Right.
Now, this is a cipher key.
"E" has a corresponding square.
"O" has an upside-down triangle.
"Z" has a "V."
This reads "Zoe." "Zoe."
It's easy if you have the key.
Almost impossible if you don't.
Oh, man.
This could be the key to the 340.
What's the 340?
It's the unsolved cipher.
The 408 was broken.
MICK:
How do you know all this shit?
Two tours, special ops, remember?
They taught you code-breaking in Kuwait?
Oh, yeah, it's like the ABCs of electronic intelligence, but back in the day, code-breaking was like basic training.
ZOE:
Think you could crack it?
If this is a cipher key, fucking A.
Okay.
HARVEY:
I gotta get into this.
Why don't you guys check on Ben's history?
Like, go to Town Hall and newspapers and see if he has a military record.
Because this shit here is military 101.
Done.
Yeah?
My coat, thanks.
ZOE:
Hey, Harvey, good one.
Hey, by the way, bring me your reel in the morning.
I wanna put it in my safe.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
ZOE:
Babe, Harvey wouldn't screw us over.
He's a good guy, right?
MICK:
I don't know.
Let me just drop you off at Town Hall and I'll go hide the film.
ZOE:
Wait, are you saying you don't trust him either?
Let's just say I wanna make sure we get our half.
Smart boy.
Yup.
Hey.
Um...
Call you when I'm done?
Careful.
Love ya.
Love ya!
Thank you.
Beautiful.
(DOG BARKING)
Oh... (GRUNTS SOFTLY)
RECEPTIONIST:
Tri-CountyNewsLedger.
Yes, no problem.
Thank you.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Hey, excuse me?
Hi.
Um...
These only go back to 1980.
Where would I find articles dating back to the late '60s?
Archives is in the basement.
ZOE:
Oh.
For employees only.
Um...
Polly, it's kind of important.
I'm sorry, we're about to close.
I bet you are, but it's just that I was...
Um...
I've been at city records, and couldn't find what I was looking for over there and it would be so helpful...
Miss, I can't help you.
(PHONE RINGING)
Tri-CountyNewsLedger.
Hey, Polly.
Yes, he is.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he is.
Okay, I'll let him know.
Thanks, Polly.
Thank you.
Thank you, Polly!
Okay.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Yup.
(BEEPING)
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
(SIGHS)
Hello.
(RUMBLING)
(BREATHING HEAVY)
God damn it.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
(STATIC)
Hello?
(BANG)
(PHONE BEEPS)
"The Zodiac has fled the West Coast, leaving behind a trail
"of unsolved murders across the country.
"I have provided authorities with
"new evidence from an unnamed source
"that I believe will eventually
"lead to the identity of the elusive killer."
(ELEVATOR DINGS, RUMBLES)
(PAPERS SHUFFLING)
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, Mick.
Um, Mick, it's me.
Listen, I'm at the paper.
I need you to come get me because I think I found something good.
Um...
Okay, I'm here.
Come get me, now.
Okay, bye.
Shit.
(PANTS)
(SCREAMS)
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Oh, God!
Shit!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
(ZOE BREATHING HEAVILY)
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.
Um...
Okay, Ferguson.
Um...
He was an only child.
He was born and raised here.
He was never married.
He never had kids.
Uh, he served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1964.
Zodiac's first kill was 1968.
Then after Vietnam, in 1965, he got a job with a paper in San Francisco as a crime reporter.
San Francisco?
Oh, this is good.
Yeah.
Okay, but there's just a little hitch in the giddy-up.
So, for some reason, Ferguson decided to leave that job with that paper in San Francisco and move back here to start a job with the old Ledger on, um, October the 1st, 1969.
The thing is, Paul Lee Stine was killed in San Francisco on October 11th, 1969.
Shit.
Told you.
So, listen,
I know he's weird, but he can't be our guy because he was here, 2,500 miles away.
But listen to this,
I found an article that Ferguson wrote about Zodiac.
And Ferguson was tracking this string of murders across the country, and he had come up with this theory that Zodiac was actually making his way across the country to here.
So, maybe Ferguson was actually onto the Zodiac, and maybe the Zodiac is still here now.
Or he was leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for the police to follow.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
Why aren't you listening to me?
Shit, I don't know.
Some people say he didn't even live in San Fran.
What people?
I read it on a fan site.
He has fans?
Apparently.
Lots of them.
Do you see a guy?
Feels like there's a guy just parked behind us.
I'm probably...
Let's get out of here.
Babe, let's just go.
What the hell?
No, no, no.
I'm gonna kick this guy's ass.
No, no.
Don't you...
No, no, no.
Honey, honey!
Hey!
Get in the car, let's just go.
I'm not...
Fine!
Go ahead!
Come on!
MICK:
Did you get a good look at him?
ZOE:
No, I did not get a good look.
(TRAILER DOOR OPENS)
(TRAILER DOOR CLOSES)
God, I don't wanna do this anymore.
Mick, it's getting too crazy, and I...
Zoe, we need this.
I don't...
I'm out.
We don't need this, Mick.
(STAMMERING)
Do you know what half of $100,000 is?
You know what?
Don't act like I'm an idiot.
Mick, put that gun down!
Jesus Christ.
It's $50,000, Mick!
That's it!
MICK:
That's a lot of money.
I think I'm worth more than $25,000.
That's not what I meant.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Look at you.
MAN: (ON LAPTOP) ThisistheZodiacspeaking.
ThisistheZodiacspeaking.
(BANG)
ThisistheZodiacspeaking.
ThisistheZodiacspeaking.
Son of a bitch.
ZOE:
What is it?
MICK:
I think he's out there.
ThisistheZodiacspeaking.
God damn it.
(WIND CHIMES CHIMING)
(GASPS) Jesus!
Fuck...
Zoe?
Fuck!
Baby...
Fuck you.
Jesus.
No, fuck you!
Don't you fucking come...
Fuck you!
Everything okay?
Do you know who owns this car?
This car?
It's whoever she's sleeping with.
Her in that trailer, what's her name?
Uh...
Come on, you know it.
Spanish name...
Valencia, that's it.
Now, the thing about Valencia is, there's a different car here, like, every night.
Although I hate to be judgmental, she's kind of a whore.
I don't know if that helps, does it?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
No.
(BANG)
MICK:
Hey, baby.
You know I'm sorry.
You pointed a gun in my face, that's not okay.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
And, obviously, sorry isn't cutting it, I...
I know I messed up.
ZOE:
That's an understatement.
Messed up bad, but, baby, I swear,
(EXHALES)
I heard something.
Zoe, I need you.
I do, I can't do this without you.
(SCOFFS)
Can we please just go see if Harvey's figured out the cipher key?
Hmm?
Maybe he has.
Maybe this is all over already.
And if it doesn't pan out,
I'll work our way out of this.
I promise, no more storage lockers, no more nothing.
I promise you.
I will give you one more day.
(KNOCKING)
(GUN COCKS)
Ah, shit.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Come on in, close the door.
Shut the door!
Fast!
Jesus.
Just shut it.
Holy shit, Harvey.
I've almost figured it out.
This fucking dude was a genius, man.
He used a combination of a Caesar, Vigenere and Pigpen cipher.
Look, I'll explain it to you.
You see this symbol?
All these years, codebreakers have considered this its own character, right?
This one symbol is four letters, but this...
This symbol here, this is one letter, shifted with a Caesar cipher.
Like a fucking brainiac, this guy.
Okay, so, I can make some critical assumptions, and I've narrowed it down to suspects that live within a 50-mile radius.
That's only hundreds.
No, no, no.
I think it's Ben Ferguson.
No.
Yeah, yeah, he served in the military.
He was in San Fran between '67 and '69.
Mick, Mick, you're like everybody else.
You're trying to fit the evidence to the suspect.
That's not how you do it.
It's not Ben Ferguson.
I don't know how many fucking times I have to say that.
Don't even try, he won't even listen.
Mick, his name doesn't even fit in the cipher.
I just need some more time.
I kind of just, like, fell asleep for an hour, but if I can get one more symbol,
I can eliminate 97% of these names, okay?
I can't do it with you guys here, though.
You need to...
All right.
I need to be alone, so...
Can ya pick me up a sandwich, or something?
I'm fucking starving.
All right, great.
MICK:
Yeah.
ZOE:
Harvey seems like he's losing it.
Yeah.
I got it.
I got it!
I got it!
It's "E"!
It's fucking "E"!
Okay, okay, okay.
Eliminate those.
Boo-yah!
Do you see that?
Yup.
Don't brake, don't brake.
Mick, please drive.
Drive.
All right.
Holy shit.
You think Tina reported our little break-in?
It's fine, it'll blow over.
Just...
Let's go get Harvey his food.
(ENGINE STOPS)
Where's Harvey's van?
Doubt he'd leave.
By the smell of him, he hasn't left this place in two days.
Can you...
Yes.
Honey, we're home!
Harvey?
We brought you some barbecue.
Where you at?
Harvey?
Whoa!
He split.
What?
He split.
No.
No, no, no.
Not gonna let him get away with this.
He's gonna take the whole reward.
Oh, God.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I knew he'd do something like this.
God damn it.
ZOE:
Oh, Mick.
What a jerk.
Shit.
He's such a jerk.
No, no, no.
It's gonna be fine.
Something in these pages.
He said if he could find, uh, one more of these symbols...
Uh-huh.
...he could cut that list down to...
Like a handful, right?
Right?
Yeah, right, right.
Baby, look.
He did it.
He found it.
He figured it out.
Holy shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This...
Okay, I've got a page here with all the names and addresses crossed off.
I got one more.
Oh, good.
One...
That's one, two, three.
Okay, hold on.
Here's one not crossed off.
Uh...
Gimme that.
I've got one, too.
Ah!
Here's one crossed off.
What do you got?
How many is that?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Nine.
All right.
Okay.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Okay, baby.
Yeah, all right.
We're not looking for the Zodiac now.
Here.
Now...
Thank you.
We're going after Harvey.
You're sure you're up for this?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Okay.
(DRIPPING)
Jesus.
Shit.
What is it?
I don't know.
Ugh, look for some shotgun shells for that thing, okay, hon?
Okay, I got it.
Go.
Hey, Mick, I found some!
MICK:
Great.
Mick!
Mick, Harvey just took off!

But you, you found me.
Now, go figure.
Why?
Well, you have my films.
Now, I quit.
(COUGHS)
Cold turkey.
For 40 years.
You have no idea the monumental effort that that took.
But I got away scot-free.
Except for Ben, of course.
He got close.
Him I had to follow.
I followed him all the way from San Francisco.
I was gonna kill him, but I grew to like it here.
Now, that fat-ass woman, she sold my locker.
I missed two payments.

Too bad.

Someone's coming.
Shit.
Who is it?
Beats me, i can't see anything.
This is freaking me out, Adam, you said that no one ever comes up here.
Are you okay, ma'am?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, officer.
I suppose you gave us a bit of a scare.
There's no parking here after sundown.
Sorry, officer.
You been drinking, son?
Mama said never to drink on a first date.
First date, very nice.
All right.
You kids get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, officer.
Sorry, officer.
Oh, boy, what a drag.
You are so lucky he didn't bust you for drinking.
Yeah, he had no right.
Besides, only park rangers can ticket you in these parts.
You are so full of it.
Come on.
This guy is just dying to give us a ticket.
What the hell is he doing?
God damn.
No, Adam.
You're such an idiot!
Officer, I don't know what you think i was doing, but...
Hey, you're not the...
What the hell is that?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, mister, I'm talking to you!
No, Adam!
Please, no, we didn't do anything wrong!
Run, lula!
Run!
Help!
Help!
Hey, honey, I'm home.
Hey.
Hey.
What did you do with the, uh, grocery money?
And how was your day?
Let me tell you a little bit about mine.
It was great.
You want one?
Where'd it all go?
To our future.
Harvey won us the bid on that storage locker.
Oh, god, another one?
You know, it's your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your future, Zoe.
What?
That's a quote by your Anthony Robbins.
You didn't even read that book.
Maybe a little.
Oh, my god.
Baby, we got that riding mower, remember?
We sold that for a good buck, and then what about that storage locker with all that silverware?
We made out like bandits on that.
Mick, that's two, what about all the other ones?
Oh, lord Jesus.
Okay, what did you end up paying for this one?
1,200 what?
$1,200?
Yeah.
Mick, that's three months' rent.
Harv and I split it, so...
I'm gonna kill you right now.
I'm mad at you, we can't...
Mick, we're never gonna get out of this shitbox betting on storage lockers.
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
I mean... oh, god.
It's not what I'm saying, it's what you're saying.
You sit there, and you sit there, and go,
"oh, Zoe, I wanna give you a better life."
"Oh, Zoe, i wanna actually give you a real house one day."
But I'm the only grown-up standing here in the room, and I don't wanna be the grown-up.
Don't even, don't even.
No, no, no, no, no, just...
What?
This is your special spot, your special spot.
I hate you so much right now.
What do we own now?
Well, let's go talk to Harvey, and check it out, right?
You're so rotten.
Stop it.
Get outta here.
Come on, babe.
So, Tina, she was the one who tipped us off.
She said it was owned by some rich old woman.
And I ain't talking like, living in a trailer with a caddy in the driveway kind of rich,
I'm talking more like realhousewivesof Atlantakindof rich.
Baby, we got to take this thing in before it completely craps out on us, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Just as soon as we can pay for it.
Cut me some slack.
I didn't say anything!
I'm just trying to dig us out of this rut.
Do you have a bulldozer?
Pfft.
Man, you know I'm ain't programed to take shit from nobody.
It ain't in my genes.
Is having a roof over your head in your genes?
How much money do you think you've actually made on these lockers over the past two years?
I don't know, a little over $1,000.
So, you just threw most of that back today on one locker.
That's all I'm saying.
My sister's got it better than us, and she's in jail.
Hot damn, you serious?
I got a good feeling about this one, okay?
Oh, baby, you always do.
I got a good feeling about this one.
You always do.
Come on, get in here.
Jesus, Harvey.
You look like shit.
Diggity.
Hot diggity.
Aw, now, there's a ray of sunshine.
Where have you been?
Oh, hey, Harvey.
Hey, you know what?
You get prettier and prettier every time I see ya.
Don't try to sweet talk me, where's all the crap you guys bought?
It's that pile right there.
Hey, you want a beer?
Sure.
Man, you look like you haven't slept.
Wow!
I haven't.
So, this is it?
Yeah, well, those are the best pieces.
That's, uh, like, i don't know, 300 bucks, and we got some stuff back in the locker, $100, $120.
So, we're talking $400, $425 for the whole lot.
$425 for the whole thing?
Whoo!
Hold on, hold on.
Tina's never steered us wrong before.
Well, honey, looks like you guys got screwed like a 10-cent whore on nickel night.
No, no, no.
I was going through those boxes there, and I found something.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Follow me.
It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser.
Come here, check this out.
Home movies?
They're dated.
09-27-69.
Oh, great, so, now you're the proud owners of somebody's 40-year-old wedding movies.
No, not a wedding.
I watched them.
Follow me.
Up here.
Go in straight, and then to your right.
Oh, real classy, harv.
Don't fucking touch that.
That's collector's edition.
How do you keep inventory of all this crap?
Oh, Christ, Harvey.
I got a photographic memory.
I think you have a concussion right about now.
Hey, let's watch some movies!
What do you keep in here, a dead body?
Oh, Jesus.
You okay?
Can we just go?
Yeah, let's, uh...
Harv?
Harvey?
Harvey?
Here.
Okay, so, home movies.
I really hope this gets better, harv.
Just keep watching.
Shit.
What happened?
Uh, this film, it's just really old and degraded.
It's okay, I saw it.
Is it ruined?
What was it?
Can you just hold your panties?
I'll hold my panties.
I'm just gonna put in the second reel.
Just have some Patience.
Here we go.
This one's hard to watch.
Whoa!
What the hell is this, harv?
It's the zodiac.
Zodiac?
Yeah, that's why i stayed up all night researching this shit.
This guy claims to have killed 37 people.
Only, the cops confirmed five.
Holy shit.
Here.
He taunted the police with letters containing ciphers that to this day have gone unsolved.
Not even the FBI have been able to solve them.
There he is.
That's our guy in the film.
Jesus Christ.
I've seen that picture before.
The numbers on these cans.
09-27-69.
Punch that in, babe.
"Napa, California.
Cecelia Shepard attacked on..."
"September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of lake berryessa.
"Shepard died of her wounds."
See, what'd I tell ya?
What are the other dates on those?
06-18-68.
06-18-68.
Nothing.
All right.
Try 08-31-68.
08-31-68.
- Nope.
- Search "murders."
He was never caught.
The search for the zodiac killer has been like the search for the fucking holy grail.
Here you go.
Okay.
First of all, you don't even know if those are real, and second, you should let the police handle this.
That's what I would do.
How is any of this stuff in an old lady's locker?
Maybe it wasn't an old lady's locker.
Mick, think about it, you'd never store evidence like this in your own name, right?
Well...
"San Francisco police department re-opens zodiac case."
Which is exactly why you call the police.
No, no, you're not looking close enough.
Look where it says, "reward for evidence leading to the zodiac killer."
$100,000.
Boo-yah!
Divine intervention.
Come on, baby.
This could be my ticket to Costa Rica.
You guys are nuts.
Zoe, there are a million theories on the Internet that the zodiac filmed his kills.
I've seen my fair share of America'smostwanted.
This is not enough evidence to prove anything.
No, you're absolutely right.
All we have to do is find out who they belong to, and then we have something worth 100,000 fucking dollars.
Hey, Mick?
I gotta go, I gotta go do, um, Ellie's hair.
I'll be in the vehicle.
She'll be fine.
She's been this way since Freda closed the salon.
Are you sure we can make some money off this thing?
I don't know, man, but I do know that that's the guy on the film.
Here.
You take it, you put it in a safe place because these could be our meal tickets.
We go 50-50, you want to do this with me.
Come on, man.
We already know where the first stop is, right?
Fifty-fifty.
Fiddy-fiddy.
$50,000 each.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
Evening, ray.
Good night, ray.
Baby.
Come on, come to bed.
We can talk about this tomorrow.
Um, there's nothing to talk about.
It's a lot of money.
Do you hear yourself, Mick?
Because you are talking, um, about a serial killer, so...
I know.
Good.
So, there's nothing to talk about.
Baby, I get a vote in this, too.
We are talking about $100,000.
Mick, I let you convince me to move to this shitty town.
Oh...
I let you convince me to sell my mama's jewelry to pay rent and pay the bills...
Hey, hey, what'd you want me to do?
You were out of work.
That's not fair because I am doing my part in this, okay?
I did Ellie today, i have somebody tomorrow...
And that helps, but, baby, i am not making shit mowing lawns and throwing out trash.
So, your solution is hunting a serial killer for a reward?
It's $100,000.
Good night.
Hey, baby.
You left without saying goodbye.
I know, you were sleeping and I didn't want to wake you.
Look, Mick, I don't want to fight with you.
Neither do I.
Ican'tbelieveI'm abouttosaythis, but,um...oh ,lordJesus.
If you honestly think this thing is legit, then let's do it.
Are you sure you're up for this?
No, but that's real money, and we're running out of options.
This could be the one we're been waiting for, baby.
I hope so.
All right, let me check back in with Harvey then.
Great, love you.
Love you, too.
All right.
This is Tina.
Uh-huh.
Tina, why'dyouchangethe lock onmylocker?
Igottagetinthere...
I've heard it all before, honey.
Just come by the office tomorrow and make a partial payment, okay?
Allright.
All right.
Oh, jeez.
All right, harv, we're in.
You mean Zoe said yes?
Oh, shut up, and let's just get to work.
Shut up, Harvey.
What is that smell?
Yes, this is perchlorethylene.
It's like a pedicure for this old film.
It, like, pulls off any sludge and restores moisture.
Yeah, so, it won't burn up again.
Huh.
Well, aren't you a trick.
You should give me your reel, so I can clean it up.
Oh, our reel is doing just fine, harv.
Well, I hope you have it hid good 'cause it's half the key to our fortune.
We heard you the first time, harv.
It's taken care of.
We're gonna talk to Tina at the u-store-all.
Yep.
And find out who actually rented this locker.
Oh, good idea.
Now, I wanna see the rest of that crap we bought.
All right.
Which one is it?
This one right here.
What the hell?
Where's all the crap?
I sure as hell hope Tina moved it.
Ugh!
What the hell?
Ugh...
She's always here.
Tina, it's Mick.
Where are you?
I need to get some things.
Call me back asap, huh?
Yeah, I don't get this.
She's always here.
Honey, I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure she just ran out to get a bite to eat or something.
God damn it.
Jeez.
What, are you gonna go in, guns-a-blazing?
Break in the joint?
I don't know, maybe just have a look around.
Oh, no, oh.
Oh, my god.
This is a very bad idea.
Get down.
Okay, this is perfect.
Okay.
Okay, what are we doing?
This is the locker number.
I want you to check the computer, I'll check the filing cabinets.
You realize that you seem oddly comfortable with all of this.
Honey, we haven't been out of the trailer in months.
This is the most excitement I've had in years.
I'll tell what, if you play your cards right and don't say anything mean, you might just get lucky tonight.
Oh, is that right?
That is right.
Okay, get to work.
Yeah.
I mean, i wouldn't mind some...
Get to work!
All right.
Okay.
Files are labeled under customer names.
Yeah, mine, too.
What about customers who haven't paid their bills or...
Yeah, arrears.
Yeah.
Okay, it's a long list.
It's a woman.
It's under a woman's name.
Okay.
Okay, that's gotta cut it down.
Um, you ready?
Yeah.
Try "hilly martino."
Hilly martino.
All right, found it.
That is locker number 84.
Oh, that's not it.
Okay...
Um, Elsa carlingson.
Elsa... yeah, nope.
Okay, Betty ferguson.
Betty ferguson.
Betty ferguson.
Locker number 45.
We got it.
Shh.
Don't get too excited.
Uh...
Says she hasn't paid in three weeks.
Good lord.
That's how long before they start selling your stuff?
That's rough.
They're not fucking around at the u-store-all.
You got an address?
Yup, let's go.
Wait, you mean tonight?
Get the hell outta here.
I don't wanna nose around some serial killer's house in the middle of the night, right?
Copy that.
Copy that.
Right.
This is so crazy.
Tina?
Tina?
Hey, Mick, come on, let's go.
Is that you?
Mick, come on.
Let's go, babe.
Hey!
Mick, come on, let's go.
Please?
Stay in the truck.
I got this.
What are you doing, Mick?
Hey!
Who's there?
I suggest you show your face before I crack it open.
Mick, come on.
No, no, no.
Babe, come on, please?
This is your last warning, bro.
Mick, come on, now!
Hey.
Honking the horn, seriously?
Let's go.
You fucking crazy?
I'm not the one sitting there holding the shovel in his hands.
Let's get out of here.
Who was that guy?
God!
I don't know, but I wanna call harv, share our intel, huh?
Please, lock your door.
Oh, my god.
That was crazy!
I can't believe we did that.
Hot damn.
That was amazing.
That was nuts.
That was a whole lotta crazy.
You're a whole lotta crazy.
You're crazy.
Thank you.
Off.
Yes.
Off.
My hands are stuck, my hands are stuck.
It's okay, I'll take them outta there.
It's okay.
Oh, Jesus Christ, ray.
Oh, sorry, man, didn't mean to wake you up, just ran out of beer.
You scared the shit out of me.
Do you know what time it is?
Sorry, Mick.
Oh, it's all right.
I can't sleep, anyway.
Grab me one of those, will ya?
You know, you can't keep coming in unannounced like that.
Probably get your head bashed in one of these days.
Okay.
But why so edgy, hasn't ever much bothered you before.
We're in the midst of a thing.
Can't really say.
Oh!
Okay.
Listen, i know it's none of my business, but can I give you some advice?
Yeah.
Don't mess around with shit you don't understand.
Shit you don't know nothing about.
What are you talking about?
I seen all that zodiac killer shit on your table in there.
You're right, it ain't any of your damn business.
There's boundaries, ray.
I don't mind you taking a beer every now and then, but don't be going through my shit, dude.
I was there.
Where?
San Fran-fucking-cisco.
I was there in the '60s.
That man you're so interested in?
He brought that town to its knees.
He struck fear in the hearts of every single law-abiding citizen in that town.
We was all shitting our pants.
Mommy and daddy didn't wanna send junior to school.
The mailman was worried he was gonna get blown to pieces.
For crying out loud, the cops were walking their beats like they were frightened little schoolgirls just waiting to get picked off on their sidewalks.
'Cause nobody was safe.
Totally unpredictable.
Beautiful.
That man's an absolute genius, the way he evaded the law all this time.
Do you realize that?
There's never ever gonna be another man like him, not never.
You sound like a fan.
Bunch of theories about where he might've got to now.
Some think he might still be alive.
So, do yourself a favor.
Just take my advice, burn that film.
Forget what you seen, get on with your life, 'cause I promise you, nothing good's gonna come from this.
How do you know about the film?
Ah, there's no secret these cardboard walls can keep.
I gotta go.
I got some things i gotta take care of.
At this hour?
I gotta get up early.
Yeah.
Anyway, thanks for the beer.
I'm taking it to go.
All right, dude.
Yeah, baby?
I think it's just...
It's right up here.
Yup.
He's been staked out here all night.
Come on, come on, quick.
Before someone sees you.
Come on.
Quick, quick, quick.
Okay, okay, keep your pants on.
Okay, we are here.
What are we doing?
Now, what do we do?
Knock on her door, tell her her husband's the zodiac killer?
I've been scoping this place out for 18 hours, nobody's come or gone or even taken a piss.
I promise you, nobody's in that fucking house, and if they are, they're dead.
Now, by the way, i did some research.
Betty ferguson, 91 years old, her husband, balthazar, 94, both alive.
How the hell do you know that?
You owe me 15 bucks for your half.
Ninety-four years old, i mean...
You guys, he probably already has one foot in the grave.
Look, all we gotta do is find a piece of evidence that ties ferguson to the film, then we call the police.
Boom, done, ka-ching.
The FBI hasn't been able to catch him all these years, what makes you think we're going to find anything?
Is that the shitty attitude we're going to start with?
Maybe.
How is that a shitty attitude?
Because you're, like, "i don't wanna do this..."
Okay, ladies, ladies.
Ladies, you're both pretty, let's get to work.
Can you open the door?
I thought Tina told you that this lady was loaded?
Oh, shit.
You all right?
I'm fine, go.
Whoa!
We're not going in there.
Worry not, my sweet.
The good lord is watching over you.
We keep making a habit of this.
Well, we're here.
Opportunity has opened its door.
This looks like a haunted house.
That's good.
See, I told you, nobody's here.
Boo!
Wow!
What exactly are we looking for?
Anything.
Everything.
Just keep your eyes open.
Hey.
You think this is balthazar, or do you think they had a son?
I can't tell.
Look at this.
Golden gate bridge, San Francisco.
Where the murders took place.
So, this...
Yeah.
This has to be their son.
That has to be balthazar.
Guys, come down here.
Guys, down here.
Watch your step.
Look at this.
What?
What?
What?
Come here.
8mm camera.
Oh...
This could be the fucking camera.
And I found a picture of balthazar's son in front of the golden gate bridge in San Francisco.
Okay, look, there's gotta be a film reel here.
Just look.
Like, look for a canister.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
Yes.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, he's gone.
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Listen to me, you keep your shit together.
No, you keep your shit together.
You're crazy.
We have to find a reel, let's get a reel.
Two minutes, please?
Come on.
He left.
Let's go.
Hurry up, there's gotta be one here.
Shh.
Found it.
Harv?
No way.
Now, can we please go?
I'll only be one second.
Can we please go now?
Come on.
Come on.
It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, we're clear.
Come on.
Hey!
Christ.
Put it down, or I'll blow your head clean off your neck.
I can't do that, sir.
Okay, take it easy.
No one needs to get hurt, for god's sake.
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my house?
Are you balthazar ferguson?
I'm his son, Benjamin.
What are you doing here?
Uh... you know, um, we didn't mean to barge in, but your door was open.
We just...
We bought your mama's storage locker, and we found this, um, film reel.
And we thought, "you know what?
Maybe they might want it back."
I don't understand.
They've lived in Florida for the past few years.
Take a look at this place.
Does it look like they needed a storage locker?
Oh, so, you live here by yourself now?
You guys sure do ask a lot of questions while you're staring down the barrel of a gun.
We're gonna go.
So, thank you, sir.
So sorry.
Let's go, guys.
All right, we're going.
Take it easy.
Stop.
I think you forgot something.
What's that?
The film, just hand it over.
Well, if it isn't your mother's locker, then it's probably not her film.
Yeah, so sorry.
Really, really sorry.
Just, um...
Okay, take care.
Come on.
Ben, everything all right over there?
Yeah, fine.
These folks were just leaving.
Once again, our apologies, sir.
Yeah.
Here's my card.
If you find anything else you think might belong to me...
Try calling next time.
Will do.
Take care!
Didn't catch your name.
Y'all have a nice day.
Bye-bye.
Oh!
God, creepy.
How could you just hand it to him?
That film could have sealed the deal.
Are you serious?
What was i supposed to do, run?
Seriously, you guys, what if that was really the guy and I didn't give him the film?
What?
He would've just killed us right there?
Yeah.
That was the guy.
Yeah, it had to have been.
No, it wasn't.
Harvey?
Are you serious?
What are the chances he'd have a camera and a roll of 8mm film?
And there was the photo of him in San Francisco by the golden gate bridge.
And he worked for a newspaper, which they always thought.
He's the right age.
And it was his storage locker.
And he had a fucking gun in our face.
Why would he let the locker go?
He's old, maybe he just forgot.
Well...
You guys, we gotta go back.
We gotta lift prints, or do something like that.
Lift some prints?
That's my girl, yeah.
You guys been watching too many CSI:
Miami re-runs.
Trust me, he's not our guy.
He didn't have that killer look.
That killer look?
Yeah, no joke.
I saw it in Kuwait.
You know, some soldiers, they live for the action, others were scared shitless, and then there were the stone-cold fucking killers.
When you watch a man kill another man, and then he turns and looks at you, his eyes soft, relaxed, almost satisfied, you know you're in the presence of a real killer.
That other reel should be dry by now.
I'll meet you back at my place, yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Wait, what was that?
Looked like a cipher key.
A what?
What?
Remember I told you that he sent letters to the newspapers in code?
Yeah.
Just watch.
Right after he passes the gun, right before he wipes the blood off the knife.
That paper with the symbols on it.
What do you see?
I think this is a cipher key.
This could be the cipher key.
What are you talking about?
Code-breaking.
The zodiac, he always claimed that his name was in the cipher.
This could be the fucking key.
I'm sorry, harv,
I don't understand.
Can you just speak English?
Okay, these kinds of codes, they were used by, like, the CIA and foreign governments to encrypt messages going all the way back to world war ii.
Next to each symbol is a letter.
You replace each symbol with the correlating letter, and you have the translation.
I can see that you don't understand.
I'll show you.
I don't understand.
Okay.
What does that say?
It's symbols.
Right.
Now, this is a cipher key.
"E" has a corresponding square.
"O" has an upside-down triangle.
"Z" has a "v."
This reads "Zoe." "Zoe."
It's easy if you have the key.
Almost impossible if you don't.
Oh, man.
This could be the key to the 340.
What's the 340?
It's the unsolved cipher.
The 408 was broken.
How do you know all this shit?
Two tours, special ops, remember?
They taught you code-breaking in Kuwait?
Oh, yeah, it's like the abcs of electronic intelligence, but back in the day, code-breaking was like basic training.
Think you could crack it?
If this is a cipher key, fucking a.
Okay.
I gotta get into this.
Why don't you guys check on Ben's history?
Like, go to town hall and newspapers and see if he has a military record.
Because this shit here is military 101.
Done.
Yeah?
My coat, thanks.
Hey, Harvey, good one.
Hey, by the way, bring me your reel in the morning.
I wanna put it in my safe.
Babe, Harvey wouldn't screw us over.
He's a good guy, right?
I don't know.
Let me just drop you off at town hall and I'll go hide the film.
Wait, are you saying you don't trust him either?
Let's just say i wanna make sure we get our half.
Smart boy.
Yup.
Hey.
Um...
Call you when I'm done?
Careful.
Love ya.
Love ya!
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Oh...
Tri-countynewsledger.
Yes, no problem.
Thank you.
Hey, excuse me?
Hi.
Um...
These only go back to 1980.
Where would I find articles dating back to the late '60s?
Archives is in the basement.
Oh.
For employees only.
Um...
Polly, it's kind of important.
I'm sorry, we're about to close.
I bet you are, but it's just that I was...
Um...
I've been at city records, and couldn't find what I was looking for over there and it would be so helpful...
Miss, I can't help you.
Tri-countynewsledger.
Hey, Polly.
Yes, he is.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he is.
Okay, I'll let him know.
Thanks, Polly.
Thank you.
Thank you, Polly!
Okay.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Yup.
Hello.
God damn it.
Hello?
Hello?
"The zodiac has fled the west coast, leaving behind a trail
"of unsolved murders across the country.
"I have provided authorities with
"new evidence from an unnamed source
"that I believe will eventually
"lead to the identity of the elusive killer."
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, Mick.
Um, Mick, it's me.
Listen, I'm at the paper.
I need you to come get me because I think I found something good.
Um... okay, I'm here.
Come get me, now.
Okay, bye.
Shit.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Oh, god!
Shit!
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.
Um...
Okay, ferguson.
Um...
He was an only child.
He was born and raised here.
He was never married.
He never had kids.
Uh, he served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1964.
Zodiac's first kill was 1968.
Then after Vietnam, in 1965, he got a job with a paper in San Francisco as a crime reporter.
San Francisco?
Oh, this is good.
Yeah.
Okay, but there's just a little hitch in the giddy-up.
So, for some reason, ferguson decided to leave that job with that paper in San Francisco and move back here to start a job with the old ledger on, um, October the 1st, 1969.
The thing is, Paul Lee stine was killed in San Francisco on October 11th, 1969.
Shit.
Told you.
So, listen,
I know he's weird, but he can't be our guy because he was here, 2,500 miles away.
But listen to this,
I found an article that ferguson wrote about zodiac.
And ferguson was tracking this string of murders across the country, and he had come up with this theory that zodiac was actually making his way across the country to here.
So, maybe ferguson was actually onto the zodiac, and maybe the zodiac is still here now.
Or he was leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for the police to follow.
Oh, my god, what are you talking about?
Why aren't you listening to me?
Shit, I don't know.
Some people say he didn't even live in San Fran.
What people?
I read it on a fan site.
He has fans?
Apparently.
Lots of them.
Do you see a guy?
Feels like there's a guy just parked behind us.
I'm probably...
Let's get out of here.
Babe, let's just go.
What the hell?
No, no, no.
I'm gonna kick this guy's ass.
No, no.
Don't you...
No, no, no.
Honey, honey!
Hey!
Get in the car, let's just go.
I'm not...
Fine!
Go ahead!
Come on!
Did you get a good look at him?
No, i did not get a good look.
God, I don't wanna do this anymore.
Mick, it's getting too crazy, and I...
Zoe, we need this.
I don't...
I'm out.
We don't need this, Mick.
Do you know what half of $100,000 is?
You know what?
Don't act like I'm an idiot.
Mick, put that gun down!
Jesus Christ.
It's $50,000, Mick!
- That's it!
- That's a lot of money.
I think I'm worth more than $25,000.
That's not what I meant.
Look at you.
Thisisthezodiacspeaking.
Thisisthezodiacspeaking.
Thisisthezodiacspeaking.
Thisisthezodiacspeaking.
Son of a bitch.
- What is it?
- I think he's out there.
Thisisthezodiacspeaking.
God damn it.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Zoe?
Fuck!
Baby...
Fuck you.
Jesus.
No, fuck you!
Don't you fucking come...
Fuck you!
Everything okay?
Do you know who owns this car?
This car?
It's whoever she's sleeping with.
Her in that trailer, what's her name?
Uh...
Come on, you know it.
Spanish name...
Valencia, that's it.
Now, the thing about valencia is, there's a different car here, like, every night.
Although I hate to be judgmental, she's kind of a whore.
I don't know if that helps, does it?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
No.
Hey, baby.
You know I'm sorry.
You pointed a gun in my face, that's not okay.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
And, obviously, sorry isn't cutting it, I...
I know I messed up.
That's an understatement.
Messed up bad, but, baby, I swear,
I heard something.
Zoe, I need you.
I do, I can't do this without you.
Can we please just go see if Harvey's figured out the cipher key?
Hmm?
Maybe he has.
Maybe this is all over already.
And if it doesn't pan out,
I'll work our way out of this.
I promise, no more storage lockers, no more nothing.
I promise you.
I will give you one more day.
Ah, shit.
Come on in, close the door.
Shut the door!
Fast!
Jesus.
Just shut it.
Holy shit, Harvey.
I've almost figured it out.
This fucking dude was a genius, man.
He used a combination of a Caesar, vigenere and pigpen cipher.
Look, I'll explain it to you.
You see this symbol?
All these years, codebreakers have considered this its own character, right?
This one symbol is four letters, but this... this symbol here, this is one letter, shifted with a Caesar cipher.
Like a fucking brainiac, this guy.
Okay, so, i can make some critical assumptions, and I've narrowed it down to suspects that live within a 50-mile radius.
That's only hundreds.
No, no, no.
I think it's Ben ferguson.
No.
Yeah, yeah, he served in the military.
He was in San Fran between '67 and '69.
Mick, Mick, you're like everybody else.
You're trying to fit the evidence to the suspect.
That's not how you do it.
It's not Ben ferguson.
I don't know how many fucking times i have to say that.
Don't even try, he won't even listen.
Mick, his name doesn't even fit in the cipher.
I just need some more time.
I kind of just, like, fell asleep for an hour, but if I can get one more symbol,
I can eliminate 97% of these names, okay?
I can't do it with you guys here, though.
You need to...
All right.
I need to be alone, so...
Can ya pick me up a sandwich, or something?
I'm fucking starving.
All right, great.
Yeah.
Harvey seems like he's losing it.
Yeah.
I got it.
I got it!
I got it!
It's "e"!
It's fucking "e"!
Okay, okay, okay.
Eliminate those.
Boo-yah!
Do you see that?
Yup.
Don't brake, don't brake.
Mick, please drive.
Drive.
All right.
Holy shit.
You think Tina reported our little break-in?
It's fine, it'll blow over.
Just...
let's go get Harvey his food.
Where's Harvey's Van?
Doubt he'd leave.
By the smell of him, he hasn't left this place in two days.
Can you...
Yes.
Honey, we're home!
Harvey?
We brought you some barbecue.
Where you at?
Harvey?
Whoa!
He split.
What?
He split.
No.
No, no, no.
Not gonna let him get away with this.
He's gonna take the whole reward.
Oh, god.
I knew he'd do something like this.
God damn it.
Oh, Mick.
What a jerk.
Shit.
He's such a jerk.
No, no, no.
It's gonna be fine.
Something in these pages.
He said if he could find, uh, one more of these symbols...
Uh-huh.
...He could cut that list down to...
Like a handful, right?
Right?
Yeah, right, right.
Baby, look.
He did it.
He found it.
He figured it out.
Holy shit.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This...
Okay, I've got a page here with all the names and addresses crossed off.
I got one more.
Oh, good.
One... that's one, two, three.
Okay, hold on.
Here's one not crossed off.
Uh...
Gimme that.
I've got one, too.
Ah!
Here's one crossed off.
What do you got?
How many is that?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... nine.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, baby.
Yeah, all right.
We're not looking for the zodiac now.
Here.
Now...
Thank you.
We're going after Harvey.
You're sure you're up for this?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Okay.
Jesus.
Shit.
What is it?
I don't know.
Ugh, look for some shotgun shells for that thing, okay, hon?
Okay, I got it.
Go.
Hey, Mick, I found some!
Great.
Mick!
Mick, Harvey just took off!
Get down here!
Hang on.
Zoe.
Honey, he's getting away!
Shit.
Damn it!
Zoe!
Jesus!
Zoe!
Mick?
Zoe.
Okay, listen to me.
Harvey...
No,no,listentome.
I can see Harvey's Van right in front of me, okay?
I love you.
Just come get me.
Bye!
No, no, no, Harvey's dead!
Fuck!
Where are the goddamn keys?
Come on.
Hey,it'sZoe.
Leavea ...
Damn it.
Come on, Zoe.

Good.
Well,thenperhaps thereishopefor her yet .
Zoe,isit ?
Please, don't.
Iassumethatasyou havemadeit thisfar , youknowhowtofind me.
You must be very proud.
Fuck you.
After all these years, after all the police departments and the FBI profilers and programmers, all looking for me, they all come up empty.
But you, you found me.
Now, go figure.
Why?
Well, you have my films.
Now, I quit.
Cold Turkey.
For 40 years.
You have no idea the monumental effort that that took.
But I got away scot-free.
Except for Ben, of course.
He got close.
Him I had to follow.
I followed him all the way from San Francisco.
I was gonna kill him, but I grew to like it here.
Now, that fat-ass woman, she sold my locker.
I missed two payments.
My memory ain't what it used to be.
Too bad.
I wanna tell you something.
This is my story.
You're not gonna destroy my legend.
I left you a way out if you're brave enough to try.
You know, they herded a lot of young animals through here on their last journey.
And they designed this place to ease their anxiety as they herded them to the slaughter.
I don't think it's gonna have the same effect on you.
It's gonna hurt, but what can I say?
Enjoy.
Oh, your husband's on his way.
I'm gonna kill him first.
No!
No!
God.
Fuck!
Ow!
God damn it!
Come on, baby, come on.
Come on.
All right, there it is.
There it is.
Forty-five.
.38 caliber.
Holy shit, it fits.
Come on!
Where is she?
Oh, she's fine.
I need to see the reel.
You put down your goddamn gun!
I need to see the film!
Okay.
Fuck.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ow!
By golly, I nailed him.
No, you...
Zoe?
- Zoe?
- Mick?
Mick, baby, I'm over here!
Shit.
Mick, he's in here.
Where is he?
Mick, help!
Mick!
Mick!
Mick, Mick, Mick!
Jesus Christ.
We gotta get out of here somewhere.
I know.
We have to get out of here.
Go!
Go!
Go, baby!
Go!
Ahh!
Fuck.
Fuck you!
Get the fuck...
Fuck!
Don't move!
Don't fucking move!
Well, this is not gonna end well for you.
I will shoot that fucking smile off your fucking face, grandpa,
I swear to god, I will.
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
A lot of people have tried.
Shut up!
Put me out of my misery.
Go ahead, do it now!
By golly,
I wish this could go on forever.
Zoe!
Mick.
Mick.
Behind you!
God... come here.
Oh, my god.

What's wrong?
What is it?
No, baby.
It's just me just being my clumsy self.
Have I been sleeping?
You've been asleep for a long time.
Sorry.
It's okay, come here.
Come here.
Come sit with me.
It's going to be all right.
There you go.
Oh... yeah, look at us.
Hey, so, frank came by today.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He offered me my old job at the mill.
Even some extra hours doing security.
Did you take it?
Hell, yeah, I did.
That's good.
Mm.
It's time to make a real go of things, baby.
You mean the world to me.
What's wrong with that light?
It's just... it's a light.
It's always like that.
You know, it just needs a good kicking.
We gotta...
We should fix it.
I'll tell ya what,
I'm gonna go fix it right now, okay?
No, no, no, please stay here.
Just please stay here.
Baby, baby, it's okay.
It's okay.
I got this, all right?
I don't want you to go.
I'll be back in a second, okay?
Hey, I love you.
Just breathe.
Mick?
Mick?
Mick!
Mick?
Vampires.
Gets funnier every time I hear it.
Vampires nest in groups of 8 to 10.
Victims are taken to the nest where the pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
We don't decapitate vampires.
We irradiate them.
Cool.
The toys are the fun part.
For obvious reasons, we don't trust the Brits.
What the hell?
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?
I know all about the Colt.
You know, there's only five things in all creation it can't kill.
You think Mom would've wanted this for us?
Nothing comes before my family, not with me.
Really?
Or is that just what you want to believe?
You're an excellent liar, Mary.
Too bad Mom couldn't make it.
Yeah.
I feel like something's going on with her, and she ain't talkin' about it.
I have sort of been working with the British Men of Letters.
So where does that leave us?
Just... hear me out.
Please.
Wow.
Just wow.
Dean...
What the British Men of Letters are doing... what we're doing, it's a better way.
They...
Look, I'm not blind to who they are or what they've done, but -- When?
When?
When did you start working with them?
Since... before the lake house.
It wasn't Wally.
They brought me that case.
You were runnin' an errand for the Brits.
You kept it from us.
Cass almost died.
I -- A Hunter got killed.
Think I don't know?
I'm the one who burned his body.
I'm the one who told his wife.
I watch him die every night.
Good.

Before we get started, we've got a few new faces.
This is Pierce Moncrieff, a hunter out of Baton Rouge.
Pierce meet Alton Morehead, our head of RD -- weapons development, spell work, that sort of thing.
And Serena Colman, our Head of Security and Surveillance.
And, of course, you know Mary Winchester and her son.
Sam, please.
Plenty of seats.
I'm fine.
All right, then.
Let's begin.
As most of you know, Phase One of Project V is nearly complete.
Over the past months, we've focused our efforts on the NWR.
Midwest Region.
When we started our operation, there were 241 vampires active across 12 states.
We've killed all... but 11.
Wait, what?
Seriously?
How?
You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.
One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.
We treat them more like terrorists.
Uh, vampires may typically hunt alone or in small nests.
But scratch the surface, and they're all connected, from the lowest drone all the way up the chain to the top.
To the Alpha.
Mm-hmm.
When we find a nest, we don't just charge in a la John Wayne, guns a-blazing.
We wait, we watch.
We determine the size of the nest, its relationships to other vampire groups.
They tend to trade amongst themselves -- information, victims.
We're constantly expanding and refining our intelligence.
And when we've learned all we can, we go, we assemble a team -- And wipe them out.
Now all the remaining NWR vampires have bunkered up in an abandoned building near Wichita -- the Morest Hotel.
They think they're safe.
We've got the AVD locked and loaded.
AVD -- Anti-Vamp Device.
Tomorrow, we ship out, raid the compound, terminate the colony, and, uh, complete Phase One.
And then we move on to the rest of the country.
By the time we're done, there won't be a single bloodsucker left in America.

They're dead.

You got a line on vamps?
I do.
Interested?
Damn.
Sam Winchester.
Rufus told me all about you.
See, him and me worked a case together down the Atchafalaya.
I heard.
I tell ya, sure do miss that crotchety old son of a bitch.
Pierce?
Mary?
A question.
So?
Thoughts on our little operation?
And our team?
Serena and Alton seem smart.
Pierce...
You know he calls himself.
"The Hunter King of Baton Rouge"?
I do.
Unfortunately.
A buddy of mine knew him.
They worked together.
Once.
Right, you see, truth is, your mother excepted, we've struggled to attract the, top shelf of American Hunters.
Like you.
So what do we got?
10 bloodsuckers, give or take.
2 against 10.
I like those odds.
Yeah, the sun'll be down in an hour, so we should move fast.
Keep the rats from fleeing the ship.
Fancy.
You're right.
This is too easy.
Got another of those?
Ready?
Always.
Place seems empty.
Yes.
Curious.
Sam, this is why I asked you to come.
Even if you want no part of it, you needed to know.
So it wasn't a sales pitch?
Ha. 'Cause it was a good one.
I checked the areas upstairs.
This place is a ghost town.
You got anything?
Indeed.
I found her hiding in the basement with the corpses.
Let me go!
Where are your friends?
I don't know.
Where are they?
Tell... me... now.
Okay.
All right, that's enough.
Enough?
She's a monster.
I know.
Just...
let me.
You're gonna need to tell us where your friends are.
And you'll let me go?
I'll make it quick.
Hunting.
They went hunting.
Hunting whom?
The Hunters.
Where's McGillicuddy?
Aah!
What's happening?
It's the Morest vampires.
They're here.
No.
We gotta lock this place down, ASAP.
Fall back.
Lock this place down now!
Fallback.
Secureall exits.
Do not engage.
Fall back now.
Nice.
Wait!
Wait.
Doors locked?
For now.
The rest, they're spreading out, surrounding the building.
How'd they find us?
How'd they even know who we are?
He told us.
He's back to save us all.
Our father.
Your father?
The... the Alpha?
No, that's impossible.
Our Intel has him in... in Morocco.
He's been there for at least a decade.
Wrong.
I met him five years ago in Hoople, North Dakota.
You're dead.
You're all dead.
Your, extermination plan, did it have any contingencies for this?
No.
Comm's still out.
What about a scrying spell?
If we can get a message to England...
No, we can't wait for backup.
No, he's right.
This place was not built for defense, and those doors will not hold long.
Okay.
Who here has ever killed... anything?
Great.
All right, we gotta arm up.
Everybody, weapons on the table.
Blades, guns, spells.
Is this it?
Yeah.
That's not enough.
Most of our weapons are in the Armory, including the AVD.
We could set it off in the vents.
Maximize coverage, use the gas like the bug bomb.
Will that kill the Alpha?
Kill?
Doubt it.
Hurt?
Maybe.
You got anything stronger?
Where is it?
Where'd you get this?
I stole it.
From Ramiel.
Yeah, but it doesn't work.
We've no bullets.
Right.
You're right.
Right, um...
Okay.
We make some, then.
Got the recipe from my buddy.
- Bobby Singer?
- Yep.
All right, Mick, you're gonna need holy oil, sage, and myrrh.
Do you have that here?
Yeah.
Okay, make a tincture, coat a silver bullet.
Use this spell.
It'll mimic the original etchings.
- And that'll work?
- It better.
If not, start praying, 'cause we'll need a miracle.
Where's the Armory?
I'll take you.
I got your back.
Get to work.
Keep that door locked.
This way!
The Armory's out there.
Is there another way?
Is there another way?
!
Back there!
Go!
I got 'em.
Come on, come on, come on!
All right.
Let's get this spell going.
Got it.
Signum est im...
Imitandum.
Signum est imitandum.
It's me!
Open the damn door!
What happened?
It's bad out there.
Pretty bad in here, too?
No.
Pierce, you're a Hunter.
Yes.
My hunter.
Pierce and I have an arrangement.
He keeps me off the radar, and I pay him very, very well.
Alimony's a bitch.
I'm old.
I like living quietly.
You've been making my life awfully noisy lately.
You've killed so many of my children.
I've seen your work.
In England,
I didn't get involved because, well... it's England.
But America... yes.
America is my home.
And it's time that you... get... off... my lawn.
Mom?
Mom.
Mom, hey.
Are you all right?
Sam.
What happened?
Got it.
All clear here, big daddy.
We have to go.
Yeah, right.
All right.
I got you.
Here's what you're going to do.
We will bring your communications back online.
You will make a call to your superiors in London.
You'll admit defeat.
You will tell them to cancel this American incursion.
Then they'll watch as I devour you, live, onscreen.
Yes, it's a bit messy, but sometimes one does have to make a point.
Don't!
My, my.
The Colt.
Powerful weapon.
Sam, you are aware that there are five creatures on this Earth that gun cannot kill.
I'm one of them.
If that were true, I'd be dead already.
That gun can't save all of you.
Who said I was here to save all of us?
My family and I, we kill vamps when they get out of line.
And you've let us.
I have many children, Sam.
What's one, two, here or there?
Exactly.
So?
Let my mom and me go.
We'll walk away, go back to the way things were, to the way things are supposed to be.
Hunters and vampires, cops and robbers, a fair fight.
And the Brit?
You can have him.
Sam.
What are you doing?
Picking a side.
You bastard.
Mom!
Sam... you and I both know that gun isn't loaded.
You sure?
The gun can't save all of you.
Who said I was here to save all of us?
Bastard.
No.
Clever, clever boy.
Mick.
Mick.
All clear out there.
Took out a few stragglers.
The rest must've run when we dropped the Alpha.
Come on.
Where were you?
Following orders.
That's not...
People died.
Yes.
Well, I don't know how it is in your ivory tower, but down here in the muck, people die.
The old men want the Winchesters, so I made a play for Dean, and it was working until your operation went sideways.
Well.
Better luck next time.
So "went out, back later,".
Just getting a drink?
I was with him when we heard this place was under attack.
We drove like a bat out of hell.
How come?
I mean, you don't care for these guys.
You didn't even know I was here.
Right, of course.
When I thought something might've happened to you, nothing else mattered.
Dean, the things I said...
No, Mom, you were...
It's not your job to make my lunch and... kiss me good night.
It's...
We're adults.
You're gonna make your own choices, even if I don't like 'em.
Even if I really, really don't like 'em.
That's just something I'm gonna have to get used to.
Okay, Mom?
Yeah.
Where you takin' him?
We have ways of dealing with hunters who go rogue.
They aren't pleasant.
Good.
Good.
Sam.
If you hadn't been there tonight...
Yeah, we got the kill.
That's what matters.
Hardly an advertisement for the British Men of Letters, though.
Or my leadership.
Caught unawares with our proverbial pants down.
Believe it or not, Sam, we're not...
I'm in.
Look, tonight was bad, no doubt, but the Alpha Vampire is dead.
You're changing the world, and I wanna be a part of it.
And your brother?
Give me some time.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Vampires.
Gets funnier every time I hear it.
Vampires nest in groups of 8 to 10.
Victims are taken to the nest where the pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
We don't decapitate vampires.
We irradiate them.
Cool.
The toys are the fun part.
For obvious reasons, we don't trust the Brits.
What the hell?
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?
I know all about the Colt.
You know, there's only five things in all creation it can't kill.
You think mom would've wanted this for us?
Nothing comes before my family, not with me.
Really?
Or is that just what you want to believe?
You're an excellent liar, Mary.
Too bad mom couldn't make it.
Yeah.
I feel like something's going on with her, and she ain't talkin' about it.
I have sort of been working with the British men of letters.
So where does that leave us?
Just...
Hear me out.
Please.
Wow.
Just wow.
Dean...
What the British men of letters are doing...
What we're doing, it's a better way.
They...
Look, I'm not blind to who they are or what they've done, but... when?
When?
When did you start working with them?
Since...
Before the lake house.
It wasn't Wally.
They brought me that case.
You were runnin' an errand for the Brits.
You kept it from us.
Cass almost died.
I...
A hunter got killed.
Think I don't know?
I'm the one who burned his body.
I'm the one who told his wife.
I watch him die every night.
Good.
Nice work today.
I must say, this little beauty certainly worked as advertised.
We barely had to lift a finger.
Ah, the AVD.
I do love a new toy.
Mary?
Everything all right?
I'm fine.
- Ketch.
- Serena.
Oh, you're headed past the armory.
If you wouldn't mind.
Unpack, reshelve, and my SIG Sauer could use a good scrubbing.
I have three PhDs.
And we're all very proud of you, luv.
I'm doing this for you.
I'm playing three decades of catch up here.
And we're not?
How do you think this has been for us?
We're your sons, and you've been gone.
Our whole lives, you've been gone.
You said that you needed time.
No, you said you need space.
So we gave you your space.
But you didn't need just space.
No, you needed space from us.
That's not true.
Dean, I'm trying...
How 'bout for once, you just try to be a mom?
I am your mother, but I am not "just a mom."
And you are not a child.
I never was.
So between us and them...
It's not like that.
Yeah, Mary, it is.
And you made your choice.
So there's the door.
Sam...
You should go.
Another nest terminated.
No complications.
Bit...
Boring, really.
Good.
Well, boring's good.
And how's Mary?
Excellent.
As always.
She say anything about her boys?
As I've said many, many, so many times, we don't need them.
We already have the best Winchester.
Yes.
But that's not your call, is it?
Or mine.
The old men want them on board.
As far as London's concerned, where Sam and Dean Winchester go, the rest of the American hunters will follow.
Hmm.
Dead guy in Akron.
Body found two days ago.
Throat ripped out, ear-to-ear.
Well, good morning to you, too.
Read it.
The guy was a-a known drug dealer with enemies.
His throat wasn't ripped out.
It was slit with a knife.
I'm not really sure this is our kind of thing.
We don't know that.
His blood could've been drained.
It could've been?
You know what?
You find us a case.
'Cause I need to hit something.
Now.
You wanna talk about it?
Not really.
What was she thinkin', man?
I don't know.
Maybe we should ask her.
What?
Look...
I-I am pissed and... and frustrated and confused, too.
But we've frozen her out for days.
She lied to us, Sam.
I know.
For months.
I know, but it's mom!
I mean, whatever she was doing, she must've had a good reason.
A good reason?
A good reason for working with those ass clowns?
Look, I hear you, all right?
But... but at the end of the day, she's family.
We owe it to her to at least...
All right, you know what?
Screw it.
I need a drink.
You...
No, I need drinks.
Plural.
And this...
Whole peacemaker shtick that you've been running, first with Cass, now with mom, it's getting old, man.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're always playing the middle, Sam.
For once, why don't you pick a side?
Thanks for coming.
What's so urgent?
Sam...
I messed up.
I know I messed up.
But what the British men of letters are doing, this is bigger than us, Sam.
We've got a real shot here.
Shot at what?
A world without monsters.
A world where you and Dean don't have to hunt, where you can have normal lives.
I chose this life.
I know.
But you were going to school, to college.
And I get why you gave it up.
But what if you didn't have to?
What if there was a different future for you, for us?
That's why I'm doing this.
That is what I'm fighting for.
I am not trying to recruit you, but you need to know.
Things are changing.
Please.
Just let me show you.
It's, uh, just in here.
Wow.
Believe it or not, this is just their temporary base.
The Brits talk like they're roughing it.
Sam Winchester.
You didn't tell me your son was stopping by.
Didn't know I had to.
Anyway, welcome.
Yeah, um, you know, I really dig the whole low-budget mission impossible vibe, but I'm gonna head back.
You sure?
You're just in time for the briefing.
Mick.
I mean, that is, if you wanna hear how we're gonna exterminate every last vampire in America.
Sammy?
Lucy!
I...
"Went out.
Back later."
Whatever.
Oh, no.
Where's ketch?
I don't know.
He wasn't in his room and isn't answering his mobile.
Should we wait?
No.
What'd, you forget your key?
Hello, mate.
How'd you find us?
Well, this is a men of letters bunker.
The location's no secret to us.
Okay.
Cool.
Well, good talk.
And whilst I understand that you're not feeling...
Warmly disposed to me, I wonder, what's your disposition to this incredibly rare, unspeakably expensive, bottle of barrel proof scotch?
Before we get started, we've got a few new faces.
This is Pierce Moncrieff, a hunter out of Baton Rouge.
Pierce meet Alton Morehead, our head of RD...
Weapons development, spell work, that sort of thing.
And Serena Colman, our head of security and surveillance.
And, of course, you know Mary Winchester and her son.
Sam, please.
Plenty of seats.
I'm fine.
All right, then.
Let's begin.
As most of you know, phase one of project V is nearly complete.
Over the past months, we've focused our efforts on the NWR.
Midwest region.
When we started our operation, there were 241 vampires active across 12 states.
We've killed all...
But 11.
Wait, what?
Seriously?
How?
You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.
One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.
We treat them more like terrorists.
Uh, vampires may typically hunt alone or in small nests.
But scratch the surface, and they're all connected, from the lowest drone all the way up the chain to the top.
To the Alpha.
Mm-hmm.
When we find a nest, we don't just charge in a la John Wayne, guns a-blazing.
We wait, we watch.
We determine the size of the nest, its relationships to other vampire groups.
They tend to trade amongst themselves...
Information, victims.
We're constantly expanding and refining our intelligence.
And when we've learned all we can, we go, we assemble a team...
And wipe them out.
Now all the remaining NWR vampires have bunkered up in an abandoned building near Wichita...
The Morest hotel.
They think they're safe.
We've got the AVD locked and loaded.
AVD...
Anti-vamp device.
Tomorrow, we ship out, raid the compound, terminate the colony, and, uh, complete phase one.
And then we move on to the rest of the country.
By the time we're done, there won't be a single bloodsucker left in America.
They're dead.
They're all dead.
My whole nest.
I know, dear.
They got them.
Drink.
Get your strength back.
It's human and fresh.
You're safe, you and all the others.
See, I didn't choose this place for its ambiance.
Obviously.
This?
It's a fortress.
No one gets in here without me knowing about it.
No one.
Is that so?
Hello, my children.
Mmm.
Nice place.
Quaint.
Cozy.
Not much for small talk, are we?
Nope.
Well, surely, you have some questions.
Why I'm here, for instance.
You're here to recruit us.
You already got Mary playing your game.
You want me.
And Sam.
Well, I don't, but the old lads have taken quite a shine to you.
Mm.
Well, maybe they shouldn't have sent some chick to try to kill us.
Yes...
Toni.
No one predicted she would go rogue.
No one but me.
I had a sneak peak at what a neurotic, overreaching, time bomb she was.
We used to date.
Huh.
Yeah, I can see that.
Dean, I don't give a toss if you sign up.
Honestly, I don't care if you live or die.
But since we're such jolly good pals now...
Jolly good, huh?
Let me just say that the men of letters is an excellent fit for someone with our...
Inclinations.
"Our"?
As in you and me?
You're a killer, Dean Winchester, and so am I.
And if we go too long without something to track or trap or punch or gut, well, things get a bit ugly.
Don't they?
The men of letters keep me busy.
They point me in a direction and bang.
Off to the races.
It's not a bad life.
Speaking of...
Mmm.
Oh.
Now that you've heard what I have to say, places to be, vampires to behead.
You got a line on vamps?
I do.
Interested?
Damn.
Sam Winchester.

Yeah, right.
All right.
I got you.
Here's what you're going to do.
We will bring your communications back online.
You will make a call to your superiors in London.
You'll admit defeat.
You will tell them to cancel this American incursion.

Look, tonight was bad, no doubt, but the Alpha vampire is dead.
You're changing the world, and I wanna be a part of it.
And your brother?
Give me some time.
Vampires.

Over the past months, we've focused our efforts on the NWR.
Midwest Region.
When we started our operation, there were 241 vampires active across 12 states.
We've killed all... but 11.
Wait, what?
Seriously?
How?
You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.
One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.
We treat them more like terrorists.

Uh, vampires may typically hunt alone or in small nests.
But scratch the surface, and they're all connected, from the lowest drone all the way up the chain to the top.
To the Alpha.
[ Growls ]
Mm-hmm.
When we find a nest, we don't just charge in a la John Wayne, guns a-blazing.
[ Clears throat ] We wait, we watch.
We determine the size of the nest, its relationships to other vampire groups.
They tend to trade amongst themselves -- information, victims.
We're constantly expanding and refining our intelligence.
And when we've learned all we can, we go, we assemble a team -- And wipe them out.
Now all the remaining NWR vampires have bunkered up in an abandoned building near Wichita -- the Morest Hotel.

[male narrator] Auxilisun meets the high demands of your busy day with affordable, renewable energy.
But it wasn't always the power choice for 99% of the world's governing economic bodies.
Auxilisun was born from innovation required after the three-plant meltdown turned the world away from nuclear energy.
Oil barons and green extremists drove energy costs higher and higher, resulting in the energy crisis of 2018.
The world descended into chaos until Auxilisun introduced the tri-fission engine.
An Auxilisun containment facility was constructed over the three-plant disaster site so the tri-fission engine could clean up the dangerous radiation.
Progress was slow.
But independent scientific studies prove that Auxilisun's miraculous tri-fission engine not only worked, but it also created new energy from the radiation it was cleaning, and thus began the energy revolution of 2025.
No more dirty biofuels, inconsistent wind or expensive solar.
Tri-fission engines clean up old waste while Auxilisun continues to build its next-generation plants across the world.
Today nuclear energy powers everything you do, and Auxilisun is there to make sure it stays safe, sustainable and, most importantly, affordable.
Auxilisun-- creating a new future by cleaning up the past.

It's not much, but you know--
Maid comes at 10:00 a.m. for a fluff and fold.
Merry Christmas.
[sighs]
[whirring, clanging]
Robinson?
[bat squeaking, wings flapping]
Robinson?
[guitar strumming]
Robinson.
[strumming]
Oh.
Hello.
Wow.
I didn't realize this was gonna be a formal occasion.
I would've shaved my face.
What's that?
In case I need to reach you in the facility.
Aw, you don't need that.
You're never too far away.
So this is what you came here to see, huh?
[beeping, whirring] [beeping]
[beeping, whirring] [beeping] [beeping, whirring]
-What's wrong with it?
-[beeping]
Ah, I very much enjoyed our conversation.
I was feeling a little lonely before you turned up.
You are just a breath of fresh air.
I'm not here to talk.
I'm here to fix your facility.
Yes.
What's that?
Universal comm unit.
The nerve center for our whole communication array.
How do you not know this?
The thing's a dinosaur.
Like everything else around here.
Gibson Desert North is not a dinosaur.
It's the prototype that our entire company is hinged on.
And our proudest achievement.
Oh.
Well, then that's just a little bit sad.
[whirring]
[strumming continues]
So?
[low humming]
Sorry.
Can you fix it?
There's no power.
I have batteries.
I'm gonna have to run a diagnostics scan on the entire facility to see where the breakdown in the system is.
Diagnostics scan, huh?
Yeah.
Yeesh.
Would you mind showing me to the machine room?
Sure.
[strumming stops]
Now.
Don't touch the guitar, please.
[sighs]
What facility do you work at?
I don't work at any one particular facility.
I'm based at HQ.
Oh.
So you don't know anything about SDP then.
Sensory deprivation psychosis.
I came up with that.
What is it?
Well, you know, you spend too much on your own in a place like this-- no windows-- you go a little--
You go a little psycho, you know.
I mean--
That's why we give psychological profiles to all of our employees before they get the job.
Yeah.
Well, it's not that simple.
When did you say Dr. Zek is gonna be back?
I didn't.
Well, you have to know something about his schedule.
No.
I mean, you know, he works in a completely different part of the compound behind a locked door.
He's the one with the Ph.D., remember.
I stay out of his way, take out the trash.
And he just goes out every now and again?
Look, I'm not the boss.
He is.
I'm not his mum.
That's not what I'm suggesting.
I'm just--
We're almost here.
It's through here to his lab?
Yeah, yeah.
It's down the end of this corridor.
Get a chance to, uh, see Dr. Zek's crazy scientific experiments up close.
I've read his reports.
There's nothing in Dr. Zek's work that is outside of company parameters.
Oh, yeah?
Why does he do it all behind a locked door?
Never lets me in.
You're obviously creating some kind of fantasy.
Is this the isolation psychosis you're talking about?
No.
Well, maybe.
Take a look at his lab.
It'll bore you to death.
[lock opens] Just don't touch anything.
Oh.
Wow!
That... is something.
[whirring]
Is this where they keep all the shit?
The shit?
Nuclear shit.
No.
The waste is kept in Deep Burial, behind those doors.
You think this place is impressive?
Deep Burial is ten times the size.
What's this then?
The cooling system.
Maglev fan built to last 200,000 years.
But that's nothing compared to this.
This is the real secret to Auxilisun's success.
The tri-fission engine.
It takes the energy from the radioactive decay in Deep Burial and powers the fans.
I should have access.
This fan breaks down, guess who has to fix it.
That's impossible.
If both fans stopped, then this place would fill up with gas so fast, it would be like a stick of nuclear dynamite.
And never in the history of Auxilisun has even one fan broken down.
It's a brilliant design.
How come the only access through it is through this doggy door?
Robotics are the only thing that can fix a tri-fission engine.
Even in a hazmat suit, there's so much radiation, you'd be dead in 48 hours.
You should know that.
Where's the other fan?
Down in Deep Burial.
We're in the part of the facility that needs "golden ticket" access to enter.
Just looking.
Okay.
You need level-14 access to get down into Deep Burial sites.
Oh.
What are you, level 18 or something?
When they zap us with the scanners, we just get the basic package.
You know.
Office, bedroom.
Shitters.
Did you fix the comms?
No.
All the fuses and the cabling are all intact, so the problem must be somewhere between here and there.
Hmm.
You're gonna show me Deep Burial?
No.
No one goes down into Deep Burial.
Dr. Zek.
He goes into Deep Burial.
You're mistaken.
I hear him down there all the time.
Every time he opens that door, it rumbles the whole facility.
You're wrong.
[chuckles] You think I'm making this up?
No.
I think you're confused.
Dr. Zek doesn't even have fingertip access to Deep Burial.
You sure about that?
[coughing]
[coughing continues] [body thuds]
Robinson?
[clanging]
Jesus!
Robinson!
Robinson!
What?
Wha--
What?
Are you okay?
You're hitting me.
I'm sorry.
I just fell.
What happened?
[groans] Just a long day, you know?
I need some sleep maybe.
Do you generally pass out when you're tired?
Well, I didn't really pass out.
I just had a moment of-- What are you doing?
I'm fine.
When was the last time you requested a medical exam?
I don't need a medical exam.
[footsteps departing]
Abby Dixon.
Entry 002.
I arrived this morning to find Dr. Darius Zek, the chief scientific executive, absent, surveying the surrounding area.
But that is unconfirmed.
The facility's caretaker, Robinson Scott, was uncooperative.
The comms are still down, but my preliminary tests as to why were inconclusive.
I've never seen an Auxilisun facility like this.
It's... neglected.
And Robinson Scott--
I don't know who hired him, but... [sighs]
[gasps] [breathes heavily]
[screams] Sor--
Sorry.
[singing]
-Oi.
-Hmm.
Dodgy lock in there.
Sorry about that.
Can you fix it?
Well, there's no point, is there, really.
Not gonna make the same mistake twice.
I'm just not used to having guests.
You carry that thing everywhere, huh?
I heard you talking on it last night.
The walls are quite thin.
Well, I gather information, report back to Auxilisun.
It's my job.
It's protocol.
Is Dr. Zek back?
No.
Is it normal for him to be gone overnight like that?
Sure.
Macchiato.
Oh.
No, not for me.
That is the world's greatest macchiato.
You got to try it.
It's hot.
Sugar?
Uh, no.
I'm okay.
Leave her there.
Make me one.
I wanna do a medical diagnostic test on you.
Medical-- Last night--
No, that thing last night was fine.
Uh, no.
You can have serious health problems.
Here.
That's very sweet, but I am fine.
Now I'm fine.
When I was younger, I had a thing.
My kidneys.
Gone now.
I'm fine.
Was it from drinking?
It was cassies mainly.
Some drinking.
I have a sister, Margot.
She was-- She's... your age.
She sobered me up.
Took care of me.
Got me better.
Got me off it.
Everyone else left me behind.
She saw me right.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's gone.
Don't drink the water.
It's not good.
It's excellent.
You're crazy.
Do you not want yours?
It's all yours.
Two cups of coffee for me.
Watch out.
Cheers.
I was cleaning out this old guy's place, right?
This was something that we used to do when they got kicked out of their places.
And it was something that I could kind of do when I was a little high and stuff, you know.
Easy kind of job to do.
So cleaning out this guy's place, throwing away his clothes and furniture and things he's not gonna need.
And then I see at one point he's got a bunch of CD's.
So I'm thinking, "Oh, that's cool." Bunch of what?
He has a bunch of CD's.
Um, compound discs.
Uh, compact discs.
You know, the little music.
Little silver disc things.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like old turn-of-the-century music.
And he's got some stuff that I kind of recognize.
Like Oasis.
Remember?
Shed Seven.
Um-- [clears throat] East 17.
So I'm thinking while I'm cleaning this house out, I'm gonna play some music.
I'm looking through his music.
"I'm gonna pick that.
I'm gonna pick that." And this bag falls out.
So I'm thinking, "Oh, well, you know, he's kind of hiding that bag."
In this little zip bag.
So what's inside here?
I don't really know that much about turn-of-the-century music.
Do know a little bit about retro kind of drugs and stuff.
So I look inside and there's this-- this crystal, this rock, you know.
Like, "Hello!
Yes.
Know what that is.
Crack cocaine."
So run around the house.
Run around the house.
Like, make sure I'm kind of safe doing it.
Like, I need, like, a lighter and a little bit of aluminum foil and a little glass pipe type thing.
Get that all going.
You know, I'll do it.
Put it all in and break off a little bit of crack.
Put it in the pipe thing and then-- [imitating flame]
Kind of fire it up.
Wait.
Nothing.
Now, you're talking about maybe, like, two, three minutes or so.
You should be off.
You should be, like, away, doing it.
Nothing.
So I think, "Well, maybe it's like weak crack or something."
So break off a little more, put it in the thing.
Get the lighter-- [imitating flame] Kind of fire it up.
Nothing.
I end up smoking the whole piece of crack.
That's a lot of crack.
That is a lot of crack.
Nothing.
Like, 20, 25 minutes in, man, I get pounded by this, like, headache.
Just like my head gets filled with cement or something like that.
Kind of feel a little sick.
The next thing I know, I pass out on someone else's, like, floor.
It's not even my house.
I'm out, like this.
And the next thing I know, the owner of the house, this old geezer, the guy whose house we're clearing out, like, wakes me up.
So I get roused and, you know, I look around.
I'm trying to save face a little bit, but he sees--
He totally sees what I'm doing.
He can see all the stuff.
You know what he says?
"My grandma brought that back in 1991.
You just smoked a piece of the Berlin Wall."
[laughing] [babbling]
Oh, man.
Is that--
Like smoking history or something.
Went to hospital-- I was in hospital for two days, on my own.
And then, you know, ended up my sister came.
Kind of gave me a little bit of a talking to.
"Clean up your life.
You need to make some changes" kind of thing.
It's actually what brought me here.
She kind of-- She and I agreed to come out here, you know.
[beeping]
What about you?
Me?
Yeah, you know, family.
People you talk to, friends.
No.
No.
No family.
No family?
You an orphan, raised by Auxilisun?
No.
I mean, uh, I have a dad.
But-
- Technically.
I don't talk to him.
What is this?
I was just trying to make a friend.
Okay, so...
holidays roll around, you know, your birthday.
What do you-- Do you go for lunch on your own?
Play solitaire?
Just nap all day?
I have friends.
You do?
Yeah.
I'm skeptical.
Name them.
Name your friends.
Tesla and Jobs.
What type of names are those?
That's-
- Come on.
They're my dogs.
They-- They're your dogs' names?
[laughs] Come on.
What do you have?
Like little "wee wee wee wee"-- little yappy tiny little things that fits in a little-- like a little bag of sugar?
This is not adding up.
The becquerel levels are higher than they should be.
I think your calibrations are off.
Hmm.
Well, maybe someone's been in Deep Burial.
Hmm.
What?
No single person, no one, not even someone like Dr. Zek, could create a spike like this.
I mean, it's got to be your gear.
It's not calibrated.
I'll leave you to it.
You'll work it out.
Dr. Zek is still missing.
I'm worried about his safety.
And there's... a problem.
According to this data, the red zone is expanding, which I know is not possible.
It must be just a misreading with the gear.
Robinson is not as skilled as I would expect.
[sighs] I will recalibrate the meters myself.
[torch hissing]
[whirring]
[Abby gasps]
[Robinson] What are you looking at?
[gasps] Jesus!
Oh.
Sorry.
I was gonna go on the roof, hit some balls.
I thought I saw a man in the desert.
Okay.
May I?
Sure.
Hmm.
I don't see anything.
What if it's Zek?
What if-- What if he's out there and he's hurt and he needs our help?
I don't think Zek's coming back.
He's been gone four days.
No.
You said he left yesterday.
I didn't say that.
What are you not telling me?
He kind of lost it.
Sensory deprivation psychosis.
Big time.
I don't know if it was the isolation or the tests he was running.
Maybe he was exposed to radiation in Deep Burial.
But, you know, he's went a little--
And then the last night before--
You know, I'm gonna go hit some balls on the roof.
No.
No, listen.
The power lines were intentionally severed.
He cut them?
Tell me what happened.
You know, most of the time, just ignore him.
I stay in the control room.
He does what he wants.
Fine.
And then before he left, he just-
- Screaming.
Just screaming down that corridor.
It was getting louder and louder, at me.
"You did it.
You did it.
You broke-
- You damaged it.
You broke the fan.
You broke the fan."
He's pointing at me and accusing me and shouting.
He's a scary guy.
And I ran.
I ran and I hid.
And I heard the doors go, up top.
He took the buggy.
I don't-
- I mean--
I don't know how he'd survive out there.
I mean, I'm telling you, I saw something.
Yeah, well, you know, that-- that could be... this place.
It's the walls.
Ground.
The air... gets in you.
Hmm.
How have you been sleeping?
You've been dreaming?
Have you been dreaming?
Hmm.
Hmm.
You can spend as much time as you want in that sunroom.
But it gets inside your mind.
I'm gonna go play golf.
[sighs]
[clunking]
[beeping]
[pinging] [gasps]
Robinson?
[door opening]
[Klaxon blaring]
[breathing heavily]
[gasping]
[breathes heavily]
[grunts]
-[beeping]
-Robinson.
Robinson, it-it's Zek.
Can you hear-- Can you hear me?
Open the door!
[Robinson on comm] I'mnotsureIshould overridethesystem.
We're both gonna die if you don't open this door right now!
[breathing heavily]
[banging]
[door opening]
[Robinson] We don't know his state of radiation exposure.
We don't have time to discuss this.
Help me move him.
[golf club clattering]
Go inside.
I got him.
I think this is a mistake, Abby.
Go inside.
Go!
Go!
[grunting]
What the hell was that?
I'm just following contamination policy.
It's Dr. Zek.
You don't know it's Dr. Zek.
You don't.
Who else could it be?
We're in the red zone, 300 kilometers from the nearest town.
Well?
Yeah, it's Dr. Zek.
How is he?
His pulse is even.
Is it?
He was pretty exposed out there.
What's that?
Hexomorphone.
[air cartridge hisses] [gasps]
It should help combat the symptoms of radiation poisoning.
Hmm.
Didn't get very far, did he?
I don't know.
Maybe he came back.
[sighs] What happened to you?
[door opens, closes]
What is that?
Precaution.
He's dangerous, isn't he?
He's in a coma.
Well, you wake up from a coma.
Okay.
You need some help?
Why don't you just go back to the control room.
It's good, you know.
He's back.
That's the important thing.
[door opens, closes]
[sighs] [birds tweeting]
[clicking, hissing]
[clicking, hissing continue]
[cries out, gasps]
[sighs] [gasps] Wha--
You were screaming.
I was concerned.
It was just a nightmare.
About your dad?
You said his name.
It's this place.
I'm fine.
Could've fooled me.
My dad euthanized my grandmother when I was seven.
[Klaxon blaring]
[blaring continues]
[Robinson coughs]
Fan's not working.
Look, look!
N-No, that's impossible.
Just reset the console.
All of your readings have been off.
[Abby] I'm sure that's it.
[blaring stops] [machinery whirring]
Whew.
Okay.
That helped, but look.
It's still--
It's not movin'.
Okay.
[beeping]
I'm gonna check it out.
You just... stay here.
Okay.
[door opens]
[machinery rumbling]
[Robinson] What happened?
Did you go back in there?
Huh?
What?
[Abby] The fan.
I can't.
I don't have access.
Remember?
What are you accusing me of?
I'm sorry.
It-
- It's not possible unless somebody sabotaged the engine room.
It just-
- It can't-- It can't happen.
[sighs]
I need to get the comms back up.
Get back in touch with HQ.
This is beyond me now.
Okay, how serious is it?
Do we need to evacuate?
No.
As long as the other fan is up, it'll take days before the gases build up to a dangerous level.
Zek.
We are experiencing unprecedented shutdown of the machine and fan.
Requesting immediate emergency facility repair team.
Reason for the shutdown is unknown.
A fan is down.
How does that make sense?
With Auxilisun systems, a fan cannot go down unless... someone sabotaged it.
Signing off.
[strumming]
I don't like him being here.
He's handcuffed.
You don't know him like I do.
[plucking guitar string]
Look, why don't you let me watch him for a while.
No, I got it.
You've got a job to do.
It's under control.
You can't just stand here all night watching him.
I got this.
He wakes up... he moves... call me.
[plays guitar]
[sighing]
[heart monitor beeping] [clicking, hissing]
-Wha--
-It's-
- It's okay.
-What?
-It's okay.
What is this-- What is this place?
Where am I?
You're at Auxilisun Gibson Desert North.
Gibson Desert North?
Robinson.
He's awake.
Robinson.
Robinson?
Oh.
[chuckles] Okay.
Okay?
Thank God.
Wha-
- What?
Why am I--
I'm Abby Dixon.
I'm the facilities engineer from Auxilisun.
I was flown in.
What happened to me?
Just relax, and, uh, we'll get you up to speed.
-[Zek] Uh...
-Dr.
Sale told me to say hello.
Dr. Jeffrey Sale?
Three years in his class, and then I was his intern.
He got me my first job interview at Auxilisun.
[chuckles] He told me to tell you hi.
Oh.
We haven't talked since I came here.
Jeffrey and I got our master's together.
I was in his wedding party.
Yeah.
He's got some very nice things to say about you.
He made 'em up then.
[laughs] Well, he says that you are the most brilliant nuclear containment scientist that he's ever had the pleasure to meet.
[Abby] Here.
[panting]
Hello.
Thank you, Robinson.
You're welcome.
How do you feel?
[handcuffs rattle] What's this for?
Do you not remember what happened with the night that you left?
I can't recall.
-You went a little crazy.
-You had a nervous breakdown.
[Robinson] So that is, unfortunately, the reason why you're in handcuffs.
For our safety, but primarily for your safety.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm not feeling well.
I'm gonna lie down.
[Robinson] Yeah, right.
Relax.
Do you have a, um, personal hygiene kit?
I just think... it'd make Dr. Zek feel a lot better to not have a week's worth of desert filth all over him.
-You want me to go get it?
-I'll be fine.
Two minutes.
[door opens, closes]
Dr. Zek?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Come here.
I have to know that I can trust you.
Well, of course you can trust me.
Dr. Jeffrey Sale's son, tell me about him.
He's in his... 20s.
He just got married.
I haven't actually met him in person, but...
Tell me the truth about Jeffrey Sale's son, now.
He's not Dr. Sale's real son.
[sighs] His wife was pregnant when he met her, but I'm not supposed to tell anyone that.
Nobody knows that.
I know.
I know.
Except people worth trusting.
[sighing] Okay.
That man... isn't Robinson Scott.
What?
Dr. Zek, you acted like you knew him.
Well, I had to.
I'm handcuffed here.
The only reason he's not killing me is because you think that he's Robinson Scott.
Okay, look.
The other night, I was in my lab, alone.
I was working.
And then suddenly, there was a breach.
And Robinson-- the real Robinson Scott-- he went out to check it out, and he was obviously overpowered by this guy.
And then this man, he found me.
I left Robinson.
So if this isn't...
Robinson Scott, then how did this person get here?
We're in the middle of the red zone.
I have no idea.
He must have been dropped in.
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
Do you know anything about what he wants?
We need to get out of here.
We don't have much time.
So when's your next scheduled pickup?
I told them that I'd contact them.
Shit.
Are the comms still down?
Yes, but the antenna on your buggy.
I can hot-wire it, use the universal comm hub to get a signal.
Good.
Then you send out a Code 7 distress call, but you can't let him know that you sent it.
As long as he believes that you don't know the truth, we'll be okay.
We will.
And why wouldn't he just kill us?
And he hasn't tried to kill you yet?
He needs you for something.
I'm setting up my two-way tuned into my frequency.
So while I'm gone, if he comes back,
I'll hear everything that happens.
Good.
Thanks.
Abby.
Yeah.
We can do this.
[child giggling]
[beep] [Zek on comm] Abby, he's here.
He's coming.
Okay.
Here we go.
Where?
[chuckles] Where?
[beeping]
We have a problem.
Robinson is not Robinson.
Somebody broke into the facility.
That's why Dr. Zek attempted to escape.
We need help immediately.
So lie back.
Just lay your head back.
There.
Must feel nice.
Get that desert grime off you.
If you just put your hand down.
Gotta keep you handcuffed for your own safety, Dr. Zek.
I know.
These razors are incredibly sharp.
Try and think that you're in one of those old movies...
in a barbershop.
Where's Abby?
She went to my office, to my lab, to get my tablet.
Just gonna-- Yeah, that looks like it's gonna work just fine.
Ah, yeah.
Okay.
I'm actually gonna have to just lean you back a little further.
Just can't quite reach those--
Oh, no.
difficult areas.
You-You don't have to do my neck.
[Robinson over comm] Relax.
[Robinson] Just relax.
-Robinson?
-Just finishing up here.
[Robinson] Much better.
Done.
You do look much better.
Here.
You forgot my tablet.
Your lab was such a mess, I couldn't find it.
You'll have to give me better directions.
Oh.
Yeah, of course.
[Abby] Dr. Zek, you've had quite a day.
I know.
Think you could maybe use a little rest?
Hmm?
No, no, no.
I'll give you this to relax.
I don't-- [exhales]
-Put him down, Robinson.
-Okay.
Just keep an eye on him.
He was extremely nervous.
Well done for knocking him out like that.
I just thought we would both sleep a little easier knowing that he was drugged asleep.
Yeah.
He doesn't seem to remember anything.
You believe him?
Does he seem dangerous to you?
Well... things aren't always what they seem.
Hmm?
[door opens, closes]
[snores, groans]
Shh.
What's happening?
I had to inject you to wake you up.
Where's the guy?
He's sleeping.
We gotta get out of here.
Look away.
Did you send the signal?
Not yet.
That's where we're headed.
[Abby] We have to get out of here.
It's gonna take 40 minutes for them to get here.
-We'll wait outside.
Okay.
-Okay, let's go.
Too late.
[Abby gasps]
What are you doing, Abby?
[Abby] You're not Robinson Scott.
What are you talking about?
-Dr.
Zek--
-Stay still!
Dr. Zek told me-- [Zek] Abby.
Abby.
The doctor, eh?
You trust the good doctor?
Is that how it works?
You tell the truth.
You tell her the truth right now!
What's he talking about?
The ravings of a madman.
You tell her about Gibson Desert North.
About Auxilisun's crown jewel, now!
What?
Tell her.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
And you're willing to bet our lives on that, are you?
-Um, yeah.
-[Abby grunts]
[Abby shrieks] Ow!
Aaah!
[Robinson grunts] Aaah!
[Robinson groaning]
Let me see.
Am I bleeding?
Looks like the laser cauterized the wound.
Come here.
Aaah!
[grunts] To the bed.
Here.
What did he say about me?
[grunts]
Don't touch it.
He told me you were some kind of terrorist that broke in here and killed the real Robinson.
You believed him?
Dr. Zek is a respected member of the scientific community.
What was I supposed to think?
Dr. Zek is a lunatic.
How am I gonna get across the red zone?
How am I gonna get across the size of that desert?
I'd have radiation poisoning by the time I got here.
He destroyed the door mechanism.
[door warbles]
We're locked in here.
He's gonna escape without us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He's not escaping.
He's going to Deep Burial.
[Robinson grunts, gasps]
Bastard.
Just...
Hmm.
What did you mean?
When you said that-- that this whole place was a lie.
It hurts.
What did you mean?
This place is supposed to be a secure nuclear storage facility.
He's turned it into a bomb.
Thanks.
Abby, I don't--
I don't know what we do now.
How do we get to him?
He's in Deep Burial.
I have access.
You do?
Yeah.
That's great.
Hang on.
Okay.
I'm gonna rewire the door so the mechanism works from this side.
[grunts] [instrument clattering]
[Robinson] You can do that?
[beeps] [grunts]
[Robinson] Nice.
[Robinson grunts] Watch out.
We need to find him.
I can trace his location on my tablet.
No time for that!
[Robinson] No time!
[tablet beeping]
[gasping]
Fuck.
[beeping, whirring]
-[Robinson grunts] -[Zek shouting]
[grunting] [gun powers up]
Drop the club.
Okay, okay.
Who are you?
Okay, okay.
[Robinson, Abby groaning]
[coughs, retches]
You're the one with radiation sickness.
-You walked across the red zone?
-Shut up!
-Who are you?
Please.
-Shut up.
Who are you?
Shut up!
Nothing can stop me from doing what I came here to do!
Aaah!
[groans]
[Klaxon blaring]
[Abby] Aaah!
[gun powers up] What are you doing?
Gibson Desert North has been decaying at an unpredictable rate for years, and you knew it!
You know that Auxilisun system's fail-safe.
There's no way--
What about Barrow Creek?
All of the closest inhabitable cities are supposed to be well within the green zone.
So unless Barrow Creek-- the entire town-- got up and moved, the red zone is expanding.
Yes.
When were you gonna tell Auxilisun?
Auxilisun already knows.
What?
Dr. Sale and I know the truth.
The truth?
Yeah.
The truth that you're killing people?
The truth is that the energy we give the world is more important than some piece-of-shit small town--
But no, people di-- in the middle of nowhere!
His-
- That man's family.
How many have lived?
Do you know how many hospitals, cities, homes use our energy?
There were 230 assholes in Barrow Creek!
Shut up!
[gun powers up]
Aaah!
Shut up, okay?
[gun powers down]
You can find your own way out.
[Klaxon blaring in distance]
[Zek] Abby.
[child giggling on video]
[coughs] So you were the one that was ruining the fans.
You walked across the red zone by yourself?
How long have you been dying?
Not sure.
We all got sick at the same time.
I just lasted longer than Margot... and Sammy.
This won't bring them back.
I know what it's like to lose your family.
[rumbling]
Then you know why I have to do this.
No.
You're just gonna kill more people.
I can't let you--
Don't follow me, Abby.
Stop.
Stay back!
Stop!
No!
Stay back, Abby!
Stop.
Auxilisun, they took everything from me.
If you destroy this place, you're no better than they are.
And you are?
[gasping]
[Abby] No.
[Robinson] The world needs a tragedy
-to see what's been happening here.
-[gun powers up]
I'll kill you before I let that happen.
No, you won't.
[breathing heavily]
If we can get out of here,
I have all the information on my ADATA.
You and I, we can blow the whistle.
We can let everybody know.
No, Abby.
They'll shut you down, Abby!
This thing's bigger than you!
The whole world, Abby!
They're being lied to!
Is this what Margot and Sammy would have wanted?
Not sure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get a chance to ask 'em.
No!
[electricity crackling]
[Klaxon blaring] [rumbling]
This is CTE Abby Dixon to Auxilisun tri-copter.
Rhine, do you read me?

Auxilisun meets the high demands of your busy day with affordable, renewable energy.
But it wasn't always the power choice for 99% of the world's governing economic bodies.
Auxilisun was born from innovation required after the three-plant meltdown turned the world away from nuclear energy.
Oil barons and green extremists drove energy costs higher and higher, resulting in the energy crisis of 2018.
The world descended into chaos until Auxilisun introduced the tri-fission engine.
An Auxilisun containment facility was constructed over the three-plant disaster site, so the tri-fission engine could clean up the dangerous radiation.
Progress was slow.
But independent scientific studies prove that Auxilisun's miraculous tri-fission engine not only worked, but it also created new energy from the radiation it was cleaning, and thus began the energy revolution of 2025.
No more dirty biofuels, inconsistent wind or expensive solar.
Tri-fission engines clean up old waste while Auxilisun continues to build its next-generation plants across the world.
Today nuclear energy, powers everything you do, and Auxilisun is there to make sure it stays safe, sustainable, and, most importantly, affordable.
Auxilisun...
Creating a new future by cleaning up the past.
Lights on.
Alarm off.
CSE Dixon, it's the middle of the night.
David, communications are down with both of the field techs...
It's Christmas Day.
Is this something that can wait until tomorrow?
Gibson Desert North is the largest nuclear waste repository in the southern hemisphere.
It doesn't take the day off.
Something's wrong.
We don't have anyone available.
- I'll go.
- What?
You don't have anyone available.
I'm going out there myself.
Call the transpo.
I'll be ready in ten.
Coming in on the red zone now.
Completely uninhabitable.
You do not wanna lose your fuel out here.
So Auxilisun's sending a tech assistant to a facility this remote.
No chief engineers available?
I am a chief tech engineer.
- How many facilities you engineered?
- None.
I was recently promoted.
My work's been lab-based.
Live view up.
Now, that's what a real-life Auxilisun containment facility looks like.
You don't see that in a lab.
This your first flight schedule too?
There's nothing in here about a pickup.
We've lost communication to Gibson Desert North.
Once I get them back up, I'll contact Auxilisun HQ for a pickup and request that they don't send you.
System activated.
Decontaminate.
Begin decontamination.
Abby Dixon reporting.
I.D. HEB0511.
Entry 001.
Upon my entry into the facility, no employee response.
The facility itself is in a state of disrepair, possibly deserted.
I will log my entries and upload them as soon as I get the comms back online.
Hello!
Who are you?
I'm a technical facility engineer from Auxilisun.
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing here?
Your communications are down.
I'm here to get you back online.
Some ID?
Can I see some ID?
I can't connect to openwork.
Openwork's not worth shit down here.
- Do you have a scanner?
- There's a scanner.
There.
On the table.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
- Happy?
- Mm-hmm.
My name's Dixon.
Abby Dixon.
How'd you get here?
I was just dropped off by a company tri-copter.
Just you?
Yeah.
- Just you.
- Just me.
Mm-hmm.
I'll be here long enough to get you back online.
Which one are you?
Zek or Robinson.
Robinson.
I'm Robinson.
Yeah.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Making noises in the corridor.
They don't teach you how to knock at Auxilisun HQ?
Where's Dr. Zek?
He's out.
What do you mean "out"?
Where?
Does surveys.
In the desert.
I don't know.
It's not my job.
Well, when will he be back?
He didn't say.
Took the buggy.
What is that?
It's nothing.
I got it under control.
What do you mean it's nothing?
It's...
It's obviously something.
It's not.
What are you talking about?
Right here it says, "Error code 8627B."
What does that mean?
What's the procedure?
Mm-hmm.
The procedure is you need to chill out.
Okay, this is not a joke.
This is a sophisticated facility, and I'm here to assess the communication breakdown, and this could potentially be a communication...
I pulled that lever.
Did you see me pull that lever?
It resets the system.
Yeah.
It makes all these red lights go green.
I told you I had it under control.
Hmm?
Will you at least show me to my room?
Mm.
I wasn't...
Expecting guests.
I'm sure you'll love your accommodations.
All right.
General...
Common area.
Um, kitchen, obviously.
And up those stairs is the sunroom.
Doesn't look like it gets much use.
No.
Um, not really the tanning type.
Right.
But that's not the point.
- The sunrooms were designed...
- To provide a certain amount of UV, to keep your mind in the right...
My mental health is fine, thank you.
- Is this sick bay?
- Yeah.
Your own doctor as well.
It's kind of fun.
So... this...
Yeah, that's you.
Guest quarters.
It's not much, but you know...
Maid comes at 10:00 a.m. for a fluff and fold.
Merry Christmas.
Robinson?
Robinson?
Robinson.
Oh.
Hello.
Wow.
I didn't realize this was gonna be a formal occasion.
I would've shaved my face.
What's that?
In case I need to reach you in the facility.
Aw, you don't need that.
You're never too far away.
So this is what you came here to see, huh?
What's wrong with it?
Ah, I very much enjoyed our conversation.
I was feeling a little lonely before you turned up.
You are just a breath of fresh air.
I'm not here to talk.
I'm here to fix your facility.
Yes.
What's that?
Universal comm unit.
The nerve center for our whole communication array.
How do you not know this?
The thing's a dinosaur.
Like everything else around here.
Gibson Desert North is not a dinosaur.
It's the prototype that our entire company is hinged on.
And our proudest achievement.
Oh.
Well, then that's just a little bit sad.
So?
Sorry.
Can you fix it?
There's no power.
I have batteries.
I'm gonna have to run a diagnostics scan on the entire facility to see where the breakdown in the system is.
Diagnostics scan, huh?
Yeah.
Yeesh.
Would you mind showing me to the machine room?
Sure.
Now.
Don't touch the guitar, please.
What facility do you work at?
I don't work at any one particular facility.
I'm based at HQ.
Oh.
So you don't know anything about SDP then.
Sensory deprivation psychosis.
I came up with that.
What is it?
Well, you know, you spend too much on your own in a place like this.
No windows...
You go a little...
You go a little psycho, you know.
I mean...
That's why we give psychological profiles to all of our employees
- before they get the job.
- Yeah.
Well, it's not that simple.
When did you say Dr. Zek is gonna be back?
I didn't.
Well, you have to know something about his schedule.
No.
I mean, you know, he works in a completely different part of the compound, behind a locked door.
He's the one with the Ph.D., remember.
I stay out of his way, take out the trash.
And he just goes out every now and again?
Look, I'm not the boss.
He is.
I'm not his mum.
That's not what I'm suggesting.
I'm just...
We're almost here.
It's through here to his lab?
Yeah, yeah.
It's down the end of this corridor.
Get a chance to, uh, see Dr. Zek's crazy scientific experiments up close.
I've read his reports.
There's nothing in Dr. Zek's work that is outside of company parameters.
Oh, yeah?
Why does he do it all behind a locked door?
Never lets me in.
You're obviously creating some kind of fantasy.
Is this the isolation psychosis you're talking about?
No.
Well, maybe.
Take a look at his lab.
It'll bore you to death.
Just don't touch anything.
Oh.
Wow!
That... is something.
Is this where they keep all the shit?
The shit?
Nuclear shit.
No.
The waste is kept in Deep Burial, behind those doors.
You think this place is impressive?
Deep Burial is ten times the size.
What's this then?
The cooling system.
Maglev fan built to last 200,000 years.
But that's nothing compared to this.
This is the real secret to Auxilisun's success.
The tri-fission engine.
It takes the energy from the radioactive decay in Deep Burial and powers the fans.
I should have access.
This fan breaks down, guess who has to fix it.
That's impossible.
If both fans stopped, then this place would fill up with gas so fast, it would be like a stick of nuclear dynamite.
And never in the history of Auxilisun has even one fan broken down.
It's a brilliant design.
How come the only access through it is through this doggy door?
Robotics are the only thing that can fix a tri-fission engine.
Even in a hazmat suit, there's so much radiation, you'd be dead in 48 hours.
You should know that.
Where's the other fan?
Down in Deep Burial.
We're in the part of the facility that needs "golden ticket" access to enter.
- Just looking.
- Okay.
You need level-14 access to get down into Deep Burial sites.
Oh.
What are you, level 18 or something?
When they zap us with the scanners, we just get the basic package.
You know.
Office, bedroom.
- Shitters.
- Did you fix the comms?
No.
All the fuses and the cabling are all intact, so the problem must be somewhere between here and there.
Hmm.
You're gonna show me Deep Burial?
No.
No one goes down into Deep Burial.
Dr. Zek.
He goes into Deep Burial.
You're mistaken.
I hear him down there all the time.
Every time he opens that door, it rumbles the whole facility.
You're wrong.
You think I'm making this up?
No.
I think you're confused.
Dr. Zek doesn't even have fingertip access to Deep Burial.
You sure about that?
Robinson?
Jesus!
Robinson!
Robinson!
What?
Wha...
- What?
- Are you okay?
- You're hitting me.
- I'm sorry.
- I just fell.
- What happened?
Just a long day, you know?
I need some sleep maybe.
Do you generally pass out when you're tired?
Well, I didn't really pass out.
I just had a moment of...
What are you doing?
I'm fine.
When was the last time you requested a medical exam?
I don't need a medical exam.
Abby Dixon.
Entry 002.
I arrived this morning to find Dr. Darius Zek, the chief scientific executive, absent, surveying the surrounding area.
But that is unconfirmed.
The facility's caretaker, Robinson Scott, was uncooperative.
The comms are still down, but my preliminary tests as to why were inconclusive.
I've never seen an Auxilisun facility like this.
It's... neglected.
And Robinson Scott...
I don't know who hired him, but...
Sor...
Sorry.
- Oi.
- Hmm.
Dodgy lock in there.
Sorry about that.
Can you fix it?
Well, there's no point, is there, really.
Not gonna make the same mistake twice.
I'm just not used to having guests.
You carry that thing everywhere, huh?
I heard you talking on it last night.
The walls are quite thin.
Well, I gather information, report back to Auxilisun.
It's my job.
It's protocol.
Is Dr. Zek back?
No.
Is it normal for him to be gone overnight like that?
Sure.
Macchiato.
Oh.
No, not for me.
That is the world's greatest macchiato.
You got to try it.
It's hot.
- Sugar?
- Uh, no.
I'm okay.
Leave her there.
Make me one.
I wanna do a medical diagnostic test on you.
Medical...
Last night...
- No, that thing last night was fine.
- Uh, no.
You can have serious health problems.
Here.
That's very sweet, but I am fine.
Now I'm fine.
When I was younger, I had a thing.
My kidneys.
Gone now.
I'm fine.
Was it from drinking?
It was cassies mainly.
Some drinking.
I have a sister, Margot.
She was...
She's... your age.
She sobered me up.
Took care of me.
Got me better.
Got me off it.
Everyone else left me behind.
She saw me right.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's gone.
Don't drink the water.
It's not good.
It's excellent.
You're crazy.
Do you not want yours?
It's all yours.
Two cups of coffee for me.
Watch out.
Cheers.
I was cleaning out this old guy's place, right?
This was something that we used to do when they got kicked out of their places.
And it was something that I could kind of do, when I was a little high and stuff, you know.
Easy kind of job to do.
So cleaning out this guy's place, throwing away his clothes and furniture and things he's not gonna need.
And then I see at one point he's got a bunch of CD's.
- So I'm thinking, "Oh, that's cool."
- Bunch of what?
He has a bunch of CD's.
Um, compound discs.
Uh, compact discs.
You know, the little music.
- Little silver disc things.
- Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like old turn-of-the-century music.
And he's got some stuff that I kind of recognize.
Like Oasis.
Remember?
Shed Seven.
Um...
East 17.
So I'm thinking while I'm cleaning this house out, I'm gonna play some music.
I'm looking through his music.
"I'm gonna pick that.
I'm gonna pick that." And this bag falls out.
So I'm thinking, "Oh, well, you know, he's kind of hiding that bag."
In this little zip bag.
So what's inside here?
I don't really know that much about turn-of-the-century music.
Do know a little bit about retro kind of drugs and stuff.
So I look inside and there's this... this crystal, this rock, you know.
Like, "Hello!
Yes.
Know what that is.
Crack cocaine."
So run around the house.
Run around the house.
Like, make sure I'm kind of safe doing it.
Like, I need, like, a lighter and a little bit of aluminum foil and a little glass pipe type thing.
Get that all going.
You know, I'll do it.
Put it all in and break off a little bit of crack.
Put it in the pipe thing and then...
Kind of fire it up.
Wait.
Nothing.
Now, you're talking about maybe, like, two, three minutes or so.
You should be off.
You should be, like, away, doing it.
Nothing.
So I think, "Well, maybe it's like weak crack or something."
So break off a little more, put it in the thing.
Get the lighter...
Kind of fire it up.
Nothing.
I end up smoking the whole piece of crack.
That's a lot of crack.
That is a lot of crack.
Nothing.
Like, 20, 25 minutes in, man, I get pounded by this, like, headache.
Just like my head gets filled with cement or something like that.
Kind of feel a little sick.
The next thing I know, I pass out on someone else's, like, floor.
It's not even my house.
I'm out, like this.
And the next thing I know, the owner of the house, this old geezer, the guy whose house we're clearing out, like, wakes me up.
So I get roused and, you know, I look around.
I'm trying to save face a little bit, but he sees...
He totally sees what I'm doing.
He can see all the stuff.
You know what he says?
"My grandma brought that back in 1991, you just smoked a piece of the Berlin Wall."
Oh, man.
Is that...
Like smoking history or something.
Went to hospital...
I was in hospital for two days, on my own.
And then, you know, ended up my sister came.
Kind of gave me a little bit of a talking to.
"Clean up your life.
You need to make some changes" kind of thing.
It's actually what brought me here.
She kind of...
She and I agreed to come out here, you know.
What about you?
Me?
Yeah, you know, family.
People you talk to, friends.
No.
No.
No family.
No family?
You an orphan, raised by Auxilisun?
No.
I mean, uh, I have a dad.
But... technically, I don't talk to him.
What is this?
I was just trying to make a friend.
Okay, so... holidays roll around, you know, your birthday.
What do you...
Do you go for lunch on your own?
Play solitaire?
Just nap all day?
I have friends.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I'm skeptical.
- Name them.
Name your friends.
- Tesla and Jobs.
- What type of names are those?
- That's...
Come on.
- They're my dogs.
They...
- They're your dogs' names?
Come on.
What do you have?
Like little "wee wee wee wee"...
little yappy tiny little things that fits in a little...
like a little bag of sugar?
This is not adding up.
The becquerel levels are higher than they should be.
I think your calibrations are off.
Hmm.
Well, maybe someone's been in Deep Burial.
Hmm.
- What?
- No single person, no one, not even someone like Dr. Zek, could create a spike like this.
I mean, it's got to be your gear.
It's not calibrated.
I'll leave you to it.
You'll work it out.
Dr. Zek is still missing.
I'm worried about his safety.
And there's... a problem.
According to this data, the red zone is expanding, which I know is not possible.
It must be just a misreading with the gear.
Robinson is not as skilled as I would expect.
I will recalibrate the meters myself.
- What are you looking at?
- Jesus!
Oh.
Sorry.
I was gonna go on the roof, hit some balls.
I thought I saw a man in the desert.
Okay.
May I?
Sure.
Hmm.
I don't see anything.
What if it's Zek?
What if...
What if he's out there and he's hurt and he needs our help?
I don't think Zek's coming back.
He's been gone four days.
No.
You said he left yesterday.
I didn't say that.
What are you not telling me?
He kind of lost it.
Sensory deprivation psychosis.
Big time.
I don't know if it was the isolation or the tests he was running.
Maybe he was exposed to radiation in Deep Burial.
But, you know, he's went a little...
And then the last night before...
You know, I'm gonna go hit some balls on the roof.
No.
No, listen.
The power lines were intentionally severed.
He cut them?
Tell me what happened.
You know, most of the time, just ignore him.
I stay in the control room.
He does what he wants.
Fine.
And then before he left, he just...
Screaming.
Just screaming down that corridor.
It was getting louder and louder, at me.
"You did it.
You did it.
You broke...
You damaged it.
You broke the fan.
You broke the fan."
He's pointing at me and accusing me and shouting.
He's a scary guy.
And I ran.
I ran and I hid.
And I heard the doors go, up top.
He took the buggy.
I don't...
I mean...
I don't know how he'd survive out there.
I mean, I'm telling you, I saw something.
Yeah, well, you know, that... that could be... this place.
It's the walls.
Ground.
The air...
Gets in you.
Hmm.
How have you been sleeping?
You've been dreaming?
Have you been dreaming?
Hmm.
Hmm.
You can spend as much time as you want in that sunroom.
But it gets inside your mind.
I'm gonna go play golf.
Robinson?
Robinson.
Robinson, it... it's Zek.
Can you hear...
Can you hear me?
Open the door!
I'm not sure I should override the system.
We're both gonna die if you don't open this door right now!
We don't know his state of radiation exposure.
We don't have time to discuss this.
Help me move him.
Go inside.
I got him.
I think this is a mistake, Abby.
Go inside.
Go!
Go!
What the hell was that?
I'm just following contamination policy.
It's Dr. Zek.
You don't know it's Dr. Zek.
You don't.
Who else could it be?
We're in the red zone, 300 kilometers from the nearest town.
Well?
Yeah, it's Dr. Zek.
- How is he?
- His pulse is even.
Is it?
He was pretty exposed out there.
What's that?
Hexomorphone.
It should help combat the symptoms of radiation poisoning.
Hmm.
Didn't get very far, did he?
I don't know.
Maybe he came back.
What happened to you?
What is that?
- Precaution.
- He's dangerous, isn't he?
He's in a coma.
Well, you wake up from a coma.
- Okay.
- You need some help?
Why don't you just go back to the control room.
It's good, you know.
He's back.
That's the important thing.
Wha...
You were screaming.
I was concerned.
It was just a nightmare.
About your dad?
You said his name.
It's this place.
I'm fine.
Could've fooled me.
My dad euthanized my grandmother when I was seven.
Fan's not working.
Look, look!
N-No, that's impossible.
Just reset the console.
All of your readings have been off.
I'm sure that's it.
Whew.
Okay.
That helped, but look.
It's still...
It's not movin'.
Okay.
I'm gonna check it out.
You just... stay here.
Okay.
What happened?
Did you go back in there?
Huh?
What?
The fan.
I can't.
I don't have access.
Remember?
What are you accusing me of?
I'm sorry.
It...
It's not possible, unless somebody sabotaged the engine room.
It just... it can't... it can't happen.
I need to get the comms back up.
Get back in touch with HQ.
This is beyond me now.
Okay, how serious is it?
Do we need to evacuate?
No.
As long as the other fan is up, it'll take days before the gases build up to a dangerous level.
Zek.
We are experiencing unprecedented shutdown of the machine and fan.
Requesting immediate emergency facility repair team.
Reason for the shutdown is unknown.
A fan is down.
How does that make sense?
With Auxilisun systems, a fan cannot go down unless...
Someone sabotaged it.
Signing off.
I don't like him being here.
He's handcuffed.
You don't know him like I do.
Look, why don't you let me watch him for a while.
No, I got it.
You've got a job to do.
It's under control.
You can't just stand here all night watching him.
I got this.
He wakes up... he moves... call me.
- Wha...
- It's...
It's okay.
- What?
- It's okay.
What is this...
What is this place?
Where am I?
You're at Auxilisun Gibson Desert North.
- Gibson Desert North?
- Robinson.
He's awake.
Robinson.
Robinson?
Oh.
Okay.
- Okay?
- Thank God.
Wha...
What?
Why am I...
I'm Abby Dixon.
I'm the facilities engineer from Auxilisun.
I was flown in.
What happened to me?
Just relax, and, uh, we'll get you up to speed.
- Uh...
- Dr. Sale told me to say hello.
Dr. Jeffrey Sale?
Three years in his class, and then I was his intern.
He got me my first job interview at Auxilisun.
He told me to tell you hi.
Oh.
We haven't talked since I came here.
Jeffrey and I got our master's together.
I was in his wedding party.
Yeah.
He's got some very nice things to say about you.
He made 'em up then.
Well, he says that you are the most brilliant nuclear containment scientist that he's ever had the pleasure to meet.
Here.
Hello.
Thank you, Robinson.
You're welcome.
How do you feel?
What's this for?
Do you not remember what happened with the night that you left?
I can't recall.
- You went a little crazy.
- You had a nervous breakdown.
So that is, unfortunately, the reason why you're in handcuffs.
For our safety, but primarily for your safety.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm not feeling well.
I'm gonna lie down.
Yeah, right.
Relax.
Do you have a, um, personal hygiene kit?
I just think... it'd make Dr. Zek feel a lot better to not have a week's worth of desert filth all over him.
- You want me to go get it?
- I'll be fine.
Two minutes.
Dr. Zek?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Come here.
I have to know that I can trust you.
Well, of course you can trust me.
Dr. Jeffrey Sale's son, tell me about him.
He's in his... 20s.
He just got married.
I haven't actually met him in person, but...
Tell me the truth about Jeffrey Sale's son, now.
He's not Dr. Sale's real son.
His wife was pregnant when he met her, but I'm not supposed to tell anyone that.
- Nobody knows that.
- I know.
I know.
Except people worth trusting.
Okay.
That man isn't Robinson Scott.
What?
Dr. Zek, you acted like you knew him.
Well, I had to.
I'm handcuffed here.
The only reason he's not killing me is because you think that he's Robinson Scott.
Okay, look.
The other night, I was in my lab, alone.
I was working.
And then suddenly, there was a breach.
And Robinson...
the real Robinson Scott, he went out to check it out, and he was obviously overpowered by this guy.
And then this man, he found me.
I left Robinson.
So if this isn't...
Robinson Scott, then how did this person get here?
We're in the middle of the red zone.
I have no idea.
He must have been dropped in.
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
Do you know anything about what he wants?
We need to get out of here.
We don't have much time.
So when's your next scheduled pickup?
I told them that I'd contact them.
Shit.
Are the comms still down?
Yes, but the antenna on your buggy.
I can hot-wire it, use the universal comm hub to get a signal.
Good.
Then you send out a Code 7 distress call, but you can't let him know that you sent it.
As long as he believes that you don't know the truth, we'll be okay.
We will.
And why wouldn't he just kill us?
And he hasn't tried to kill you yet?
He needs you for something.
I'm setting up my two-way tuned into my frequency.
So while I'm gone, if he comes back,
I'll hear everything that happens.
Good.
Thanks.
Abby.
Yeah.
We can do this.
Abby, he's here.
He's coming.
Okay.
Here we go.
Where?
Where?
We have a problem.
Robinson is not Robinson.
Somebody broke into the facility.
That's why Dr. Zek attempted to escape.
We need help immediately.
So lie back.
Just lay your head back.
There.
Must feel nice.
Get that desert grime off you.
If you just put your hand down.
Gotta keep you handcuffed for your own safety, Dr. Zek.
I know.
These razors are incredibly sharp.
Try and think that you're in one of those old movies... in a barbershop.
Where's Abby?
She went to my office, to my lab, to get my tablet.
Just gonna...
Yeah, that looks like it's gonna work just fine.
Ah, yeah.
Okay.
I'm actually gonna have to just lean you back a little further.
Just can't quite reach those...
- Oh, no.
- Difficult areas.
You-You don't have to do my neck.
Relax.
Just relax.
- Robinson?
- Just finishing up here.
Much better.
Done.
You do look much better.
Here.
You forgot my tablet.
Your lab was such a mess, I couldn't find it.
You'll have to give me better directions.
Oh.
Yeah, of course.
Dr. Zek, you've had quite a day.
I know.
Think you could maybe use a little rest?
- Hmm?
No, no, no.
- I'll give you this to relax.
I don't...
- Put him down, Robinson.
- Okay.
Just keep an eye on him.
He was extremely nervous.
Well done for knocking him out like that.
I just thought we would both sleep a little easier knowing that he was drugged asleep.
Yeah.
He doesn't seem to remember anything.
You believe him?
Does he seem dangerous to you?
Well...
Things aren't always what they seem.
Hmm?
- Shh.
- What's happening?
- I had to inject you to wake you up.
- Where's the guy?
He's sleeping.
We gotta get out of here.
Look away.
- Did you send the signal?
- Not yet.
That's where we're headed.
We have to get out of here.
It's gonna take 40 minutes for them to get here.
- We'll wait outside.
Okay.
- Okay, let's go.
Too late.
What are you doing, Abby?
You're not Robinson Scott.
What are you talking about?
- Dr. Zek...
- Stay still!
- Dr. Zek told me...
- Abby.
Abby.
The doctor, eh?
You trust the good doctor?
Is that how it works?
You tell the truth.
You tell her the truth right now!
What's he talking about?
The ravings of a madman.
You tell her about Gibson Desert North.
About Auxilisun's crown jewel, now!
- What?
- Tell her.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
And you're willing to bet our lives on that, are you?
Um, yeah.
Ow!
Aaah!
Aaah!
- Let me see.
- Am I bleeding?
Looks like the laser cauterized the wound.
Come here.
Aaah!
To the bed.
Here.
What did he say about me?
Don't touch it.
He told me you were some kind of terrorist that broke in here and killed the real Robinson.
You believed him?
Dr. Zek is a respected member of the scientific community.
- What was I supposed to think?
- Dr. Zek is a lunatic.
How am I gonna get across the red zone?
How am I gonna get across the size of that desert?
I'd have radiation poisoning by the time I got here.
He destroyed the door mechanism.
We're locked in here.
- He's gonna escape without us.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He's not escaping.
He's going to Deep Burial.
Bastard.
Just...
Hmm.
What did you mean?
When you said that...
That this whole place was a lie.
- It hurts.
- What did you mean?
This place is supposed to be a secure nuclear storage facility.
He's turned it into a bomb.
Thanks.
Abby, I don't...
I don't know what we do now.
- How do we get to him?
- He's in Deep Burial.
I have access.
- You do?
- Yeah.
That's great.
Hang on.
Okay.
I'm gonna rewire the door, so the mechanism works from this side.
You can do that?
Nice.
Watch out.
We need to find him.
I can trace his location on my tablet.
No time for that!
No time!
Fuck.
- Drop the club.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- Okay, okay.
You're the one with radiation sickness.
- You walked across the red zone?
- Shut up!
- Who are you?
Please.
- Shut up.
- Who are you?
- Shut up!
Nothing can stop me from doing what I came here to do!
Aaah!
Aaah!
What are you doing?
Gibson Desert North has been decaying at an unpredictable rate for years, and you knew it!
You know that Auxilisun system's fail-safe.
There's no way...
What about Barrow Creek?
All of the closest inhabitable cities are supposed to be well within the green zone.
So unless Barrow Creek... the entire town... got up and moved, the red zone is expanding.
Yes.
When were you gonna tell Auxilisun?
Auxilisun already knows.
What?
Dr. Sale and I know the truth.
- The truth?
- Yeah.
The truth that you're killing people?
The truth is that the energy we give the world is more important than some piece-of-shit small town...
But no, people di...
in the middle of nowhere!
His...
That man's family.
How many have lived?
Do you know how many hospitals, cities, homes use our energy?
There were 230 assholes in Barrow Creek!
Shut up!
Aaah!
Shut up, okay?
You can find your own way out.
Abby.
So you were the one that was ruining the fans.
You walked across the red zone by yourself?
How long have you been dying?
Not sure.
We all got sick at the same time.
I just lasted longer than Margot,
and Sammy.
This won't bring them back.
I know what it's like to lose your family.
Then you know why I have to do this.
No.
You're just gonna kill more people.
I can't let you...
- Don't follow me, Abby.
- Stop.
Stay back!
Stop!
No!
Stay back, Abby!
Stop.
Auxilisun, they took everything from me.
If you destroy this place, you're no better than they are.
And you are?
- No.
- The world needs a tragedy, to see what's been happening here.
I'll kill you before I let that happen.
No, you won't.
If we can get out of here,
I have all the information on my ADATA.
You and I, we can blow the whistle.
We can let everybody know.
No, Abby.
They'll shut you down, Abby!
This thing's bigger than you!
The whole world, Abby!
They're being lied to!
Is this what Margot and Sammy would have wanted?
Not sure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get a chance to ask 'em.
No!
This is CTE Abby Dixon to Auxilisun tri-copter.
Rhine, do you read me?
[male narrator] Auxilisun meets the high demands of your busy day with affordable, renewable energy.
But it wasn't always the power choice for 99% of the world's governing economic bodies.
Auxilisun was born from innovation required after the three-plant meltdown turned the world away from nuclear energy.
Oil barons and green extremists drove energy costs higher and higher, resulting in the energy crisis of 2018.
The world descended into chaos until Auxilisun introduced the tri-fission engine.
An Auxilisun containment facility was constructed over the three-plant disaster site, so the tri-fission engine could clean up the dangerous radiation.
Progress was slow.
But independent scientific studies prove that Auxilisun's miraculous tri-fission engine not only worked, but it also created new energy from the radiation it was cleaning, and thus began the energy revolution of 2025.
No more dirty biofuels, inconsistent wind or expensive solar.
Tri-fission engines clean up old waste while Auxilisun continues to build its next-generation plants across the world.
Today nuclear energy, powers everything you do, and Auxilisun is there to make sure it stays safe, sustainable, and, most importantly, affordable.
Auxilisun...
Creating a new future by cleaning up the past.
[clunking]
[whirring]
- [beeping] - [gasps] [beeping continues]
Lights on.
[beeping continues]
[sighs]
Alarm off.
[Beeping stops]
[line ringing]
CSE Dixon, it's the middle of the night.
David, communications are down with both of the field techs...
It's Christmas Day.
Is this something that can wait until tomorrow?
Gibson Desert North is the largest nuclear waste repository in the southern hemisphere.
It doesn't take the day off.
Something's wrong.
We don't have anyone available.
- I'll go.
- What?
You don't have anyone available.
I'm going out there myself.
Call the transpo.
I'll be ready in ten.
Coming in on the red zone now.
Completely uninhabitable.
You do not wanna lose your fuel out here.
So Auxilisun's sending a tech assistant to a facility this remote.
No chief engineers available?
I am a chief tech engineer.
[chuckles]
- How many facilities you engineered?
- None.
I was recently promoted.
My work's been lab-based.
Live view up.
Now, that's what a real-life Auxilisun containment facility looks like.
You don't see that in a lab.
This your first flight schedule too?
There's nothing in here about a pickup.
We've lost communication to Gibson Desert North.
Once I get them back up, I'll contact Auxilisun HQ for a pickup and request that they don't send you.

Abby Dixon reporting.
I.D. HEB0511.
Entry 001.
Upon my entry into the facility, no employee response.
The facility itself is in a state of disrepair, possibly deserted.
I will log my entries and upload them as soon as I get the comms back online.
[clinking]
Hello!
- [Abby gasps]
- Who are you?
I'm a technical facility engineer from Auxilisun.
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing here?
Your communications are down.
I'm here to get you back online.
Some ID?
Can I see some ID?
I can't connect to openwork.
Openwork's not worth shit down here.
- Do you have a scanner?
- There's a scanner.
There.
On the table.
Yeah.
[sighs] [scanner beeps]
Mm-hmm.
- Happy?
- Mm-hmm.
My name's Dixon.
Abby Dixon.
How'd you get here?
I was just dropped off by a company tri-copter.
Just you?
Yeah.
- Just you.
- Just me.
Mm-hmm.
I'll be here long enough to get you back online.
Which one are you?
Zek or Robinson.
Robinson.
I'm Robinson.
Yeah.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Making noises in the corridor.
They don't teach you how to knock at Auxilisun HQ?
Where's Dr. Zek?
He's out.
What do you mean "out"?
Where?
Does surveys.
In the desert.
I don't know.
It's not my job.
Well, when will he be back?
He didn't say.
Took the buggy.
[sighs]
- [Klaxon blaring]
- What is that?
It's nothing.
I got it under control.
What do you mean it's nothing?
It's...
It's obviously something.
It's not.
[blaring continues] What are you talking about?
Right here it says, "Error code 8627B."
What does that mean?
What's the procedure?
Mm-hmm.
[blaring continues] The procedure is you need to chill out.
Okay, this is not a joke.
This is a sophisticated facility, and I'm here to assess the communication breakdown, and this could potentially be a communication... [blaring stops]
I pulled that lever.
Did you see me pull that lever?
It resets the system.
Yeah.
It makes all these red lights go green.
I told you I had it under control.
Hmm?
[Chuckles]
Will you at least show me to my room?
Mm.
I wasn't...
Expecting guests.
I'm sure you'll love your accommodations.
[Robinson grunting]
All right.
General...
Common area.
Um, kitchen, obviously.
And up those stairs is the sunroom.
Doesn't look like it gets much use.
No.
Um, not really the tanning type.
Right.
But that's not the point.
- The sunrooms were designed...
- To provide a certain amount of UV, to keep your mind in the right...
My mental health is fine, thank you.
- Is this sick bay?
- Yeah.
Your own doctor as well.
It's kind of fun.
So... this...
Yeah, that's you.
Guest quarters.
It's not much, but you know...
Maid comes at 10:00 a.m. for a fluff and fold.
Merry Christmas.
[sighs]
[whirring, clanging]
Robinson?
[bat squeaking, wings flapping]
Robinson?
[guitar strumming]
Robinson.
[strumming]
Oh.
Hello.
Wow.
I didn't realize this was gonna be a formal occasion.
I would've shaved my face.
What's that?
In case I need to reach you in the facility.
Aw, you don't need that.
You're never too far away.
So this is what you came here to see, huh?
[beeping, whirring] [beeping]
[beeping, whirring] [beeping] [beeping, whirring]
- What's wrong with it?
- [beeping]
Ah, I very much enjoyed our conversation.
I was feeling a little lonely before you turned up.
You are just a breath of fresh air.
I'm not here to talk.
I'm here to fix your facility.
Yes.
What's that?
Universal comm unit.
The nerve center for our whole communication array.
How do you not know this?
The thing's a dinosaur.
Like everything else around here.
Gibson Desert North is not a dinosaur.
It's the prototype that our entire company is hinged on.
And our proudest achievement.
Oh.
Well, then that's just a little bit sad.
[whirring]
[strumming continues]
So?
[low humming]
Sorry.
Can you fix it?
There's no power.
I have batteries.
I'm gonna have to run a diagnostics scan on the entire facility to see where the breakdown in the system is.
Diagnostics scan, huh?
Yeah.
Yeesh.
Would you mind showing me to the machine room?
Sure.
[strumming stops]
Now.
Don't touch the guitar, please.
[sighs]
What facility do you work at?
I don't work at any one particular facility.
I'm based at HQ.
Oh.
So you don't know anything about SDP then.
Sensory deprivation psychosis.
I came up with that.
What is it?
Well, you know, you spend too much on your own in a place like this.
No windows...
You go a little...
You go a little psycho, you know.
I mean...
That's why we give psychological profiles to all of our employees
- before they get the job.
- Yeah.
Well, it's not that simple.
When did you say Dr. Zek is gonna be back?
I didn't.
Well, you have to know something about his schedule.
No.
I mean, you know, he works in a completely different part of the compound, behind a locked door.
He's the one with the Ph.D., remember.
I stay out of his way, take out the trash.
And he just goes out every now and again?
Look, I'm not the boss.
He is.
I'm not his mum.
That's not what I'm suggesting.
I'm just...
We're almost here.
It's through here to his lab?
Yeah, yeah.
It's down the end of this corridor.
Get a chance to, uh, see Dr. Zek's crazy scientific experiments up close.
I've read his reports.
There's nothing in Dr. Zek's work that is outside of company parameters.
Oh, yeah?
Why does he do it all behind a locked door?
Never lets me in.
You're obviously creating some kind of fantasy.
Is this the isolation psychosis you're talking about?
No.
Well, maybe.
Take a look at his lab.
It'll bore you to death.
[lock opens] Just don't touch anything.
Oh.
Wow!
That... is something.
[whirring]
Is this where they keep all the shit?
The shit?
Nuclear shit.
No.
The waste is kept in Deep Burial, behind those doors.
You think this place is impressive?
Deep Burial is ten times the size.
What's this then?
The cooling system.
Maglev fan built to last 200,000 years.
But that's nothing compared to this.
This is the real secret to Auxilisun's success.
The tri-fission engine.
It takes the energy from the radioactive decay in Deep Burial and powers the fans.
I should have access.
This fan breaks down, guess who has to fix it.
That's impossible.
If both fans stopped, then this place would fill up with gas so fast, it would be like a stick of nuclear dynamite.
And never in the history of Auxilisun has even one fan broken down.
It's a brilliant design.
How come the only access through it is through this doggy door?
Robotics are the only thing that can fix a tri-fission engine.
Even in a hazmat suit, there's so much radiation, you'd be dead in 48 hours.
You should know that.
Where's the other fan?
Down in Deep Burial.
We're in the part of the facility that needs "golden ticket" access to enter.
- Just looking.
- Okay.
You need level-14 access to get down into Deep Burial sites.
Oh.
What are you, level 18 or something?
When they zap us with the scanners, we just get the basic package.
You know.
Office, bedroom.
- Shitters.
- Did you fix the comms?
No.
All the fuses and the cabling are all intact, so the problem must be somewhere between here and there.
Hmm.
You're gonna show me Deep Burial?
No.
No one goes down into Deep Burial.
Dr. Zek.
He goes into Deep Burial.
You're mistaken.
I hear him down there all the time.
Every time he opens that door, it rumbles the whole facility.
You're wrong.
[chuckles] You think I'm making this up?
No.
I think you're confused.
Dr. Zek doesn't even have fingertip access to Deep Burial.
You sure about that?
[coughing]
[coughing continues] [body thuds]
Robinson?
[clanging]
Jesus!
Robinson!
Robinson!
What?
Wha...
- What?
- Are you okay?
- You're hitting me.
- I'm sorry.
- I just fell.
- What happened?
[groans] Just a long day, you know?
I need some sleep maybe.
Do you generally pass out when you're tired?
Well, I didn't really pass out.
I just had a moment of...
What are you doing?
I'm fine.
When was the last time you requested a medical exam?
I don't need a medical exam.
[footsteps departing]
Abby Dixon.
Entry 002.
I arrived this morning to find Dr. Darius Zek, the chief scientific executive, absent, surveying the surrounding area.
But that is unconfirmed.
The facility's caretaker, Robinson Scott, was uncooperative.
The comms are still down, but my preliminary tests as to why were inconclusive.
I've never seen an Auxilisun facility like this.
It's... neglected.
And Robinson Scott...
I don't know who hired him, but... [sighs]
[gasps] [breathes heavily]
[screams] Sor...
Sorry.
[singing]
- Oi.
- Hmm.
Dodgy lock in there.
Sorry about that.
Can you fix it?
Well, there's no point, is there, really.
Not gonna make the same mistake twice.
I'm just not used to having guests.
You carry that thing everywhere, huh?
I heard you talking on it last night.
The walls are quite thin.
Well, I gather information, report back to Auxilisun.
It's my job.
It's protocol.
Is Dr. Zek back?
No.
Is it normal for him to be gone overnight like that?
Sure.
Macchiato.
Oh.
No, not for me.
That is the world's greatest macchiato.
You got to try it.
It's hot.
- Sugar?
- Uh, no.
I'm okay.
Leave her there.
Make me one.
I wanna do a medical diagnostic test on you.
Medical...
Last night...
- No, that thing last night was fine.
- Uh, no.
You can have serious health problems.
Here.
That's very sweet, but I am fine.
Now I'm fine.
When I was younger, I had a thing.
My kidneys.
Gone now.
I'm fine.
Was it from drinking?
It was cassies mainly.
Some drinking.
I have a sister, Margot.
She was...
She's... your age.
She sobered me up.
Took care of me.
Got me better.
Got me off it.
Everyone else left me behind.
She saw me right.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's gone.
Don't drink the water.
It's not good.
It's excellent.
You're crazy.
Do you not want yours?
It's all yours.
Two cups of coffee for me.
Watch out.
Cheers.
I was cleaning out this old guy's place, right?
This was something that we used to do when they got kicked out of their places.
And it was something that I could kind of do, when I was a little high and stuff, you know.
Easy kind of job to do.
So cleaning out this guy's place, throwing away his clothes and furniture and things he's not gonna need.
And then I see at one point he's got a bunch of CD's.
- So I'm thinking, "Oh, that's cool."
- Bunch of what?
He has a bunch of CD's.
Um, compound discs.
Uh, compact discs.
You know, the little music.
- Little silver disc things.
- Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like old turn-of-the-century music.
And he's got some stuff that I kind of recognize.
Like Oasis.
Remember?
Shed Seven.
Um... [clears throat] East 17.
So I'm thinking while I'm cleaning this house out, I'm gonna play some music.
I'm looking through his music.
"I'm gonna pick that.
I'm gonna pick that." And this bag falls out.
So I'm thinking, "Oh, well, you know, he's kind of hiding that bag."
In this little zip bag.
So what's inside here?
I don't really know that much about turn-of-the-century music.
Do know a little bit about retro kind of drugs and stuff.
So I look inside and there's this... this crystal, this rock, you know.
Like, "Hello!
Yes.
Know what that is.
Crack cocaine."
So run around the house.
Run around the house.
Like, make sure I'm kind of safe doing it.
Like, I need, like, a lighter and a little bit of aluminum foil and a little glass pipe type thing.
Get that all going.
You know, I'll do it.
Put it all in and break off a little bit of crack.
Put it in the pipe thing and then...
[imitating flame]
Kind of fire it up.
Wait.
Nothing.
Now, you're talking about maybe, like, two, three minutes or so.
You should be off.
You should be, like, away, doing it.
Nothing.
So I think, "Well, maybe it's like weak crack or something."
So break off a little more, put it in the thing.
Get the lighter... [imitating flame] Kind of fire it up.
Nothing.
I end up smoking the whole piece of crack.
That's a lot of crack.
That is a lot of crack.
Nothing.
Like, 20, 25 minutes in, man, I get pounded by this, like, headache.
Just like my head gets filled with cement or something like that.
Kind of feel a little sick.
The next thing I know, I pass out on someone else's, like, floor.
It's not even my house.
I'm out, like this.
And the next thing I know, the owner of the house, this old geezer, the guy whose house we're clearing out, like, wakes me up.
So I get roused and, you know, I look around.
I'm trying to save face a little bit, but he sees...
He totally sees what I'm doing.
He can see all the stuff.
You know what he says?
"My grandma brought that back in 1991, you just smoked a piece of the Berlin Wall."
[laughing] [babbling]
Oh, man.
Is that...
Like smoking history or something.
Went to hospital...
I was in hospital for two days, on my own.
And then, you know, ended up my sister came.
Kind of gave me a little bit of a talking to.
"Clean up your life.
You need to make some changes" kind of thing.
It's actually what brought me here.
She kind of...
She and I agreed to come out here, you know.
[beeping]
What about you?
Me?
Yeah, you know, family.
People you talk to, friends.
No.
No.
No family.
No family?
You an orphan, raised by Auxilisun?
No.
I mean, uh, I have a dad.
But... technically, I don't talk to him.
What is this?
I was just trying to make a friend.
Okay, so... holidays roll around, you know, your birthday.
What do you...
Do you go for lunch on your own?
Play solitaire?
Just nap all day?
I have friends.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I'm skeptical.
- Name them.
Name your friends.
- Tesla and Jobs.
- What type of names are those?
- That's...
Come on.
- They're my dogs.
They...
- They're your dogs' names?
[laughs] Come on.
What do you have?
Like little "wee wee wee wee"...
little yappy tiny little things that fits in a little...
like a little bag of sugar?
This is not adding up.
The becquerel levels are higher than they should be.
I think your calibrations are off.
Hmm.
Well, maybe someone's been in Deep Burial.
Hmm.
- What?
- No single person, no one, not even someone like Dr. Zek, could create a spike like this.
I mean, it's got to be your gear.
It's not calibrated.
I'll leave you to it.
You'll work it out.
Dr. Zek is still missing.
I'm worried about his safety.
And there's... a problem.
According to this data, the red zone is expanding, which I know is not possible.
It must be just a misreading with the gear.
Robinson is not as skilled as I would expect.
[sighs] I will recalibrate the meters myself.
[torch hissing]
[whirring]
[Abby gasps]
- [Robinson] What are you looking at?
- [gasps] Jesus!
Oh.
Sorry.
I was gonna go on the roof, hit some balls.
I thought I saw a man in the desert.
Okay.
May I?
Sure.
Hmm.
I don't see anything.
What if it's Zek?
What if...
What if he's out there and he's hurt and he needs our help?
I don't think Zek's coming back.
He's been gone four days.
No.
You said he left yesterday.
I didn't say that.
What are you not telling me?
He kind of lost it.
Sensory deprivation psychosis.
Big time.
I don't know if it was the isolation or the tests he was running.
Maybe he was exposed to radiation in Deep Burial.
But, you know, he's went a little...
And then the last night before...
You know, I'm gonna go hit some balls on the roof.
No.
No, listen.
The power lines were intentionally severed.
He cut them?
Tell me what happened.
You know, most of the time, just ignore him.
I stay in the control room.
He does what he wants.
Fine.
And then before he left, he just...
Screaming.
Just screaming down that corridor.
It was getting louder and louder, at me.
"You did it.
You did it.
You broke...
You damaged it.
You broke the fan.
You broke the fan."
He's pointing at me and accusing me and shouting.
He's a scary guy.
And I ran.
I ran and I hid.
And I heard the doors go, up top.
He took the buggy.
I don't...
I mean...
I don't know how he'd survive out there.
I mean, I'm telling you, I saw something.
Yeah, well, you know, that... that could be... this place.
It's the walls.
Ground.
The air...
Gets in you.
Hmm.
How have you been sleeping?
You've been dreaming?
Have you been dreaming?
Hmm.
Hmm.
You can spend as much time as you want in that sunroom.
But it gets inside your mind.
I'm gonna go play golf.
[sighs]
[clunking]
[beeping]
[pinging] [gasps]
Robinson?
[door opening]
[Klaxon blaring]
[breathing heavily]
[gasping]
[breathes heavily]
[grunts]
- [beeping]
- Robinson.
Robinson, it... it's Zek.
Can you hear...
Can you hear me?
Open the door!
[Robinson on comm] I'm not sure I should override the system.
We're both gonna die if you don't open this door right now!
[breathing heavily]
[banging]
[door opening]
[Robinson] We don't know his state of radiation exposure.
We don't have time to discuss this.
Help me move him.
[golf club clattering]
Go inside.
I got him.
I think this is a mistake, Abby.
Go inside.
Go!
Go!
[grunting]
What the hell was that?
I'm just following contamination policy.
It's Dr. Zek.
You don't know it's Dr. Zek.
You don't.
Who else could it be?
We're in the red zone, 300 kilometers from the nearest town.
Well?
Yeah, it's Dr. Zek.
- How is he?
- His pulse is even.
Is it?
He was pretty exposed out there.
What's that?
Hexomorphone.
[Air cartridge hisses] [gasps]
It should help combat the symptoms of radiation poisoning.
Hmm.
Didn't get very far, did he?
I don't know.
Maybe he came back.
[sighs] What happened to you?
[door opens, closes]
What is that?
- Precaution.
- He's dangerous, isn't he?
He's in a coma.
Well, you wake up from a coma.
- Okay.
- You need some help?
Why don't you just go back to the control room.
It's good, you know.
He's back.
That's the important thing.
[door opens, closes]
[sighs] [birds tweeting]
[clicking, hissing]
[clicking, hissing continue]
[cries out, gasps]
[sighs] [gasps] Wha...
You were screaming.
I was concerned.
It was just a nightmare.
About your dad?
You said his name.
It's this place.
I'm fine.
Could've fooled me.
My dad euthanized my grandmother when I was seven.
[Klaxon blaring]
[blaring continues]
[Robinson coughs]
Fan's not working.
Look, look!
N-No, that's impossible.
Just reset the console.
All of your readings have been off.
[Abby] I'm sure that's it.
[blaring stops] [machinery whirring]
Whew.
Okay.
That helped, but look.
It's still...
It's not movin'.
Okay.
[Beeping]
I'm gonna check it out.
You just... stay here.
Okay.
[door opens]
[machinery rumbling]
[Robinson] What happened?
Did you go back in there?
Huh?
What?
[Abby] The fan.
I can't.
I don't have access.
Remember?
What are you accusing me of?
I'm sorry.
It...
It's not possible, unless somebody sabotaged the engine room.
It just... it can't... it can't happen.
[sighs]
I need to get the comms back up.
Get back in touch with HQ.
This is beyond me now.
Okay, how serious is it?
Do we need to evacuate?
No.
As long as the other fan is up, it'll take days before the gases build up to a dangerous level.
Zek.
We are experiencing unprecedented shutdown of the machine and fan.
Requesting immediate emergency facility repair team.
Reason for the shutdown is unknown.
A fan is down.
How does that make sense?
With Auxilisun systems, a fan cannot go down unless...
Someone sabotaged it.
Signing off.
[strumming]
I don't like him being here.
He's handcuffed.
You don't know him like I do.
[plucking guitar string]
Look, why don't you let me watch him for a while.
No, I got it.
You've got a job to do.
It's under control.
You can't just stand here all night watching him.
I got this.
He wakes up... he moves... call me.
[plays guitar]
[sighing]
[heart monitor beeping] [clicking, hissing]
- Wha...
- It's...
It's okay.
- What?
- It's okay.
What is this...
What is this place?
Where am I?
You're at Auxilisun Gibson Desert North.
- Gibson Desert North?
- Robinson.
He's awake.
Robinson.
Robinson?
Oh.
[chuckles] Okay.
- Okay?
- Thank God.
Wha...
What?
Why am I...
I'm Abby Dixon.
I'm the facilities engineer from Auxilisun.
I was flown in.
What happened to me?
Just relax, and, uh, we'll get you up to speed.
- [Zek] Uh...
- Dr. Sale told me to say hello.
Dr. Jeffrey Sale?
Three years in his class, and then I was his intern.
He got me my first job interview at Auxilisun.
[chuckles] He told me to tell you hi.
Oh.
We haven't talked since I came here.
Jeffrey and I got our master's together.
I was in his wedding party.
Yeah.
He's got some very nice things to say about you.
He made 'em up then.
[laughs] Well, he says that you are the most brilliant nuclear containment scientist that he's ever had the pleasure to meet.
[Abby] Here.
[Panting]
Hello.
Thank you, Robinson.
You're welcome.
How do you feel?
[handcuffs rattle] What's this for?
Do you not remember what happened with the night that you left?
I can't recall.
- You went a little crazy.
- You had a nervous breakdown.
[Robinson] So that is, unfortunately, the reason why you're in handcuffs.
For our safety, but primarily for your safety.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm not feeling well.
I'm gonna lie down.
[Robinson] Yeah, right.
Relax.
Do you have a, um, personal hygiene kit?
I just think... it'd make Dr. Zek feel a lot better to not have a week's worth of desert filth all over him.
- You want me to go get it?
- I'll be fine.
Two minutes.
[door opens, closes]
Dr. Zek?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Come here.
I have to know that I can trust you.
Well, of course you can trust me.
Dr. Jeffrey Sale's son, tell me about him.
He's in his... 20s.
He just got married.
I haven't actually met him in person, but...
Tell me the truth about Jeffrey Sale's son, now.
He's not Dr. Sale's real son.
[sighs] His wife was pregnant when he met her, but I'm not supposed to tell anyone that.
- Nobody knows that.
- I know.
I know.
Except people worth trusting.
[sighing] Okay.
That man isn't Robinson Scott.
What?
Dr. Zek, you acted like you knew him.
Well, I had to.
I'm handcuffed here.
The only reason he's not killing me is because you think that he's Robinson Scott.
Okay, look.
The other night, I was in my lab, alone.
I was working.
And then suddenly, there was a breach.
And Robinson...
the real Robinson Scott, he went out to check it out, and he was obviously overpowered by this guy.
And then this man, he found me.
I left Robinson.
So if this isn't...
Robinson Scott, then how did this person get here?
We're in the middle of the red zone.
I have no idea.
He must have been dropped in.
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
Do you know anything about what he wants?
We need to get out of here.
We don't have much time.
So when's your next scheduled pickup?
I told them that I'd contact them.
Shit.
Are the comms still down?
Yes, but the antenna on your buggy.
I can hot-wire it, use the universal comm hub to get a signal.
Good.
Then you send out a Code 7 distress call, but you can't let him know that you sent it.
As long as he believes that you don't know the truth, we'll be okay.
We will.
And why wouldn't he just kill us?
And he hasn't tried to kill you yet?
He needs you for something.
I'm setting up my two-way tuned into my frequency.
So while I'm gone, if he comes back,
I'll hear everything that happens.
Good.
Thanks.
Abby.
Yeah.
We can do this.
[child giggling]
[beep] [Zek on comm] Abby, he's here.
He's coming.
Okay.
Here we go.
Where?
[chuckles] Where?
[beeping]
We have a problem.
Robinson is not Robinson.
Somebody broke into the facility.
That's why Dr. Zek attempted to escape.
We need help immediately.
So lie back.
Just lay your head back.
There.
Must feel nice.
Get that desert grime off you.
If you just put your hand down.
Gotta keep you handcuffed for your own safety, Dr. Zek.
I know.
These razors are incredibly sharp.
Try and think that you're in one of those old movies... in a barbershop.
Where's Abby?
She went to my office, to my lab, to get my tablet.
Just gonna...
Yeah, that looks like it's gonna work just fine.
Ah, yeah.
Okay.
I'm actually gonna have to just lean you back a little further.
Just can't quite reach those...
- Oh, no.
- Difficult areas.
You-You don't have to do my neck.
[Robinson over comm] Relax.
[Robinson] Just relax.
- Robinson?
- Just finishing up here.
[Robinson] Much better.
Done.
You do look much better.
Here.
You forgot my tablet.
Your lab was such a mess, I couldn't find it.
You'll have to give me better directions.
Oh.
Yeah, of course.
[Abby] Dr. Zek, you've had quite a day.
I know.
Think you could maybe use a little rest?
- Hmm?
No, no, no.
- I'll give you this to relax.
I don't...
[exhales]
- Put him down, Robinson.
- Okay.
Just keep an eye on him.
He was extremely nervous.
Well done for knocking him out like that.
I just thought we would both sleep a little easier knowing that he was drugged asleep.
Yeah.
He doesn't seem to remember anything.
You believe him?
Does he seem dangerous to you?
Well...
Things aren't always what they seem.
Hmm?
[door opens, closes]
[snores, groans]
- Shh.
- What's happening?
- I had to inject you to wake you up.
- Where's the guy?
He's sleeping.
We gotta get out of here.
Look away.
- Did you send the signal?
- Not yet.
That's where we're headed.
[Abby] We have to get out of here.
It's gonna take 40 minutes for them to get here.
- We'll wait outside.
Okay.
- Okay, let's go.
- Too late.
- [Abby gasps]
What are you doing, Abby?
[Abby] You're not Robinson Scott.
What are you talking about?
- Dr. Zek...
- Stay still!
- Dr. Zek told me...
- [Zek] Abby.
Abby.
The doctor, eh?
You trust the good doctor?
Is that how it works?
You tell the truth.
You tell her the truth right now!
What's he talking about?
The ravings of a madman.
You tell her about Gibson Desert North.
About Auxilisun's crown jewel, now!
- What?
- Tell her.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
And you're willing to bet our lives on that, are you?
- Um, yeah.
- [Abby grunts]
[Abby shrieks] Ow!
Aaah!
[Robinson grunts] Aaah!
[Robinson groaning]
- Let me see.
- Am I bleeding?
Looks like the laser cauterized the wound.
Come here.
Aaah!
[grunts] To the bed.
Here.
What did he say about me?
[Grunts]
Don't touch it.
He told me you were some kind of terrorist that broke in here and killed the real Robinson.
You believed him?
Dr. Zek is a respected member of the scientific community.
- What was I supposed to think?
- Dr. Zek is a lunatic.
How am I gonna get across the red zone?
How am I gonna get across the size of that desert?
I'd have radiation poisoning by the time I got here.
He destroyed the door mechanism.
[door warbles]
We're locked in here.
- He's gonna escape without us.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He's not escaping.
He's going to Deep Burial.
[Robinson grunts, gasps]
Bastard.
Just...
Hmm.
What did you mean?
When you said that...
That this whole place was a lie.
- It hurts.
- What did you mean?
This place is supposed to be a secure nuclear storage facility.
He's turned it into a bomb.
Thanks.
Abby, I don't...
I don't know what we do now.
- How do we get to him?
- He's in Deep Burial.
I have access.
- You do?
- Yeah.
That's great.
Hang on.
Okay.
I'm gonna rewire the door, so the mechanism works from this side.
[grunts] [instrument clattering]
[Robinson] You can do that?
[beeps] [grunts]
[Robinson] Nice.
[Robinson grunts] Watch out.
We need to find him.
I can trace his location on my tablet.
No time for that!
[Robinson] No time!
[tablet beeping]
[gasping]
Fuck.
[beeping, whirring]
- [Robinson grunts] - [Zek shouting]
[grunting] [gun powers up]
- Drop the club.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- Okay, okay.
[Robinson, Abby groaning]
[coughs, retches]
You're the one with radiation sickness.
- You walked across the red zone?
- Shut up!
- Who are you?
Please.
- Shut up.
- Who are you?
- Shut up!
Nothing can stop me from doing what I came here to do!
Aaah!
[groans]
[Klaxon blaring]
[Abby] Aaah!
[gun powers up] What are you doing?
Gibson Desert North has been decaying at an unpredictable rate for years, and you knew it!
You know that Auxilisun system's fail-safe.
There's no way...
What about Barrow Creek?
All of the closest inhabitable cities are supposed to be well within the green zone.
So unless Barrow Creek... the entire town... got up and moved, the red zone is expanding.
Yes.
When were you gonna tell Auxilisun?
Auxilisun already knows.
What?
Dr. Sale and I know the truth.
- The truth?
- Yeah.
The truth that you're killing people?
The truth is that the energy we give the world is more important than some piece-of-shit small town...
But no, people di...
in the middle of nowhere!
His...
That man's family.
How many have lived?
Do you know how many hospitals, cities, homes use our energy?
There were 230 assholes in Barrow Creek!
Shut up!
[Gun powers up]
Aaah!
Shut up, okay?
[gun powers down]
You can find your own way out.
[Klaxon blaring in distance]
[Zek] Abby.
[child giggling on video]
[coughs] So you were the one that was ruining the fans.
You walked across the red zone by yourself?
How long have you been dying?
Not sure.
We all got sick at the same time.
I just lasted longer than Margot,
and Sammy.
This won't bring them back.
I know what it's like to lose your family.
[rumbling]
Then you know why I have to do this.
No.
You're just gonna kill more people.
I can't let you...
- Don't follow me, Abby.
- Stop.
Stay back!
Stop!
No!
Stay back, Abby!
Stop.
Auxilisun, they took everything from me.
If you destroy this place, you're no better than they are.
And you are?
[gasping]
- [Abby] No.
- [Robinson] The world needs a tragedy,
- to see what's been happening here.
- [gun powers up]
I'll kill you before I let that happen.
No, you won't.
[breathing heavily]
If we can get out of here,
I have all the information on my ADATA.
You and I, we can blow the whistle.
We can let everybody know.
No, Abby.
They'll shut you down, Abby!
This thing's bigger than you!
The whole world, Abby!
They're being lied to!
Is this what Margot and Sammy would have wanted?
Not sure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get a chance to ask 'em.
No!

Are you looking to bludgeon or pummel?
[Ugga] Grug, little help!

We lost another taster at Gatherer's Garden, and need all tongues on deck.

Too many problems, too much walking, not enough Grug.
I need more Grug.
But all you do is lie there all flat, Shadow Grug.
[as Shadow Grug] What if you got a better shadow?
Hmm.
Interesting idea.
Go on.
Dad, are you okay?
Eep, please don't interrupt Shadow Grug.
Yeah, you're right.
Eep would be a great shadow.
So while I was totally out of my gourd berry earlier, I had a genius idea on how we can all get the help we need.
It's called shadowing, okay?
Every kid follows an adult's shadow and learns to help with his or her job.
Uh, point of order?
What if your job is becoming one with all there is?
What if your boss is the wind?
Uh, I guess you just do that then.
Eep, you'll be my shadow.
Yes!
Shadowing the leader.
[giggles] So I'm basically like your second-in-command?
Sure.
Now, Bulk, you shadow
Amber.
Womp, uh, you'll be with Old Man Root.
Oh, Womp's allergic to body hair.
[sneezes]
No put Amber daughter with bush person.
I also object to that guy.
Okay, okay!
Everybody calm down.
We'll just make a few swaps.
You move here, and you over here.
Better?
Hope so, 'cause I'm not pausing for feedback, so, bye!
Aah!
Wait!
I'm not gonna learn anything from Old Man Root.
Sorry, Eep, but I can't make someone else's kid spend time with that nutball.
I mean, who knows, he could be dangerous.
'Kay?
So have fun!
Now, who did I end up with?
Paired with the big dog.
Woof, woof.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
I didn't!
Can't wait to help out my valley leader, and ask him a few questions about Eep.
[chuckles] Just kidding.
I got way more than a few.
What's her favorite animal?
How many breaths does she take in a day?
If she were a bird, would she be my bird?
Mmm.
Oh.
There.
Did you hear it?
For the tenth time, hear what?
To tell you would ruin the mystery.
We all come from where?
Oh, wow!
Ugh!
Can't you just teach me something useful, like how to hunt?
Amber teaching style hands-on.
So keep hands on rock, 'cause Amber throw.
I'm a rock.
Now that's teaching.
Oh, I can teach you about buffalippo... droppings.
[sniffs] Mmm.
Wheat grass with just a hint of rotted fruit.
[chuckles] This guy's a foodie.
Ugh!
You wildly misunderstood me.
What about gathering?
Hmm?
Make sure you check the fruit for worms.
They're much better on their own.
Worms aren't for eatin', they're for friending'.
[chuckles] Aren't they, Marvin?
See, worms seem quiet, but up close, they sound like...

Now, the key to babysitting is, whatever they do, just keep sitting.

[inhaling] [laughing]
Mercy.
May look like I'm doin' this for him, but I get a lot out of it, too.
Eep, what is Lerk's deal?
She is so happy.
What is wrong with her?
[sighing]
Eep, check out who's not under a boulder for once.
[laughs] Hint... it's me.
[chuckles] Yeah, Lerk's really positive.
Once, a spider ant laid eggs in her ear, and she said,
"Thanks for the new friends."
You know, she's the one who should be paired with Old Man Root.
They both got a weird thing for worms.
Oh, is that so?
Eep, I have an idea.
[laughs] All right, Dad.
Uh, are you gonna tell me about it or...?
[gasps]
Turnin' over a new leaf.
That's a good one.
[laughs] But seriously, take it one day at a time there, Carl.
Eep, what'd you do?
He was only... [muttering]
- six rings old!
- [groaning]
Eep Crood, how dare you cut down Old Man Root's big planty thing?
Carl is a tree.
I want a new shadow.
Of course.
Sure.
You're coming with me, young lady.
Lerk, you go with shrub person.
Bye, now.
Weird.
[gasping]

All right, we are gonna move these stinkin' boulders without singing about how great it is.
Great. [chuckles] I mean...
- [Sandy babbling]
- Nope.
Talk to the butt 'cause the face ain't listening.
I think we can all agree that shadowing was a huge success.
Yeah, Dad.
Big win.
- Whoo-hoo, yeah!
- I didn't hate it.
I'm a rock.
I used to think today was stupid and bad, but thanks to shadowing...
Never mind.
Here comes a giant worm to make today a disaster again.
- Oh!
- [screaming and shouting]
No.
Not without my babies!
[exertion grunts] [gasping]
Well, never seen a butt do that before.
Maybe you do have what it takes.
[chuckles] You hear that, guys?
I got what it takes.
All right, Eep, time to get rid of this thing.
[grunting]
[both] Come on.
Think of something!
[both] Hide.
[screaming]
Oh, we're worm food.
[grunting]
Whoa, there.
Easy on the doom and gloom, leader man.
Y'all let me fix this.
You're too crazy to fix anything.
Wait.
Old Man Root may be a freak about nature, but maybe he's the nature freak we need.
[growling]
[snarling]
Yep, this dude lived under the old meet-thing spot.
[worm growling]
Uh-huh.
You upset his home.
[worm snorting]
He also has some unresolved issues with his mom.
Ah.
Um.
Oh.
Uh, but this is about his home.
Oh, great.
Even worms have feelings now.
Cool it.
Your complaining is making it angrier.
We gotta lure him away using happy voices.
Ha ha!
Eh?
Come on, try it!
I guess this can't get any worse.
That's the spirit.

[grunting]
Well, I'm back to a long commute, but you're right.
It's not as bad with a smile.
No problem is.
You know, he's actually kinda cute.
[kissing]
Oh!
Never mind!
That's disgusting!
[nervous chuckle] [gasping]
Uh, Mom, is my smile okay?
I just wanna make a good impression on the "nitting" club.
Relax.
All you do in "nitting" club is pick each other's nits.
And it's really just an excuse to gab.
[soft chuckle] So say something interesting and you'll be fine.
Got it?
So, [nervous chuckle] ahem, all you really need to know about me is, um, yeah, I'm really interesting, you know, because I have so many interests and they are all interesting.
[yawns] Sounds fascinating.
Can you name one of those, ahem, interests?
Um, I, uh...
I like, uh... smash fruit, in moderate amounts.
[light chuckle]
Might wanna go easy there, Pram.
- Hmph!
- See?
I'm interesting.
Ooh, did I tell you about my night out clubbing with Bow Chicka Wow Wow?
[chuckle] We clubbed so many prey.
I love clubbing, too.
I club chickuna,
I club pig rat, pretty much every interesting thing out there.
I'm just clubbin' it.
You sure are good at killing things.
Animals, conversations.
Ugga, would you move a bit?
Bit more.
[Pram] Almost there.
[screaming] [grunting]
"Nitting" club tough crowd, eh?
Uh, no, no.
I wasn't, uh...
Ugh.
Amber know that pain.
Low branch not so bad.
Give Amber alone space to watch sunset, admire that day's dying sun, and, uh... [sobbing] have a good cry.
Ugga wanna cry with Amber?
[Ugga] I didn't know what to say, so I just gave a bad excuse and left.
- Really?
What'd you say?
- Nothing.
I actually shouted the word...
"Excuse!" ...and ran.
[sighs] I don't get it.
Why did the "nitting" club force me out?
Simple!
You're boring!
It's okay.
We've all got something.
Grug's got the face of a bear owl's butt,
I'm too gorgeous,
Thunk's got that buzztle nest stuck on his head.
[sighs] The harder I pull, [grunting] the tighter it gets.
Ugga, you're not boring.
Who cares what some "nitting" club thinks?
I do.
I need other people to talk to, since now you're spending so much time leading the valley.
I'm sorry.
I know you guys need me here, but see, everyone in town keeps turning to me with their problems.
Oh, that reminds me, I gotta help Old Man Root cure his gross red rash.
[screams]
He showed me things I will never unsee.
Ooh!
Oh, yeah, I shouldn't say that too loud.
Old Rootsie wouldn't really want anyone to know.
Uh, but I'm sure you'll be fine.
Just be yourself.
Ha!
Be yourself?
Has he met ya?
Spice it up.
So, I wanna apologize for yesterday and let you know my life's actually really, really spicy.
Like, a lot.
Like this jalapeñeapple.
[pained gasp]
Even the sweat burns.
[yawns] Be a dear and sweat your way over there.
- A little more.
- Keep going.
Ugh!
Why are you treating me like Old Man Root and his disgusting rash?
Mm-hmm.
Well, well, I do believe this smash fruit just got juicy.
Do tell.
Um, the rash is red.
And it's everywhere.
[laughing]
Uh, yeah, yeah, I hear all sorts of interesting stuff from my husband, now that he's the leader.
Like... did you hear how Munk fell for Teena?
And he was, like...
[imitating Munk] "Sorry, beautiful lady."
[Ugga] And she was, like... [imitating Teena] "My pelt is soaked!
Aah!"
[groaning] [imitating Munk] "Heh, you have pretty...
[spits] eyes."
[Ugga] Then she buried Munk's legs under a crazy heavy boulder.
Now Grug has to carry him everywhere he wants to go.
Teena's still at large.
I knew there was a reason why I excluded her.
[excited chatter]
Now that's some good dirt, Ugga.
Here, let me get this for you.
No, let me nitpick.
I call dibs on her lice.
Guys, guys, my scalp is crawling with enough bugs to go around.
Grug, honey.
How was your day?
Full of juicy, embarrassing new stories, I'm hoping.
I'm, uh, guessing.
Well, this valley's problems are overwhelming, even for a truly, truly great leader like me.
Aw, why don't you tell me all about them, so I can, uh, help... you.
[Thunk] That is so thoughtful of you, Mom.
- [buzzing] - [grunting, sighing]
Yep, I got only good intentions.
Now start dishing.
Okay, well, first, there's Baitsy.
Apparently, he wanted rock-hard abs, so guess what he did.
[Ugga] And then he was, like... [as Baitsy] "You have to suffer to be beautiful."
That is the funniest thing I'll ever hear in my life.
Unless you've got something better?
Oh, I am just getting started.
I heard Marm snuck off Old People Island.
[Ugga] Marm was all, like, [imitating Marm] "See, I'm still young.
Don't abandon me with those geezers.
[lizvult screeching]
Come on, man, be cool.
Take him!"
[imitating Womp] "I'm Womp."
[laughter]
Wait.
I've got an even better one.
You know Bud and Crud, those guys totally obsessed with eggs?
Well, Crud comes home to discover his brother likes eggs a little too much.
[imitating Bud] "I'm an ooey-gooey goopy eggie!
Ahh!
Don't come in!"
[Ugga] Crud and Grug had to confront Bud about his issues, but he freaked out and hid in a lizvult's nest.
[imitating Womp] "I'm Womp."
[laughter]
You're the queen of telling stories about people behind their backs.
You make your mother proud.
So what else have you got?
Oh, wait till you hear about Baitsy and his rock-hard abs.
Heard it.
Next.
Oh.
Hey, why doesn't somebody else go?
Gran?
Oh, I'm not about to follow that.
You got more stories or not?
[nervous laughing]
Grug, honey!
How was your... [gasps] What happened?
[sigh] Old Man Root happened.
I went to help him with his rash, but he was not happy to see me.
[Grug] He was all, like, [imitating root] "Grug, you're a great leader.
Some might say the best leader.
But why did you tell everyone about my rash?"
Then I was, like, "What do you mean?"
No, wait, I said it more like this, [calmly] "What do you mean?"
[pained groan]
Oh, that is awful.
So, um, how did his rash look, exactly?
Ugga, the only person I told about Root was you.
What exactly have you been doing at "nitting" club?
Nothing.
I just, ya know, go sip some smash fruit.
Oh, is that what you're calling it?
"Go-sip"?
Ugga, you can't share secrets about other people like that.
Okay, I'll stop.
And I'm sorry if what I said got you hurt.
Uh, unrelated, you got any problems you wanna talk about?
- The funnier the better.
- [growls]
[Thunk] You could share secrets about me.
Huh.
A goofy kid with a nest on his head.
[imitating Thunk] "I can do the voice."
Nah.
That's not gonna cut it.
Please.
I like it when people talk about me. [grunting] [sighs] There's gotta be good dirt to share around here somewhere.
Oh, but all I see are rocks, and not even rocks with secrets.
[groaning] [sighs] Want sit with Amber?
Sunset start soon.
Perfect time to... cry and get all emotion out of nose.
In form of snot.
[crying]
Come on.
It be our little secret.
Secret...
Uh, sorry.
Uh, "nitting" club's waiting for me.
- I gotta go, bye.
- [sobbing]
There she is.
Give us some dirt, Ugga, and make it juicy.
Basically, we want mud.
Ooh, I got some muddy mud for you!
You all know Amber, right?
- [Amber crying]
- Well, I just saw her, and she said, [imitating Amber] "Amber act all tough, but Amber always cry watching sunset like big baby.
Wah.
Amber have big, drippy boogers.
Wah."
- Oh, that is rich.
- Oh!
Sad little Amber.
And what kind of person has boogers?
- A very mad one.
- [all gasping]
Amber trust Ugga.
[gasps] Is she gonna cry?
Amber no cry.
Amber make Ugga cry.
[screams]
[panting]
[screaming]
Did you hear about Thunk?
Apparently, he ate a whole rainbow.
Oh, he... he sure is fun to talk about, Thunk.
I stand by what he...
what he said.
[angry growl]
Amber, I'm sorry.
I only told them about you because otherwise,
I have nothing interesting to say.
Nobody cares that I organize my pelts by color or that I vomit at the sight of vomit, or that I have morning breath that could kill a mosquitoad.
[growling]
Aw, actually, Amber relate to Ugga desire to fit in.
And killer bad breath pretty awesome, not boring.
Amber like knowing things about Ugga.
So do I. You vomit at the sight of vomit.
I thought only I did that.
And pelts should be organized by color.
Browns go with browns, it just makes sense.
Yes.
I found a torn pelt and am pretty sure it means one of the kids I babysit was eaten by a bear owl.
Uh, I mean, let's just watch the sunset.
- [all sobbing]
- It's beautiful!
I say... it's nice to finally be ourselves, or rather, our shells.
I'll see myself out.

[Shiro] Okay, look.
I now know for certain that Zarkon is tracking us through the Black Lion.
We have to find some way to stop him.
How are we gonna do that?
We've never had this situation before.
Two paladins battling for the same lion.
Well, unless we want Zarkon taking control of Voltron every time we get close...
I'll have to forge a new bond with my lion.
One that's stronger than his.
Well, while you're working on that... the rest of us need to find some new teludav lenses... otherwise we won't be able to travel via wormhole.
-Is that something we have to mail order?
-Does anyone even make those anymore?
[Allura] I don't know.
Only a few Alteans could use the teludav 10,000 ago.
They may not exist anymore.
I think I may know where we can get some.
Coran!
You're not suggesting going to one of those filthy swap moons!
The last time you went, those space pirates took you for everything you had.
Space pirates?
The Unilu were traders and pirates... that roamed the galaxies and dealt in black market goods.
Umvy spice, by-tor water, little bottles of infinity vapor.
Of course, you had to bargain.
No one could bargain like the Unilu.
Last time, I ended up giving away three quarters of my shipment of lango... in exchange for a used pogo oscillator.
[chuckling]
Father was not pleased about that.
Well, while Coran is picking up his lenses...
I'll take you shopping for something sparkly.
This isn't shopping!
You're not wandering around saying...
"What a lovely pink hat!
This is so becoming."
No!
I can't allow Allura to get anywhere near those... filthy, lowballing Unilu hoodlums.
But I'd love something sparkly.
Look, you're the only one who can operate the Castle.
You need to be resting, after all you've been through.
Now, let's ready a pod for our mission.
We need to get in... find the scaultrite lenses, and just get out.
Shotgun!
What?
No, you have to be in the pod bay to call shotgun.
Since when?
[Hunk] Since forever?
That's shotgun etiquette!
I wrote the book.
While they're doing that, I'm going to head down to the hangar.
I need to strengthen my bond with the Black Lion.
[sighing]
So what am I supposed to do now, sit around and worry all day?
[mice squeaking]
What?
Dinner and a show?
You and I have some work to do.
[exhaling]
Work with me.
What do I have to do to strengthen our bond?
[gasping]
[Shiro] Whoa!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Stop!
I said stop!
Turn around.
That's an order!
[Coran] Hello?
Back passengers?
Can you hear me?
[Lance] Oh, it's so comfy up here.
Extra leg-room, heated seats!
Oh, man!
Stupid Lance.
Stupid shotgun.
Now, these swap moons are very dangerous environments.
So be on your toes.
No weapons or communication devices of any kind!
Also, I've brought along some disguises.
Coran?
This Unilu swap meet looks an awful lot like a regular mall.
It does seem to be a little cleaner than I remember.
Still, be vigilant.
The Unilu are cut-throat wheeler-dealers.
So keep your hands on your coin satchels.
My satchels are empty.
Good.
Let's just get this over with.
Yes, right.
Everyone, let's fan out, search the area for teludav lenses.
We'll meet by the giant ticking clock here in one vaga.
Don't be late, and try to blend in.
[screen beeping]
What the...
Space pirates!
Disguising yourselves as harmless shoppers, huh?
Well, it won't work.
Don't worry, Emperor Zarkon.
I know you can't be here to protect the mall... but your faithful number two is on the case.
Hope you pirates are ready to face Varkon.
[Shiro groaning] Come on!
[groaning]
I don't know where you're headed... but you need to start listening to me right now!
That's better.
Where are we?
Why did you bring me here?
What are you trying to tell me?
[gasping]
So you want me to see through your eyes.
[gasping]
Was this your home?
Okay, if I were a 10,000-year-old wormhole lens, where would I be?
Excuse me, hey, hi, excuse me, hi!
Wow, you guys are really booking here.
So I was just wondering if you guys knew where I could find... some lenses for my ship around here?
Is there a one-hour lens place around here or something?
Anything?
Nothing?
Never mind, you know what?
I'll catch up with you guys later!
[panting]
Oh!
This is beautiful!
[chuckling]
Maybe the scaultrite is under these samples.
I don't know.
Rubbery.
Sweet and salty.
So cold, but spicy.
Mmm, eh...
What's next, what do you got?
[Vrepit Sal] Five hundred GAC.
Five hundred GAC.
Excuse me?
Sustenance provided by Vrepit Sal, that's me.
Five hundred GAC is now owed.
I thought this was a "free sample" situation.
Free?
Of charge.
You know, gratis?
Look, I don't have any money.
So, you know...
Oh, man!
How long you been here?
Sal put me in when I was just a little girl.
Oh, no!
Let me show you this wonderful workings of the Galasu X-90 Extreme Blade System.
It slices, it dices, it kills, slaughters, and skins... and constantly stays razor sharp!
Look at it cut through this bloato fruit.
Paper thin.
How much would you pay for this knife?
But wait, there's more!
How many times have you had to fight off a charging rock monster... and then go immediately to a picnic?
All the time, right?
The Galasu can cut through rocks and still cut bloato fruit paper thin.
Now how much would you pay?
Seriously, how much?
I have a lot of these to unload.
I just had a question.
Fine!
What do you got?
Have you ever come across something like this?
Whoa, this craftsmanship is incredible!
And is this a luxite blade?
The planet they mine that from hasn't existed in decafebes.
Where'd you get this?
Someone gave it to me.
Okay, that's vague.
Tell you what...
I'll give you 1,000 GAC to take it off your hands.
It's not for sale.
Two thousand.
No, thanks.
Give it back.
How about this?
I keep the knife and you beat it before security gets here.
I know it's stolen.
It's not stolen.
Then tell me where you got it.
[groaning] [grunting]
Hey!
Come back with that!
[button beeping] [imitating motorcycle revving]
Trouble at the Slice Capades?
It's one of those pirates!
I knew they looked edgy.
Varkon's comin' for ya!
[hoverbike whirring]
[Shiro] So this was Zarkon's home planet.
Show me more.
[Shiro] King Alford built you from that comet.
And you fought beside him.
With Zarkon.
[gasping]
You!
[mice squeaking]
[giggling]
Absolutely stunning!
After we defeat Zarkon, I'm taking you on the road!
[mice squeaking]
[toilet flushing]
I'll just hold it.
[giggling]
Can I interest you in the latest Earth fashions?
Lance, come on!
We have to be back at the ticking clock in a half hour.
But Pidge, wait, look at all this crazy Earth stuff this alien is selling!
We're supposed to be looking for the teludav lenses... and you're looking in the one store we know for certain won't have--
Oh, my gosh!
Is that Killbot Phantasm 1?
The first journey to the depths of the demon sphere?
Oh!
Mercury Gameflux Two!
With the original power glove that gives you infinite lives if you touch the index finger to the pinky!
We have to have this!
How much is this?
Twelve hundred GAC.
Is that a lot?
Well, compared to what we have, which is none, yes.
It's a lot.
We're gonna find some money.
Come on!
Don't sell that!
Don't worry.
I never sell anything.
Do I, Kaltenecker?
[Kaltenecker mooing]
Ah, one of the Unilu.
[whistling]
Like, can I help you?
Yes.
Can you tell me where the "other" market is?
The what?
Well, some might call it the "black market."
I don't think I know that.
Maybe check there.
I don't think this would be "on" the map.
It might be more "off-book."
Hm?
Maybe this will help you remember?
Again, what?
Ah, the old Unilu shakedown, eh?
[chuckling] Fine.
Starting to get a fuzzy recollection yet?
Who is this?
-Is this you?
-No!
That's King Groggery the Infirm!
You know what?
I'll find it myself!
[groaning] I'm so out of this dump.
I gotta escape somehow.
Maybe I can scrub through these cuffs.
[horn blows]
Forty-three!
Sustenance unit complete.
-Ingest.
-[moaning]
-[explosion]
-Huh?
[robot buzzing]
Oh, not again!
Now who will be my sustenance preparer?
I got this, Sal.
Un-cuff me.
[chuckling] You?
Trust me.
I'm an enthusiastic gourmand with an incredible palate.
Also, your robot is dead on the floor.
That last part is true.
All right, work.
Okay, now watch this!
I can't read this.
Doesn't matter.
I'll just improvise.
Do you smell how the tanginess of tuber masture really brings out... the charred flavor from the palmagoren fillet?
No, no, we won't be using that.
Let's just say, "Number 44?
Your order's up."
Enjoy your meal.
[moaning]
What did you do to her face?
It's cracking!
She's smiling!
She's enjoying her food.
Okay, let's provide some sustenance!
Show me more.
Those wings...
You have powers I haven't unlocked.
Incredible!
I've got you now, paladin.
[screaming]
You are a fool to face me here.
When you die in this realm, your body dies as well.
And then I will take control of Voltron.
[grunting]
[yelling] [groaning]
[grunting]
[breathing heavily]
I'll find you pirates!
[hoverbike beeping]
What's going on here?
Official business, excuse me, this is a fire hazard.
I'm in the middle of a hot pursuit.
I said "over medium".
Over medium, you rube!
Does this look over medium to you?
No, Chef.
Then let's get it right, huh?
If it ain't perfect, it ain't coming out of this kitchen, people!
Sauce me!
Now you're getting it!
-Bon appétit.
-[applause]
I got you now, pirate!
Where are your friends?
[screaming]
Don't forget what I taught you!
Those are the fundamentals of cooking!
That kid is a genius.
I don't care if we have to search the entire galaxy!
I want him back at Vrepit Sal's!
[Shiro panting]
You could never take my place as the head of Voltron.
-[yelling] -[grunting]
You can't pilot the Black Lion after everything you've done!
You can never lead Voltron again!
You're no paladin!
[groaning]
You have no idea how to command a weapon like this!
No one commands the Black Lion!
[grunting]
You dare lecture me?
[gasping]
Do you think the Black Lion would allow such a feeble creature to pilot it?
Only the powerful can command it.
You've forgotten what's most important between a lion and its paladin.
It's not about power.
It's about earning each other's trust.
Trust has nothing to do with it.
The lion is mine, forever.
[screaming]
Huh?
[yelling]
No!
Sire, what is it?
My connection grows weaker.
We must hurry if we ever wish to reclaim Voltron!
Did you just save me?
Thank you.
Let's go home.
[gasping]
We never left.
Oh, this tenner looks like the last one.
So how much have we got?
Eleven hundred and ninety-six GAC.
We're so close!
Lance, look!
Already on it!
Yeah!
Let's go!
[laughing]
Thanks!
Gotta hide!
Gotta hide!
[toilet flushing]
Keith!
He's right behind me!
Who?
[hoverbike beeping]
Pirate number two!
My lucky day!
[yelping]
Hold on.
With every purchase, you get a free Kaltenecker.
Time to get moving, guys!
Security's on our tail!
There's the rest of the crew!
[yelping] [panting]
Everyone up on Kaltenecker!
Did you buy a cow?
It was free with purchase!
[everyone screaming]
Hold on a tick, this looks familiar!
Oh, lookie-lookie.
An original Unilu swap shop!
[sighing]
Good eye, friend.
This shop's been in my family since before the empire began.
Can I interest you in a butcher barrel?
Or perhaps a set of window breakers?
Teludav lenses!
Yes!
I mean, I don't have any idea what these pieces of junk are.
I see you've got your eye on these antique glass table toppers here.
Well, they're pretty ugly.
But I do have an empty curio cabinet for grotesqueries.
How much do you want?
How much have you got?
Oh, I have a handful of pocket lint.
I'll take your first-born child.
I might be able to throw in a used handkerchief.
-I could accept your left foot.
-I'd be willing to sing you a song!
You become my butler for one year.
-Two Altean crown bills.
-Five Valuvium ingots.
Oh, would you accept an IOU?
Of course.
I'll just need some collateral.
Maybe ten Valuvium ingots!
Or how about this?
One Olkari flying cube.
-You've got a deal!
-[giggling]
-There he is!
-We gotta go, Coran!
[panting]
I got the scaultrite lenses!
Scaultrite?
Hold on a tick!
No take-backs!
Get back here!
[screaming]
Doggone it!
You better run!
Don't let me catch you in my jurisdiction again, pirates!
Oh, so you can't follow us outside, huh?
[taunting, yelping] [grunting]
That's one for Varkon.
We got our lenses!
Excellent!
Now, we can get the teludav up and running.
Where's Shiro?
What did you do?
Take a nap?
Not exactly.
Is that a cow?
Mm-hmm, his name is Kaltenecker.
[mooing]
So, did you find a way to bond with your lion?
Yes, and we need to get moving.
We're headed for the Blade of Marmora's headquarters.
I'll plot a course.
While you're doing that, I'm gonna hook up the video game Lance and I bought.
Yeah!
Let's get this baby set up.
Where can we...
How do...
[Pidge] No!
I'm sorry, viewer.

I want you to always remember... ‐You are special.

Mom, can I watch one more?
I don't know, Sue.
Did you do your homework?
Not yet, I will after one more episode.
Please!
I'm almost done, I just need, like, one more day.
This is your final paper.
You had the whole semester.
‐I know, but‐‐ ‐I swear, every year
I get one kid with so much potential, they got their act together, they could change the world.
Paper's due at midnight.
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
‐Hi, Mom.
‐Good news, sweetie.
Grandma's flying out for graduation!
That is so great.
We're so proud of you, honey.
Our little Einstein ready to take on the world.
So, factoring in the speed of light and the curvature of the Earth, and adjusting for intermorphic theory of space‐time, you have eight hours to write the whole term paper.
Good, great.
You would've had nine if you'd just taken the clock's word for it, but whatever.
Just start with your name.
And...
And here we go.
‐ ‐One second.
I'm sure you can't relate to the struggles of Susan Hirsch.
After all, you work hard.
You value your time.
You'd never waste your whole night watching a science fiction TV show.
And the dissimilarities don't stop there.
For Susan Hirsch is about to discover a secret so shocking that‐‐well, you'll find out.
All in good... time.
Ta‐da.
You've already finished it?
Well, pending the Sue Hirsch seal of approval, of course.
"Exploring Quantum Paradoxes" by Alex Kapur.
‐lt's cute.
‐Thanks!
So, when do I get to see yours?
See my what?
Um, your paper.
What'd you end up writing about?
Oh, you know, sciency physics stuff.
Oh, my God, you haven't started yet.
I've started thinking about it.
It's due at midnight!
But, you know, by the time he actually gets around to reading, it'll be like 12:30, so‐‐
‐Sue, if you don't finish‐‐ ‐I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Tell you what... if someone from the future invents
‐time travel‐‐ ‐Mm‐hmm.
‐‐I will go back in time and place my paper right here.
You know in order for that to actually work, you have to write the paper first, right?
You know you've got the wrong equation for closed timeline curves, right?
Shut up, don't change the subject, okay?
'Cause this is about‐‐ what did you just say?
That's Deutsch's model.
What you want is Lloyd's.
Like the "who" versus "whom" of timeline equations.
Oh, my God.
Why did I take theoretical physics?
Okay, maybe this will help.
Remember that episode of Time Ryder where they're stuck in ancient Rome?
Season two, "Time, Time Again."
Season two of what now?
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens."
What is that, like a cartoon or something?
You don't remember "Time Ryder" from the '90s?
Sundial Cartoons?
Must be drawing a blank.
I get it, someone's zapped the memo eraser around you, very funny.
Huh?
Time Ryder uses the memo eraser to erase people's memories...
You know what, we are watching an episode right now.
What about the paper?
Just one episode, I promise.
It'll be a night you remember for the rest of your life.
Oh, boy.
Okay, so it's like Wishbone meets Captain Planet but way cooler than‐‐
Huh.
What is that smell?
I don't‐‐ I don't know, maybe you're having a stroke.
So, anyway, Time Ryder is captain of the Crono Squad.
They defend Earth's timeline, so every week he and the Crono Teens...
Must've taken it down again.
Wait...
What?
No, that's impossible.
Well, maybe you spelled it wrong.
That's also impossible.
I was just watching an episode and then you rang, and I stepped on a...
Oh, my God.
Any luck down there, Alex?
Not yet.
Uh, hey, don't you have like a friend from high school you could ask?
Friend from high school, that's a good one.
Come on, you don't have one friend that you grew up with?
Of course.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom!
Silly question, but you remember "Time Ryder," right?
Sorry, Time what now?
Time Ryder.
Is that a cartoon or something?
Are you kidding?
I watched the cartoons every day after school.
You bought me the toys every Hanukkah.
Well, put some on your list this year, and we'll see what Jewish Santa can do.
She doesn't remember it either.
It's like the show never even existed.
Alex, do you think I'm crazy?
Um...
Maybe you're just having, like, a panic attack.
Sue, please don't do this.
No time to argue, it's a four‐hour bike ride to Sundial Cartoons.
They'll have scripts, they'll have sound,
‐they'll have‐‐ ‐They'll be closed, Sue.
Then I'll peak through the window.
Even if you're right, you're throwing your future away for a cartoon.
It's not real, Sue.
Time Ryder is not real.
History needs your help.
Time Ryder!
I come from the future.
No, a future.
A future where mankind has reached its full potential.
A future in peril because there's something that happens here tonight.
Something that changes the course of history.
I have traveled to this locus of space and time on a desperate mission to stop it.
So I ask you... in the name of the future of humankind have you kids seen any weird shit going on tonight?
Okay, uh, one second, guy.
Sue, we gotta call the cops.
This dude is nuts.
No, he's not, he's Time Ryder.
Haven't you been listening?
He's in a turquoise motorcycle outfit.
Listen, there can't be a Time Ryder.
You said it yourself, Time Ryder's a cartoon.
Yeah, and he's sitting right in front of us.
Oh, well, that's the coolest shit I've ever seen in my life.
Please continue.
You're right, smart guy.
Time Ryder is a cartoon.
One that inspires an entire generation of young minds to pursue science, including the inventor of time travel.
I told you it was a really good show.
Well, we try.
Wait a second, that's it.
Somehow the entire show is disappearing from existence.
No one remembers it, even my toys have disappeared.
My God.
That show is the most important piece of children's entertainment in the universe.
It's the foundation on which my future was built.
And if it disappears...
My future's history.
Whoa.
We need to go back.
To the moment this all began.
And we need to find out who... or what is erasing that show and stop it.
But I'll need your help.
Are you with me, Crono Teens?
I'm 23.
Then raise your right hand.
Okay.
Do you vow to preserve the past?
‐We vow.
‐Uh, yes.
Do you swear to defend the future?
‐We swear.
‐I swear.
Do you have any homework due tomorrow?
Mmm, give me one second.
Sue, you've gotta finish your paper.
Um, he has a time machine, duh.
‐We're good.
‐Mm‐hmm.
In that case...
Crono Teens unite.
‐lt goes on top.
‐Yeah, that was self explanatory, sorry.
Are you ready to ride the timeline, kids?
Yeah!
Let's ride.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
Oh, yes.
Is it over?
Mm, this never gets old.
One second.
Okay.
These Invisibracelets are linked to the ROYGBIV scrambalizer on my Crono Gauntlet.
As long as you wear them, no one from the past can see you or hear you.
This is so cool.
Okay, Alex, here we go.
Ta‐da!
No, no, that's too much crotch.
Uh...
Ta‐da!
Why, why Jazz hands?
What am I doing?
All right, uh...
Ta‐dow!
Yeah.
You got a fast‐forward button on that thing?
Oh, I am rank.
Ta‐da!
You've already finished it.
Let's just, uh...
let's keep moving.
You know, by the time he actually gets around to reading it, it'll be like 12:30, so‐‐
Sue, if you don't finish it‐‐
I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Okay, tell you what, if someone from the future invents time travel...
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Look, my toys.
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet.
This isn't the past, it's the past of your past.
Could this be any more confusing?
It's our past before our timeline's changed.
Does that mean...
Okay, you remember that episode of "Time Ryder"
where they get stuck in ancient Rome?
Really, another Time Ryder story?
Okay, let's go down this rabbit hole again.
You remember the show.
I don't remember remembering the show.
‐Season two‐‐ ‐lt's like you really did get hit with a memo eraser.
That's impossible.
The only memo eraser on active service is right...
Looking for this?
Entropy.
I've waited a long time for this.
But in some ways it's been no time at all.
Prepare yourself Time Ryder.
It looks like time is about to ride you!
Hey, asshole.
‐Huh?
‐
Oh!
Okay, first of all, I knew I wasn't the stinky one.
And second of all, who or what the hell was that?
Remember when I told you I come from a future that's great?
‐No.
‐Well, I did.
Anyway, Entropy comes from a future that sucks.
Of course!
Entropy's the one trying to erase our show.
With my memories, damn.
We played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Entropy could attack anywhere at any time.
There he is.
Oh, I am rank.
Damn.
Why us, why now?
We'll ask him when we catch him.
Got a fast‐forward button on that thing?
Let's keep moving.
Why‐‐why would he do that?
Let's move.
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Oh, there.
My toys...
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet, this isn't your past, it's the past of your past.
Can this be any more confusing?
Sure can, buddy.
Entropy should reappear to steal my memo eraser
‐in T minus‐‐ ‐Oh, there he is.
He stole the memo thing.
Damn!
Tracking his signature.
He's coming back around.
The only memo eraser in active service is right...
Looking for this?
Got him.
Hey, asshole.
Oh!
Damn, we played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride!
Okay, and what the hell was that?
Maybe we won.
Maybe Time Ryder got the cuffs on him and he's hauling him off to Time Base One.
Ryder!
What is that smell?
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, my God, is he dead?
He's alive.
Okay, so what‐‐ what do we do?
'Cause, I mean, has anything like this ever happened on the show?
Actually, in episode 304‐‐
Of course.
Oh no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Relax, I've seen this done a million times on the show, it's just... ‐Oh, oops.
‐Oops?
Just let me close out of this.
All right.
Oh!
‐ ‐One second.
‐I got it!
‐Wait, wait, you should probably stay on the bed with me.
It's safer.
Ta‐da!
Oh, no, too much crotch.
Uh, ta‐da‐‐no.
It's jazz hands.
All right.
Ta‐dow.
Ta‐dow!
Oh!
I am rank.
Uh, what?
‐Looking for this?
‐No!
Ta‐da!
Huh?
Oh!
Entropy, you're under arrest for causality violations in Continuum Sector 818.
Nice moves, Crono Teens.
Thanks for leaving that note.
Wait, we didn't leave a note.
Huh.
Guess I left it for myself.
Not a bad move.
You know, it's against regulations to take a Crono Captain's memo eraser without his consent.
I know, but it was the only way to make sure the Entropy didn't completely erase everything.
It looks like it worked.
Hey...
I think I remember the TV show.
Including that shitty Christmas special you did.
Huh.
Everyone's a critic, aren't they?
Well, it seems as though the timeline is back on course, and this case is history.
That's it?
Crono Squad thanks you for your service.
No, no, that‐‐ that can't be it.
I mean, what was he doing here?
Why did he coming after us?
I have so many questions.
Of course you do.
You're a scientist, Sue.
But your place is in here now.
Entropy's secrets belong to the future.
Will I ever‐‐ will we ever see you again?
Only time will tell.
Jesus.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take this... scum back to Time Base One.
Au revoir, Crono Teens.
Let's ride.
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes.
Au revoir.
Ugh.
Well, that was... an interesting way to spend an evening.
Oof.
Uh, so... back to work?
How can you say that?
What?
We just traveled through time.
We were Crono Teens.
We can't just pretend like that didn't happen.
Ryder was right, this is where we belong.
I can't go back to the way things were.
Back‐‐this is the back, Sue.
We are back, and you got a lot of work to do.
You're right.
What are you look‐‐
We do.
Is it happening‐‐oh.
It's Entropy's ring.
The source of all his power.
Great, I‐‐I wonder what it's doing here.
I don't know, but as Crono Teens, it's our duty to pass it off to the right authorities.
Are you kid‐‐
Of course it is.
We should give it back to Time Base One.
It'll be safe there.
I mean, what if it got into the wrong hands?
It already is in the wrong hands.
Don't you wanna see Time Base One?
It's one of the seven wonders of the galaxy, and to set this right?
No!
I don't.
So, if you wanna play time teen, by all means, but‐‐but you're on your own, okay?
Fine, suit yourself.
No, that's the wrong answer.
Sue, Sue, you sit down on this bed, Sue‐‐Sue!
‐Time Base One!
‐No!
Oh, hey.
Those were on your‐‐
Uh, where are we?
I thought Time Base One was in the future.
I thought so too.
Judging by the freshness of that guy's kicks,
I'd say we were in 1995.
We're in the '90s.
Of course.
Ahem!
Hi.
We're here to see Time Ryder.
Did you have an appointment?
No, but we came to give him this.
What did you say your name was?
Susan Hirsch.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, well, come on in, Miss Hirsch.
Yeah, please.
I'll get this to Captain Ryder right away.
What is going on?
Don't you see, Alex?
Time Base One is Sundial Cartoons.
That's why the show looks just like the future because the show is made by people from the future.
So, this guy right here is from the future?
They all are.
Think about it.
Crono Squad's entire mission is to protect humanity's future, and what better way to do that than by inspiring the children of the past.
Is that who I think it is?
I don't know.
Listen, we saw this place.
Can we please leave?
Hey, future guy.
Nice corduroys.
Yeah.
Mr. Nash?
Uh‐huh?
I‐‐I'm a really big fan of your show.
I actually saw you a while back at CronoCon.
Well, I guess 20 years from now, but um...
I'm rambling.
Can I get you to sign something for me?
‐Name?
‐Susan Hirsch.
Susan Hirsch?
Wally.
Wally Nash.
It's an honor to meet you, young lady.
It is?
Well, of course it is.
You'll have to excuse us if we're all a little star struck.
It's not every day we meet the Mother of Time.
Yeah, that's me.
Mother of Time.
Come on, guys.
Miss Hirsch has some urgent business with Captain Ryder.
Guys, come on.
Okay, what's the problem?
We've been trying to send Lord Snappington here back to Time Jail, but we can't get a signature lock.
Have you compensated for signal interference?
That's just it, the channel's clear, but we can only read Time Jail for a few seconds at a time, almost as if it's‐‐
It's flickering out of existence.
Is that you, Time Ryder?
I know you can hear me.
What have you done?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is Deutsch's model, you want Lloyd's model.
You ever see "Time, Time Again"?
Uh...
Yeah, this whole thing is a mess.
Thanks.
When's it due again?
Midnight.
Thank God for time travel.
Right.
Wait, what?
What?
I'm whating your what.
So clarify your what.
You still have enough time to do your paper, right?
Yes, I have a time machine.
Uh‐oh.
Um...
Okay, do you know how time travel works?
Do you know how time‐‐'cause I'm...
I have no idea.
You know what the best part of an eternity in Time Jail was?
I had eternity to think up the perfect plan.
Even though you are in the past right now, your present continues to move forward without you.
Okay.
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
Sorry, I gotta get out of here.
As we learned with the Logan‐Prescott Theory‐‐
I know this, any object traveling through time must return to its own present.
‐Yes.
‐Mm‐hmm.
So even though you are in 1996 right now, and it's 2:45pm.
That means in my own present time it's...
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I‐‐I have to go.
Sue, Sue.
Logan‐Prescott Theorem.
Don't freak out, but our present is happening
‐without us.
‐I know.
You know?
‐You lied to me?
‐I'm sorry.
I just had to see this place.
It was a mistake, it was a big, big mistake.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Oh no, the paper.
Timeline breach detected.
Entropy, you scum.
Save your anger for the Mother of Time.
She lied to you, Time Ryder.
What are you talking about?
Her homework?
No, she took an oath.
I must've come up with a million ways to exact my revenge.
This one wasn't the best, but it was the most ironic.
It seems you don't need an army or a doomsday weapon to destroy the future, all you need is to give Susan Hirsch what she always wanted... a chance to star in a real‐life
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens" adventure.
You're forgetting one thing, smart guy.
You're in here.
Who's gonna get you out of that?
Isn't it obvious?
I am.
Hey, Captain.
Susan Hirsch is here.
What, how?
She came to bring you this.
Thank you.
Greetings from the future, Time Ryder.
No!
Thank you.
Damn.
Susan, how could you do this?
I've let you down, I'm sorry.
What's happening?
She didn't do her paper.
She's gonna flunk out of school.
But if she flunks out of school, she won't get into grad school.
She doesn't go to grad school, she'll never invent time travel.
She doesn't invent time travel, the future will never exist, and neither will we.
Okay, let's just all calm down.
Oh, my God, we're all gonna die!
Well, we're still here, which means we still have a chance.
My paper's due at midnight.
It's 11:30, and I haven't even started.
You haven't even started?
Well, I started thinking about it.
But... every time I go to write this stupid paper, it's‐‐ it's hard, and I'm worried I'm gonna be a big failure and let everyone down, so I...
I put it off, and I watch cartoons.
I am not the Mother of Time.
I will never be her.
I'm a failure.
‐No.
‐You're not a failure yet.
Look, the paper's due on his desk at midnight, but he's probably not gonna get to it till 12:30.
So what?
So, if we can stall him, if we can get him out of that office, we can buy Sue time to finish her paper.
Did I get that right?
Is that how time travel works?
'Cause I'm just a plus one here.
Sue's less‐important friend is right.
Yeah‐‐all right.
We can buy you the time.
Can you get the job done?
Of course she can.
She's a Crono Teen.
Yeah, I can do it.
Hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Term paper.

"Paradox detected," what the hell is it talking about?
It's talking about me.
Episode 23.
The problem with paradoxes, in about 30 seconds I'll be a girl who remembers a show that never existed, which makes me a living, breathing paradox.
And you can't return to the present until the paradox is resolved.
How do I resolve it?
No.
No, no, that is not an option.
It's your only option.
Then I'll find another one!
Sue, you can stay in the past forever or let me go and face the future on your own.
I can't, I mean, look at me, I'm a mess.

I know, but I swear, every year
I get one kid with so much potential, they got their act together, they could change the world.
Paper's due at midnight.
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
Hi, Mom. Good news, sweetie.
Grandma's flying out for graduation!
That is so great.
We're so proud of you, honey.
Our little Einstein ready to take on the world.
So, factoring in the speed of light and the curvature of the Earth, and adjusting for intermorphic theory of spacetime, you have eight hours to write the whole term paper.
Good, great.
You would've had nine if you'd just taken the clock's word for it, but whatever.
Just start with your name.
And...
And here we go.
 One second.
I'm sure you can't relate to the struggles of Susan Hirsch.
After all, you work hard.
You value your time.
You'd never waste your whole night watching a science fiction TV show.
And the dissimilarities don't stop there.
For Susan Hirsch is about to discover a secret so shocking thatwell, you'll find out.
All in good... time.
Tada.
You've already finished it?
Well, pending the Sue Hirsch seal of approval, of course.
"Exploring Quantum Paradoxes" by Alex Kapur.
lt's cute. Thanks!
So, when do I get to see yours?
See my what?
Um, your paper.
What'd you end up writing about?
You know, sciency physics stuff.
My God, you haven't started yet.
I've started thinking about it.
It's due at midnight!
But, you know, by the time he actually gets around to reading, it'll be like 12:30, so
Sue, if you don't finish I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Tell you what... if someone from the future invents
time travel 
I will go back in time and place my paper right... here.
You know in order for that to actually work, you have to write the paper first, right?
You know you've got the wrong equation for closed timeline curves, right?
Shut up, don't change the subject, okay?
'Cause this is about what did you just say?
That's Deutsch's model.
What you want is Lloyd's.
Like the "who" versus "whom" of timeline equations.
My God.
Why did I take theoretical physics?
Okay, maybe this will help.
Remember that episode of Time Ryder where they're stuck in ancient Rome?
Season two, "Time, Time Again."
Season two of what now?
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens."
What is that, like a cartoon or something?
You don't remember "Time Ryder" from the '90s?
Sundial Cartoons?
Must be drawing a blank.
I get it, someone's zapped the memo eraser around you, very funny.
Time Ryder uses the memo eraser to erase people's memories...
You know what, we are watching an episode right now.
What about the paper?
Just one episode, I promise.
It'll be a night you remember for the rest of your life.
Boy.
Okay, so it's like Wishbone meets Captain Planet but way cooler than.
What is that smell?
I don't I don't know, maybe you're having a stroke.
So, anyway, Time Ryder is captain of the Crono Squad.
They defend Earth's timeline, so every week he and the Crono Teens...
Must've taken it down again.
Wait...
What?
No, that's impossible.
Well, maybe you spelled it wrong.
That's also impossible.
I was just watching an episode and then you rang, and I stepped on a...
My God.
Any luck down there, Alex?
Not yet.
Hey, don't you have like a friend from high school you could ask?
Friend from high school, that's a good one.
Come on, you don't have one friend that you grew up with?
Of course.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom!
Silly question, but you remember "Time Ryder," right?
Sorry, Time what now?
Time Ryder.
Is that a cartoon or something?
Are you kidding?
I watched the cartoons every day after school.
You bought me the toys every Hanukkah.
Well, put some on your list this year, and we'll see what Jewish Santa can do.
She doesn't remember it either.
It's like the show never even existed.
Alex, do you think I'm crazy?
Um...
Maybe you're just having, like, a panic attack.
Sue, please don't do this.
No time to argue, it's a fourhour bike ride to Sundial Cartoons.
They'll have scripts, they'll have sound,
they'll have They'll be closed, Sue.
Then I'll peak through the window.
Even if you're right, you're throwing your future away for a cartoon.
It's not real, Sue.
Time Ryder is not real.
History needs your help.
Time Ryder!
I come from the future.
No, a future.
A future where mankind has reached its full potential.
A future in peril because there's something that happens here tonight.
Something that changes the course of history.
I have traveled to this locus of space and time on a desperate mission to stop it.
So I ask you... in the name of the future of humankind... have you kids seen any weird shit going on tonight?
Okay, one second, guy.
Sue, we gotta call the cops.
This dude is nuts.
No, he's not, he's Time Ryder.
Haven't you been listening?
He's in a turquoise motorcycle outfit.
Listen, there can't be a Time Ryder.
You said it yourself, Time Ryder's a cartoon.
Yeah, and he's sitting right in front of us.
Well, that's the coolest shit I've ever seen in my life.
Please continue.
You're right, smart guy.
Time Ryder is a cartoon.
One that inspires an entire generation of young minds to pursue science, including the inventor of time travel.
I told you it was a really good show.
Well, we try.
Wait a second, that's it.
Somehow the entire show is disappearing from existence.
No one remembers it, even my toys have disappeared.
My God.
That show is the most important piece of children's entertainment in the universe.
It's the foundation on which my future was built.
And if it disappears...
My future's history.
Whoa.
We need to go back.
To the moment this all began.
And we need to find out who... or what is erasing that show and stop it.
But I'll need your help.
Are you with me, Crono Teens?
I'm 23.
Then raise your right hand.
Okay.
Do you vow to preserve the past?
We vow. Yes.
Do you swear to defend the future?
We swear. I swear.
Do you have any homework due tomorrow?
Give me one second.
Sue, you've gotta finish your paper.
Um, he has a time machine, duh.
We're good. .
In that case...
Crono Teens unite.
lt goes on top. Yeah, that was self explanatory, sorry.
Are you ready to ride the timeline, kids?
Yeah!
Let's ride.
My gosh, my gosh.
Yes.
Is it over?
This never gets old.
One second.
Okay.
These Invisibracelets are linked to the ROYGBIV scrambalizer on my Crono Gauntlet.
As long as you wear them, no one from the past can see you or hear you.
This is so cool.
Okay, Alex, here we go.
Tada!
No, no, that's too much crotch.
Tada!
Why, why Jazz hands?
What am I doing?
All right...
Tadow!
Yeah.
You got a fastforward button on that thing?
I am rank.
Tada!
You've already finished it.
Let's just... let's keep moving.
You know, by the time he actually gets around to reading it, it'll be like 12:30, so.
Sue, if you don't finish it
I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Okay, tell you what, if someone from the future invents time travel...
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Look, my toys.
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet.
This isn't the past, it's the past of your past.
Could this be any more confusing?
It's our past before our timeline's changed.
Does that mean...
Okay, you remember that episode of "Time Ryder"
where they get stuck in ancient Rome?
Really, another Time Ryder story?
Okay, let's go down this rabbit hole again.
You remember the show.
I don't remember remembering the show.
Season two lt's like you really did get hit with a memo eraser.
That's impossible.
The only memo eraser on active service is right...
Looking for this?
Entropy.
I've waited a long time for this.
But in some ways it's been no time at all.
Prepare yourself Time Ryder.
It looks like time is about to ride you!
Hey, asshole.
 
Okay, first of all, I knew I wasn't the stinky one.
And second of all, who or what the hell was that?
Remember when I told you I come from a future that's great?
No. Well, I did.
Anyway, Entropy comes from a future that sucks.
Of course!
Entropy's the one trying to erase our show.
With my memories, damn.
We played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Entropy could attack anywhere at any time.
There he is.
I am rank.
Damn.
Why us, why now?
We'll ask him when we catch him.
Got a fastforward button on that thing?
Let's keep moving.
Whywhy would he do that?
Let's move.
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
There.
My toys...
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet, this isn't your past, it's the past of your past.
Can this be any more confusing?
Sure can, buddy.
Entropy should reappear to steal my memo eraser
in T minus There he is.
He stole the memo thing.
Damn!
Tracking his signature.
He's coming back around.
The only memo eraser in active service is right...
Looking for this?
Got him.
Hey, asshole.
Damn, we played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride!
Okay, and what the hell was that?
Maybe we won.
Maybe Time Ryder got the cuffs on him and he's hauling him off to Time Base One.
Ryder!
What is that smell?
My God, is he dead?
He's alive.
Okay, so what what do we do?
'Cause, I mean, has anything like this ever happened on the show?
Actually, in episode 304.
Of course.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Relax, I've seen this done a million times on the show, it's just... Oops. Oops?
Just let me close out of this.
All right.
 One second.
I got it!
Wait, wait, you should probably stay on the bed with me.
It's safer.
Tada!
No, too much crotch.
Tadano.
It's jazz hands.
All right.
Tadow.
Tadow!
I am rank.
What?
Looking for this?
No!
Tada!
Entropy, you're under arrest for causality violations in Continuum Sector 818.
Nice moves, Crono Teens.
Thanks for leaving that note.
Wait, we didn't leave a note.
Guess I left it for myself.
Not a bad move.
You know, it's against regulations to take a Crono Captain's memo eraser without his consent.
I know, but it was the only way to make sure the Entropy didn't completely erase everything.
It looks like it worked.
Hey...
I think I remember the TV show.
Including that shitty Christmas special you did.
Everyone's a critic, aren't they?
Well, it seems as though the timeline is back on course, and this case is history.
That's it?
Crono Squad thanks you for your service.
No, no, that that can't be it.
I mean, what was he doing here?
Why did he coming after us?
I have so many questions.
Of course you do.
You're a scientist, Sue.
But your place is in here now.
Entropy's secrets belong to the future.
Will I ever will we ever see you again?
Only time will tell.
Jesus.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take this... scum back to Time Base One.
Au revoir, Crono Teens.
Let's ride.
Yes!
Yes, yes.
Au revoir.
Well, that was... an interesting way to spend an evening.
Oof.
So... back to work?
How can you say that?
What?
We just traveled through time.
We were Crono Teens.
We can't just pretend like that didn't happen.
Ryder was right, this is where we belong.
I can't go back to the way things were.
Backthis is the back, Sue.
We are back, and you got a lot of work to do.
You're right.
What are you look.
We do.
Is it happening.
It's Entropy's ring.
The source of all his power.
Great, II wonder what it's doing here.
I don't know, but as Crono Teens, it's our duty to pass it off to the right authorities.
Are you kid.
Of course it is.
We should give it back to Time Base One.
It'll be safe there.
I mean, what if it got into the wrong hands?
It already is in the wrong hands.
Don't you wanna see Time Base One?
It's one of the seven wonders of the galaxy, and to set this right?
No!
I don't.
So, if you wanna play time teen, by all means, butbut you're on your own, okay?
Fine, suit yourself.
No, that's the wrong answer.
Sue, Sue, you sit down on this bed, SueSue!
Time Base One!
No!
Hey.
Those were on your.
Where are we?
I thought Time Base One was in the future.
I thought so too.
Judging by the freshness of that guy's kicks,
I'd say we were in 1995.
We're in the '90s.
Of course.
Ahem!
Hi.
We're here to see Time Ryder.
Did you have an appointment?
No, but we came to give him this.
What did you say your name was?
Susan Hirsch.
Yeah, well, come on in, Miss Hirsch.
Yeah, please.
I'll get this to Captain Ryder right away.
What is going on?
Don't you see, Alex?
Time Base One is Sundial Cartoons.
That's why the show looks just like the future because the show is made by people from the future.
So, this guy right here is from the future?
They all are.
Think about it.
Crono Squad's entire mission is to protect humanity's future, and what better way to do that than by inspiring the children of the past.
Is that who I think it is?
I don't know.
Listen, we saw this place.
Can we please leave?
Hey, future guy.
Nice corduroys.
Yeah.
Mr. Nash?
II'm a really big fan of your show.
I actually saw you a while back at CronoCon.
Well, I guess 20 years from now, but um...
I'm rambling.
Can I get you to sign something for me?
Name?
Susan Hirsch.
Susan Hirsch?
Wally.
Wally Nash.
It's an honor to meet you, young lady.
It is?
Well, of course it is.
You'll have to excuse us if we're all a little star struck.
It's not every day we meet the Mother of Time.
Yeah, that's me.
Mother of Time.
Come on, guys.
Miss Hirsch has some urgent business with Captain Ryder.
Guys, come on.
Okay, what's the problem?
We've been trying to send Lord Snappington here back to Time Jail, but we can't get a signature lock.
Have you compensated for signal interference?
That's just it, the channel's clear, but we can only read Time Jail for a few seconds at a time, almost as if it's.
It's flickering out of existence.
Is that you, Time Ryder?
I know you can hear me.
What have you done?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is Deutsch's model, you want Lloyd's model.
You ever see "Time, Time Again"?
Yeah, this whole thing is a mess.
Thanks.
When's it due again?
Midnight.
Thank God for time travel.
Right.
Wait, what?
What?
I'm whating your what.
So clarify your what.
You still have enough time to do your paper, right?
Yes, I have a time machine.
Um...
Okay, do you know how time travel works?
Do you know how time'cause I'm...
I have no idea.
You know what the best part of an eternity in Time Jail was?
I had eternity to think up the perfect plan.
Even though you are in the past right now, your present continues to move forward without you.
Okay.
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
Sorry, I gotta get out of here.
As we learned with the LoganPrescott Theory
I know this, any object traveling through time must return to its own present.
Yes. .
So even though you are in 1996 right now, and it's 2:45pm.
That means in my own present time it's...
Crap.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, II have to go.
Sue, Sue.
LoganPrescott Theorem.
Don't freak out, but our present is happening
without us. I know.
You know?
You lied to me?
I'm sorry.
I just had to see this place.
It was a mistake, it was a big, big mistake.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
No, the paper.
Timeline breach detected.
Entropy, you scum.
Save your anger for the Mother of Time.
She lied to you, Time Ryder.
What are you talking about?
Her homework?
No, she took an oath.
I must've come up with a million ways to exact my revenge.
This one wasn't the best, but it was the most ironic.
It seems you don't need an army or a doomsday weapon to destroy the future, all you need is to give Susan Hirsch what she always wanted... a chance to star in a reallife.
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens" adventure.
You're forgetting one thing, smart guy.
You're in here.
Who's gonna get you out of that?
Isn't it obvious?
I am.
Hey, Captain.
Susan Hirsch is here.
What, how?
She came to bring you this.
Thank you.
Greetings from the future, Time Ryder.
No!
Thank you.
Damn.
Susan, how could you do this?
I've let you down, I'm sorry.
What's happening?
She didn't do her paper.
She's gonna flunk out of school.
But if she flunks out of school, she won't get into grad school.
She doesn't go to grad school, she'll never invent time travel.
She doesn't invent time travel, the future will never exist, and neither will we.
Okay, let's just all calm down.
My God, we're all gonna die!
Well, we're still here, which means we still have a chance.
My paper's due at midnight.
It's 11:30, and I haven't even started.
You haven't even started?
Well, I started thinking about it.
But... every time I go to write this stupid paper, it's it's hard, and I'm worried I'm gonna be a big failure and let everyone down, so I...
I put it off, and I watch cartoons.
I am not the Mother of Time.
I will never be her.
I'm a failure.
No. You're not a failure yet.
Look, the paper's due on his desk at midnight, but he's probably not gonna get to it till 12:30.
So what?
So, if we can stall him, if we can get him out of that office, we can buy Sue time to finish her paper.
Did I get that right?
Is that how time travel works?
'Cause I'm just a plus one here.
Sue's lessimportant friend is right.
Yeahall right.
We can buy you the time.
Can you get the job done?
Of course she can.
She's a Crono Teen.
Yeah, I can do it.
Hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Term paper.
The universe hangs in the balance.
Start with your name.
Your professor.
The date.
First sentence.
Whoever's doing this, it's not funny!
The dean's gonna find out about it.
Kicked out of school!
It's worth it.
Hello!
Hah!
Great.
More kneeling.
It seems you cannot reach your Gauntlet.
You can't snap your fingers, asshole.
Then I suppose we will just have to stay like this... forever.
Hey!
Professor Dobkin.
Alex, was that you the whole time?
Was what me?
You're fighting stinks worse than your breath.
Breathe it in!
You know you dropped some papers back there?
No, I got 'em all right here.
No, I'm pretty sure you dropped more
Alex.
Okay, fine, you know what?
You flunk me, okay?
Because if there's anything I've learned from this adventure it's that
Okay, you're flunked. What?
Go away.

I couldn't stop Dobkin.
Alex, what's going on?
You need to hurry, Sue.
I'm typing as fast as I can think.
Don't flip out!
Heads up.
I think I can do this, Alex.
I'm so close.
Let's table this conversation.
No!
Are you there, Alex?
Alex?
My God, it's so simple.
Alex, what's going on?
Sue?
Keep working on that paper.
Can you feel it?
Your future fading away?
Just let it happen.
Nothing can stop the spread of Entropy!
Thank you.
No!
Sue!
Alex, what's going on?
Is that you, Time Ryder?
What happened to Alex?
Man down, Sue.
You can stop writing.
What?
I'mI'm almost finished.
It's too late.
You need to get out of there.
The Temporo Porter, go.
It's over, Alex is gone.
Timeline collapse imminent.
Get to the platform, I can send you back to your present.
You'll be safe, but you have to hurry.
What about you?
It's too late for me.
In 30 seconds that machine won't exist anymore and you'll be stuck in the pastgo.
Okay, I'm inside.
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.
Goodbye, Time Ryder.
Paradox detected.
It's not working.
"Paradox detected," what the hell is it talking about?
It's talking about me.
Episode 23.
The problem with paradoxes, in about 30 seconds I'll be a girl who remembers a show that never existed, which makes me a living, breathing paradox.
And you can't return to the present until the paradox is resolved.
How do I resolve it?
No.
No, no, that is not an option.
It's your only option.
Then I'll find another one!
Sue, you can stay in the past forever or let me go and face the future on your own.
I can't, I mean, look at me, I'm a mess.
I can'tI can't do this without you.
Of course you can.
And I'll tell you why... because you are special.
You can achieve incredible things.
And the greatest power in the universe... is right between your ears.
You don't need me anymore.
You don't need me.

lt's cute. Thanks.
So, when do I get to see yours?

You haven't started yet?

Sundial Cartoons?
Must be drawing a blank.

- Sue, if you don't finish...
- I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Tell you what... if someone from the future invents
- time travel...
- Mm-hmm.
... I will go back in time... and place my paper right here.
You know in order for that to actually work, you have to write the paper first, right?
You know you've got the wrong equation for closed timeline curves, right?
Shut up, don't change the subject, okay?
'Cause this is about...
what did you just say?
That's Deutsch's model.
What you want is Lloyd's.
Like the "who" versus "whom" of timeline equations.
Oh, my God.
Why did I take theoretical physics?
Okay, maybe this will help.
Remember that episode of Time Ryder where they're stuck in ancient Rome?
Season two, "Time, Time Again."
Season two of what now?
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens."
What is that, like a cartoon or something?
You don't remember "Time Ryder" from the '90s?
Sundial Cartoons?
Must be drawing a blank.
I get it, someone's zapped the memo eraser around you, very funny.
Huh?
Time Ryder uses the memo eraser to erase people's memories...
You know what, we are watching an episode right now.
What about the paper?
Just one episode, I promise.
It'll be a night you remember for the rest of your life.
Oh, boy.
Okay, so it's like Wishbone meets Captain Planet but way cooler than...
Huh.
What is that smell?
I don't...
I don't know, maybe you're having a stroke.
So, anyway, Time Ryder is captain of the Crono Squad.
They defend Earth's timeline, so every week he and the Crono Teens...
Must've taken it down again.
Wait...
What?
No, that's impossible.
- Well, maybe you spelled it wrong.
- That's also impossible.
I was just watching an episode and then you rang, and I stepped on a...
Oh, my God.
- Any luck down there, Alex?
- Not yet.
Uh, hey, don't you have like a friend from high school you could ask?
Friend from high school, that's a good one.
Come on, you don't have one friend that you grew up with?
Of course.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom!
Silly question, but you remember "Time Ryder," right?
Sorry, Time what now?
Time Ryder.
Is that a cartoon or something?
Are you kidding?
I watched the cartoons every day after school.
You bought me the toys every Hanukkah.
Well, put some on your list this year, and we'll see what Jewish Santa can do.
She doesn't remember it either.
It's like the show never even existed.
Alex, do you think I'm crazy?
Um...
Maybe you're just having, like, a panic attack.
Sue, please don't do this.
No time to argue, it's a four-hour bike ride to Sundial Cartoons.
They'll have scripts, they'll have sound,
- they'll have...
- They'll be closed, Sue.
Then I'll peak through the window.
Even if you're right, you're throwing your future away for a cartoon.
It's not real, Sue.
Time Ryder is not real.
History needs your help.
Time Ryder!
I come from the future.
No, a future.
A future where mankind has reached its full potential.
A future in peril... because there's something that happens here tonight.
Something that changes the course of history.
I have traveled to this locus of space and time on a desperate mission to stop it.
So I ask you... in the name of the future of humankind have you kids seen any weird shit going on tonight?
Okay, uh, one second, guy.
Sue, we gotta call the cops.
This dude is nuts.
No, he's not, he's Time Ryder.
Haven't you been listening?
He's in a turquoise motorcycle outfit.
Listen, there can't be a Time Ryder.
You said it yourself, Time Ryder's a cartoon.
Yeah, and he's sitting right in front of us.
Oh, well, that's the coolest shit
I've ever seen in my life.
Please continue.
You're right, smart guy.
Time Ryder is a cartoon.
One that inspires an entire generation of young minds to pursue science, including the inventor of time travel.
I told you it was a really good show.
Well, we try.
Wait a second, that's it.
Somehow the entire show is disappearing from existence.
No one remembers it, even my toys have disappeared.
My God.
That show is the most important piece of children's entertainment in the universe.
It's the foundation on which my future was built.
And if it disappears...
My future's history.
Whoa.
We need to go back.
To the moment this all began.
And we need to find out who... or what is erasing that show and stop it.
But I'll need your help.
Are you with me, Crono Teens?
- I'm 23.
- Then raise your right hand.
Okay.
Do you vow to preserve the past?
- We vow.
- Uh, yes.
Do you swear to defend the future?
- We swear.
- I swear.
Do you have any homework due tomorrow?
Mmm, give me one second.
Sue, you've gotta finish your paper.
Um, he has a time machine, duh.
- We're good.
- Mm-hmm.
In that case...
Crono Teens unite.
It goes on top.
Yeah, that was self explanatory, sorry.
Are you ready to ride the timeline, kids?
Yeah!
Let's ride.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
Oh, yes.
Is it over?
Mm, this never gets old.
_
One second.
Okay.
These Invisibracelets are linked to the ROYGBIV scrambalizer on my Crono Gauntlet.
As long as you wear them, no one from the past can see you or hear you.
This is so cool.
Okay, Alex, here we go.
Ta-da!
No, no, that's too much crotch.
Uh...
Ta-da!
Why, why Jazz hands?
What am I doing?
All right, uh...
Ta-dow!
Yeah.
You got a fast-forward button on that thing?
Oh, I am rank.
Ta-da!
You've already finished it.
Let's just, uh... let's keep moving.
You know, by the time he actually gets around to reading it, it'll be like 12:30, so...
Sue, if you don't finish it...
I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Okay, tell you what, if someone from the future invents time travel...
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Look, my toys.
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet.
This isn't the past, it's the past of your past.
Could this be any more confusing?
It's our past before our timeline's changed.
Does that mean...
Okay, you remember that episode of "Time Ryder"
where they get stuck in ancient Rome?
Really, another Time Ryder story?
Okay, let's go down this rabbit hole again.
You remember the show.
I don't remember remembering the show.
- Season two...
- It's like you really did get hit with a memo eraser.
That's impossible.
The only memo eraser on active service is right...
Looking for this?
Entropy.
I've waited a long time for this.
But in some ways it's been no time at all.
Prepare yourself Time Ryder.
It looks like time is about to ride you!
Hey, asshole.
Huh?
Oh!
Okay, first of all, I knew I wasn't the stinky one.
And second of all, who or what the hell was that?
Remember when I told you I come from a future that's great?
- No.
- Well, I did.
Anyway, Entropy comes from a future that sucks.
Of course!
Entropy's the one trying to erase our show.
With my memories, damn.
We played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Entropy could attack anywhere at any time.
There he is.
Oh, I am rank.
Damn.
Why us, why now?
We'll ask him when we catch him.
Got a fast-forward button on that thing?
Let's keep moving.
Why... why would he do that?
Let's move.
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Oh, there.
My toys...
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet, this isn't your past, it's the past of your past.
Can this be any more confusing?
Sure can, buddy.
Entropy should reappear to steal my memo eraser
- in T minus...
- Oh, there he is.
He stole the memo thing.
Damn!
Tracking his signature.
He's coming back around.
The only memo eraser in active service is right...
Looking for this?
Got him.
Hey, asshole.
Oh!
Damn, we played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride!
Okay, and what the hell was that?
Maybe we won.
Maybe Time Ryder got the cuffs on him and he's hauling him off to Time Base One.
Ryder!
What is that smell?
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, my God, is he dead?
He's alive.
Okay, so what... what do we do?
'Cause, I mean, has anything like this ever happened on the show?
Actually, in episode 304...
Of course.
Oh no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Relax, I've seen this done a million times on the show, it's just...
- Oh, oops.
- Oops?
Just let me close out of this.
All right.
Oh!
One second.
I got it!
Wait, wait, you should probably stay on the bed with me.
It's safer.
Ta-da!
Oh, no, too much crotch.
Uh, ta-da... no.
It's jazz hands.
All right.
Ta-dow.
Ta-dow!
Oh!
I am rank.
Uh, what?
- Looking for this?
- No!
Ta-da!
Huh?
Oh!
Entropy, you're under arrest for causality violations in Continuum Sector 818.
Nice moves, Crono Teens.
Thanks for leaving that note.
Wait, we didn't leave a note.
Huh.
Guess I left it for myself.
Not a bad move.
You know, it's against regulations to take a Crono Captain's memo eraser without his consent.
I know, but it was the only way to make sure that Entropy didn't completely erase everything.
It looks like it worked.
Hey...
I think I remember the TV show.
Including that shitty Christmas special you did.
Huh.
Everyone's a critic, aren't they?
Well, it seems as though the timeline is back on course, and this case is history.
That's it?
Crono Squad thanks you for your service.
No, no, that... that can't be it.
I mean, what was he doing here?
Why did he coming after us?
I have so many questions.
Of course you do.
You're a scientist, Sue.
But your place is in here now.
Entropy's secrets belong to the future.
Will I ever... will we ever see you again?
Only time will tell.
Jesus.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take this... scum back to Time Base One.
Au revoir, Crono Teens.
Let's ride.
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes.
Au revoir.
Ugh.
Well, that was... an interesting way to spend an evening.
Oof.
Uh, so... back to work?
How can you say that?
What?
We just traveled through time.
We were Crono Teens.
We can't just pretend like that didn't happen.
Ryder was right, this is where we belong.
I can't go back to the way things were.
Back... this is the back, Sue.
We are back, and you got a lot of work to do.
You're right.
What are you look...
We do.
Is it happening... oh.
It's Entropy's ring.
The source of all his power.
Great, I...
I wonder what it's doing here.
I don't know, but as Crono Teens, it's our duty to pass it off to the right authorities.
Are you kid...
Of course it is.
We should give it back to Time Base One.
It'll be safe there.
I mean, what if it got into the wrong hands?
It already is in the wrong hands.
Don't you wanna see Time Base One?
It's one of the seven wonders of the galaxy, and to set this right?
No!
I don't.
So, if you wanna play time teen, by all means, but... but you're on your own, okay?
Fine, suit yourself.
No, that's the wrong answer.
Sue, Sue, you sit down on this bed, Sue...
Sue!
- Time Base One!
- No!
Oh, hey.
Those were on your...
Uh, where are we?
I thought Time Base One was in the future.
I thought so too.
Judging by the freshness of that guy's kicks,
I'd say we were in 1995.
We're in the '90s.
Of course.
Ahem!
Hi.
We're here to see Time Ryder.
Did you have an appointment?
No, but we came to give him this.
What did you say your name was?
Susan Hirsch.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, well, come on in, Miss Hirsch.
Yeah, please.
I'll get this to Captain Ryder right away.
What is going on?
Don't you see, Alex?
Time Base One is Sundial Cartoons.
That's why the show looks just like the future because the show is made by people from the future.
So, this guy right here... is from the future?
They all are.
Think about it.
Crono Squad's entire mission is to protect humanity's future, and what better way to do that than by inspiring the children of the past.
Is that who I think it is?
I don't know.
Listen, we saw this place.
Can we please leave?
Hey, future guy.
Nice corduroys.
Yeah.
Mr. Nash?
Uh-huh?
I...
I'm a really big fan of your show.
I actually saw you a while back at CronoCon.
Well, I guess 20 years from now, but um...
I'm rambling.
Can I get you to sign something for me?
- Name?
- Susan Hirsch.
Susan Hirsch?
Wally.
Wally Nash.
It's an honor to meet you, young lady.
It is?
Well, of course it is.
You'll have to excuse us if we're all a little star struck.
It's not every day we meet the Mother of Time.
Yeah, that's me.
_
Mother of Time.
Come on, guys.
Miss Hirsch has some urgent business with Captain Ryder.
Guys, come on.
Okay, what's the problem?
We've been trying to send Lord Snappington here back to Time Jail, but we can't get a signature lock.
Have you compensated for signal interference?
That's just it, the channel's clear, but we can only read Time Jail for a few seconds at a time, almost as if it's...
It's flickering out of existence.
Is that you, Time Ryder?
I know you can hear me.
What have you done?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is Deutsch's model, you want Lloyd's model.
You ever see "Time, Time Again"?
Uh...
- Yeah, this whole thing is a mess.
- Thanks.
When's it due again?
Midnight.
Thank God for time travel.
Right.
Wait, what?
What?
I'm whating your what.
So clarify your what.
You still have enough time to do your paper, right?
Yes, I have a time machine.
Uh-oh.
Um...
Okay, do you know how time travel works?
Do you know how time...'cause I'm...
I have no idea.
You know what the best part of an eternity in Time Jail was?
I had eternity to think up the perfect plan.
Even though you are in the past right now, your present continues to move forward without you.
Okay.
_
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
Sorry, I gotta get out of here.
As we learned with the Logan-Prescott Theory...
I know this, any object traveling through time must return to its own present.
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.
So even though you are in 1996 right now, and it's 2:45 pm...
That means in my own present time it's...
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I...
I have to go.
Sue, Sue.
Logan-Prescott Theorem.
Don't freak out, but our present is happening without us.
- I know.
- You know?
- You lied to me?
- I'm sorry.
I just had to see this place.
It was a big mistake, it was a big, big mistake.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Oh no, the paper.
Timeline breach detected.
Entropy, you scum.
Save your anger for the Mother of Time.
She lied to you, Time Ryder.
What are you talking about?
Her homework?
No, she took an oath.
I must've come up with a million ways to exact my revenge.
This one wasn't the best, but it was the most ironic.
It seems you don't need an army or a doomsday weapon to destroy the future, all you need is to give Susan Hirsch what she always wanted... a chance to star in a real-life
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens" adventure.
You're forgetting one thing, smart guy.
You're in here.
Who's gonna get you out of that?
Isn't it obvious?
I am.
Hey, Captain.
Susan Hirsch is here.
What, how?
She came to bring you this.
Thank you.
Greetings from the future, Time Ryder.
No!
Thank you.
Damn.
_
Susan, how could you do this?
I've let you down, I'm sorry.
What's happening?
She didn't do her paper.
She's gonna flunk out of school.
But if she flunks out of school, she won't get into grad school.
She doesn't go to grad school, she'll never invent time travel.
She doesn't invent time travel, the future will never exist, and neither will we.
Okay, let's just all calm down.
Oh, my God, we're all gonna die!
Well, we're still here, which means we still have a chance.
My paper's due at midnight.
It's 11:30, and I haven't even started.
You haven't even started?
Well, I started thinking about it.
But.... every time I go to write this stupid paper, it's... it's hard, and I'm worried I'm gonna be a big failure and let everyone down, so I...
I put it off, and I watch cartoons.
I am not the Mother of Time.
I will never be her.
I'm a failure.
- No.
- You're not a failure yet.
Look, the paper's due on his desk at midnight, but he's probably not gonna get to it till 12:30.
So what?
So, if we can stall him, if we can get him out of that office, we can buy Sue time to finish her paper.
Did I get that right?
Is that how time travel works?
'Cause I'm just a plus one here.
Sue's less-important friend is right.
Yeah... all right.
We can buy you the time.
Can you get the job done?
Of course she can.
She's a Crono Teen.
Yeah, I can do it.
Hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Term paper.
The universe hangs in the balance.
Start with your name.
Your professor.
The date.
First sentence.
Whoever's doing this, it's not funny!
The dean's gonna find out about it.
You're gonna get kicked out of school!
It's worth it.
Hello!
Hah!
Great.
More kneeling.
It seems you cannot reach your Gauntlet.
You can't snap your fingers, asshole.
Then I suppose we will just have to stay like this... forever.
Hey!
Professor Dobkin.
Alex, was that you the whole time?
Was what me?
You're fighting stinks worse than your breath.
Breathe it in!
You know you dropped some papers back there?
No, I got 'em all right here.
No, I'm pretty sure you dropped more...
Alex.
Ah!
Okay, fine, you know what?
You flunk me, okay?
Because if there's anything I've learned
- from this adventure it's that...
- Okay, you're flunked.
- What?
- Go away.
I was gonna...
I couldn't stop Dobkin.
Alex, what's going on?
You need to hurry, Sue.
I'm typing as fast as I can think.
Don't flip out!
Heads up.
I think I can do this, Alex.
I'm so close.
Let's table this conversation.
Oh, no!
Are you there, Alex?
Alex?
Oh, my God, it's so simple.
- Alex, what's going on?
- Sue?
Keep working on that paper.
Can you feel it?
Your future fading away?
Just let it happen.
Nothing can stop the spread of Entropy!
Thank you.
No!
Sue!
Alex, what's going on?
Is that you, Time Ryder?
What happened to Alex?
Man down, Sue.
You can stop writing.
What?
I'm...
I'm almost finished.
It's too late.
You need to get out of there.
The Temporo Porter, go.
It's over, Alex is gone.
Timeline collapse imminent.
Get to the platform, I can send you back to your present.
You'll be safe, but you have to hurry.
What about you?
It's too late for me.
In 30 seconds that machine won't exist anymore and you'll be stuck in the past... go.
Okay, I'm inside.
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.
Goodbye, Time Ryder.
Paradox detected.
It's not working.
"Paradox detected," what the hell is it talking about?
It's talking about me.
Episode 23.
The problem with paradoxes, in about 30 seconds I'll be a girl who remembers a show that never existed, which makes me a living, breathing paradox.
And you can't return to the present until the paradox is resolved.
How do I resolve it?
No.
No, no, that is not an option.
It's your only option.
Then I'll find another one!
Sue, you can stay in the past forever or let me go and face the future on your own.
I can't, I mean, look at me, I'm a mess.
I can't...
I can't do this without you.
Of course you can.
And I'll tell you why because you are special.
You can achieve incredible things.
And the greatest power in the universe is right between your ears.
You don't need me anymore.
You don't need me...
Ryder!
Crono Teens unite.
You are special.
You can achieve incredible things.
The greatest power in the universe...
The greatest power in the universe... is right between your ears.
... is right between your ears.
Hmm.
One second.
Ta-da!
You've already finished it?
Well, pending the Sue Hirsch seal of approval, of course.
"Exploring Quantum Paradoxes" by Alex Kapur.
- It's cute.
- Thanks.
So, when do I get to see yours?
See my what?
Um, your paper.
What did you end up writing about?
Uh, you know, sciency physics stuff.
You haven't started yet?
Okay, don't panic.
If time travel is invented...
- Don't do this again, Sue.
- ... in the future,
I would leave it right here?
_
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle One to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread Lost Horse Canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
I want to take it...
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
Eagle One to base, we've been hit.
Jake:
Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
I'm losing hydraulics!
Alicia:
Travis!
Travis, what are you doing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stay in your seat!
Ali:
No!
Alicia!
Travis!
Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Por favor, señora.
_
No, señor, no.
Por favor.
No, señor.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Hector!
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Señora... _
_
And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Da nada, asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, Luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That...
- No.
- Maybe...
- No.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Troy:
Jake already talk to him?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now, come on, get out.
Joe, watch them.
Close it.
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah...
Oh...
Ah.
_
_
_
Gracias.
Muy bien.
Strand.
_
_
_
Dr. Strand?
Uh... _
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
_
_
_
_
_
_
Hey, hey!
_
_
_
_

Madison:
Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the ridge.
But most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Little cream and sugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Oh.
Well... sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.
Oh, yeah, it was.
Venus was like a flare across the sky all night long.
Were you up stargazing?
Upside to insomnia.
Ma'am, I...
I got to ask you...
Madison...
Clark.
Miss Clark.
Any reason to think your husband may have diverted the Huey?
You mean hijacked?
No.
My daughter was with him.
He'd do anything to get her here safe.
Okay.
That's all I needed to know.
Where would he go?
I had to ask.
Why?
Because I was up all night.
My son and my goddaughter are on that chopper.
And I put a spoon in your other son's eye.
Guess he's lucky it wasn't a fork.
That your boy over there?
Yeah.
Nick.
Welcome, Nick.
Joseph, the gate.
Welcome to Broke Jaw Ranch.
It's not safe.
Right now we're just two families with missing loved ones.
I don't trust these people.
Don't trust them.
Trust me.
Otto:
People bought in here before the world ended.
They prepared for the fall of democracy.
Banked on that.
But this rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.
- Madison:
You seem to be managing.
- Otto:
Yeah.
We're fairly self-sustaining.
Madison:
Yeah, and heavily armed.
Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Self-defense is the cornerstone.
Is that what Troy was doing back at the border?
Self-defense?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.
I heard his side of it.
Want to hear ours?
We're, uh, building a new nation here.
It's not perfect.
It's very imperfect.
I'll sort out what happened at the border when Jake gets back.
Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.
Most people would be damn grateful for being here.
I had the idea you might be, too.
Was I wrong?
It ain't much, but it's clean.
Latrines and showers are in the back.
I'd shake the mattresses and sweep the floor out for scorpions and such.
Thank you.
Don't start.
- You're thanking him?
- Shh, lower your voice.
His son's a murderer!
Nick!
You want to go to war with them, huh?
All of them?
You want to start that fight?
Then you'll see murder.
You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, Jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if...
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
It won't be like that when we get back.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Since he was little.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It's a lot of land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, I...
I know.
- I...
- It's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.
Hand me the gun.
Find your way back.
Quickly.
Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.
Hector:
Felicitaciones... doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
I brought some food.
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Stowe, I was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
Victor:
You should get some air in here.
That's a start.
Aw, man.
I was thinking the same thing.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
And nothing to get me there.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, I felt... if this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation... that might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, Ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
Jake:
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Man:
Here, let me in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is Trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
Alicia:
I'm sorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
Jake:
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- Otto:
By who?
- Jake:
Unknown.
Where's Charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Nick:
Hey, it's Nick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What... what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
Help her.
No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
- Nick:
No.
Come on.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
Otto:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick:
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Jake:
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Come on.
Let...
Let me have the pistol, son.
You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
Get her to the infirmary.
Man ♪2:
Yes, sir.
Otto:
Secure her before you treat her.
Otto:
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
Oh, God...
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and Coke.
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in God, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss... sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, in this new age... presents another set of problems.
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger... to yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a Beretta 418 from the fuel truck.
I thought maybe if you borrowed it... you might want to sign for it now.
It's camp policy.
I always thought of that model as more a...
A lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
I truly am.
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
I'm sure he was... to be with a woman like you.
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't...
- It was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom... that's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
We have to accept it.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle one to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread lost horse canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
I want to take it...
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
Eagle one to base, we've been hit.
Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
I'm losing hydraulics!
Travis!
Travis, what are you doing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stay in your seat!
Ali... no!
Alicia!
Travis!
Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.
*FEAR THE WALKING DEAD Season 03 Episode 02 "The New Frontier"
Por favor, señora.
No, señor, no.
Por favor.
- No, señor.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Hector!
Señora...
And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Da nada, asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That...
- no.
- Maybe...
- no.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Jake already talk to him?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now, come on, get out.
Joe, watch them.
Close it.
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than Goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah...
Oh...
Ah.
Muy bien.
Strand.
Dr. strand?
Uh...
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
Hey, hey!
Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the Ridge.
But... most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Little cream and sugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Oh.
Well...
Sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.

This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That-- - no.
- Maybe-- - no.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Jakealreadytalktohim?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now,comeon ,getout .
Joe, watch them.
Close it.
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah...
Oh...
Ah.
Gracias.
Muybien.
Strand.
Dr. strand?
Uh...
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
Hey, hey!
Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the Ridge.
But most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Littlecreamandsugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Oh.
Well...
Sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.
Oh, yeah, it was.
Venus was like a flare across the sky all night long.
Were you up stargazing?
Upside to insomnia.
Ma'am, I...
I got to ask you...
Madison...
Clark.
Miss Clark.
Any reason to think your husband may have diverted the huey?
You mean hijacked?
No.
My daughter was with him.
He'd do anything to get her here safe.
Okay.
That'sall Ineededto know.
Where would he go?
I had to ask.
Why?
Because I was up all night.
My son and my goddaughter are on that chopper.
And I put a spoon in your other son's eye.
Guess he's lucky it wasn't a fork.
That your boy over there?
Yeah.
Nick.
Welcome, Nick.
Joseph,thegate.
Welcome to broke jaw ranch.
It's not safe.
Right now we're just two families with missing loved ones.
I don't trust these people.
Don't trust them.
Trust me.
People bought in here before the world ended.
They prepared for the fall of democracy.
Banked on that.
But the rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.
- You seem to be managing.
- Yeah.
We're fairly self-sustaining.
Yeah, and heavily armed.
Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Self-defense is the cornerstone.
Is that what Troy was doing back at the border?
Self-defense?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.
I heard his side of it.
Want to hear ours?
We're, uh, building a new nation here.
It's not perfect.
It's very imperfect.
I'llsortoutwhathappenedat the border when Jake gets back.
Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.
Most people would be damn grateful for being here.
I had the idea you might be, too.
Was I wrong?
It ain't much, but it's clean.
Latrines and showers are in the back.
I'd shake the mattresses and sweep the floor out for scorpions and such.
Thank you.
Don't start.
- You're thanking him?
- Shh, lower your voice.
His son's a murderer!
Nick!
You want to go to war with them, huh?
All of them?
You want to start that fight?
Then you'll see murder.

You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if...
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
Itwon'tbe likethat whenwegetback.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Sincehewaslittle.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It'sa lotof land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, i-
- I know.
- I-- - it's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.
Hand me the gun.
Find your way back.
Quickly.
Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.
Felicitaciones...
Doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
I brought some food.
What are you doing here?
Mrs. stowe, i was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
Youshould get some air in here.
That's a start.
Aw,man.
Iwasthinking thesamething.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
And nothing to get me there.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, i felt...
If this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation...
That might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
-
- Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Here,letme in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
I'msorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- By who?
- Unknown.
Where's charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Hey,it'sNick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What-- what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
- Help her.
- No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
- No.
Come on.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
Whoa,whoa,whoa.
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Comeon.
Let-- let me have the pistol, son.
You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
Get her to the infirmary.
Yes,sir.
Secureher before you treat her.
Allright,everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
Oh, god...
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and coke.
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in god, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss...
Sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, inthisnewage ...
Presents another set of problems.
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger...
To yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a beretta 418 fromthefueltruck.
Ithoughtmaybe ifyouborrowedit...
You might want to sign for it now.
It'scamppolicy.
I always thought of that model as more a-- a lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh--
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
Itrulyam .
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
I'msurehe was...
Tobewith awomanlikeyou .
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't-- - it was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom...
That's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
Wehaveto acceptit.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle one to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread lost horse canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
I want to take it--
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
- Eagle one to base, we've been hit.
Jake:
Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
I'm losing hydraulics!
Alicia:
Travis!
Travis, whatareyoudoing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stayinyourseat!
Ali-- no!
Alicia!
Travis!
Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.
Porfavor,señora.
No,señor,no .
Porfavor.
No,señor.
Hey,hey,hey!
Hey!
Hector!
Señora...
And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Danada,asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That-- - no.
- Maybe-- - no.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Troy:
Jakealreadytalktohim?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now,comeon ,getout .
Joe, watch them.
Close it.
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah...
Oh...
Ah.

Strand.
Dr. strand?
Uh...
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
Hey, hey!
Madison:

I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and coke.
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in god, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss...
Sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, inthisnewage ...
Presents another set of problems.
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger...
To yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a beretta 418 fromthefueltruck.
Ithoughtmaybe ifyouborrowedit...
You might want to sign for it now.
It'scamppolicy.
I always thought of that model as more a-- a lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh--
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
Itrulyam .
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
I'msurehe was...
Tobewith awomanlikeyou .
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't-- - it was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom...
That's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
Wehaveto acceptit.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle one to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread lost horse canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
I want to take it...
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
Eagle one to base, we've been hit.
Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
I'm losing hydraulics!
Travis!
Travis, what are you doing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stay in your seat!
Ali... no!
Alicia!
Travis!
Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.
Por favor, señora.
No, señor, no.
Por favor.
No, señor.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Hector!
Señora...
And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Da nada, asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to doubletime it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That...
- No.
- Maybe...
- No.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Jake already talk to him?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now, come on, get out.
Joe, watch them.
Close it.
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Gracias.
Muy bien.
Strand.
Dr. strand?
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
Hey, hey!
Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the Ridge.
But most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Little cream and sugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Well...
Sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.
Yeah, it was.
Venus was like a flare across the sky all night long.
Were you up stargazing?
Upside to insomnia.
Ma'am, I...
I got to ask you...
Madison...
Clark.
Miss Clark.
Any reason to think your husband may have diverted the huey?
You mean hijacked?
No.
My daughter was with him.
He'd do anything to get her here safe.
Okay.
That's all I needed to know.
Where would he go?
I had to ask.
Why?
Because I was up all night.
My son and my goddaughter are on that chopper.
And I put a spoon in your other son's eye.
Guess he's lucky it wasn't a fork.
That your boy over there?
Yeah.
Nick.
Welcome, Nick.
Joseph, the gate.
Welcome to broke jaw ranch.
It's not safe.
Right now we're just two families with missing loved ones.
I don't trust these people.
Don't trust them.
Trust me.
People bought in here before the world ended.
They prepared for the fall of democracy.
Banked on that.
But the rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.
You seem to be managing.
Yeah.
We're fairly selfsustaining.
Yeah, and heavily armed.
Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Selfdefense is the cornerstone.
Is that what Troy was doing back at the border?
Selfdefense?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.
I heard his side of it.
Want to hear ours?
We're, building a new nation here.
It's not perfect.
It's very imperfect.
I'll sort out what happened at the border when Jake gets back.
Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.
Most people would be damn grateful for being here.
I had the idea you might be, too.
Was I wrong?
It ain't much, but it's clean.
Latrines and showers are in the back.
I'd shake the mattresses and sweep the floor out for scorpions and such.
Thank you.
Don't start.
- You're thanking him?
- Shh, lower your voice.
His son's a murderer!
Nick!
You want to go to war with them?
All of them?
You want to start that fight?
Then you'll see murder.
.
You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if...
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
It won't be like that when we get back.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Since he was little.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It's a lot of land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, I...
I know.
- I...
- It's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.
Hand me the gun.
Find your way back.
Quickly.
Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.
Felicitaciones...
Doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
I brought some food.
What are you doing here?
Mrs. stowe, I was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
You should get some air in here.
That's a start.
Aw, man.
I was thinking the same thing.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
And nothing to get me there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, I felt...
If this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation...
That might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Here, let me in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- By who?
- Unknown.
Where's charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Hey, it's Nick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What... what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
- Help her.
- No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
No.
Come on.
Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Come on.
Let...
Let me have the pistol, son.
You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
Get her to the infirmary.
Yes, sir.
Secure her before you treat her.
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
God...
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and coke.
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in god, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.

Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a beretta 418 from the fuel truck.
I thought maybe if you borrowed it...
You might want to sign for it now.
It's camp policy.
I always thought of that model as more a...
A lady's pistol anyway.
I'm...
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
I truly am.
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
I'm sure he was...
To be with a woman like you.
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
Ho.
My style and my color.
Mom?
Close the door.

I'm okay.

Yeah, holding that baby, I felt... if this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation... that might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, Ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Here, let me in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is Trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- Otto:
By who?
- Jake:
Unknown.
Where's Charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Hey, it's Nick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What... what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
Help her.
No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
- No.
Come on.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Come on.
Let...
Let me have the pistol, son.
You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
Get her to the infirmary.
Yes, sir.
Secure her before you treat her.
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
Oh, God...
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and Coke.
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in God, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss... sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, in this new age... presents another set of problems.
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger... to yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a Beretta 418 from the fuel truck.
I thought maybe if you borrowed it... you might want to sign for it now.
It's camp policy.
I always thought of that model as more a...
A lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
I truly am.
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
I'm sure he was... to be with a woman like you.
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't...
- It was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom... that's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
We have to accept it.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle one to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread lost horse canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
- I want to take it-- - ( Glass shatters )
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
- Eagle one to base, we've been hit.
- ( Glass shatters )
( Panting )
Jake:
Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
- ( Alarm beeping )
- I'm losing hydraulics!
Alicia:
Travis!
Travis, whatareyoudoing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stayinyourseat!
( Beeping continues )
Ali-- no!
Alicia!
- ( Exhales )
- Travis!
( Jake echoing ) Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.

And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Danada,asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That-- - no.
- Maybe-- - no.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.

Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Troy:
Jakealreadytalktohim?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now,comeon ,getout .
- Joe, watch them.
- ( Engine starts )
- Close it.
- ( Gate creaking )
(Distantdogsbarking)
( Sighs )
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah... ( Groaning )
Oh... ( Chuckles )
Ah.
( Speaking Spanish )
- ( Chuckles )
- Gracias.
Muybien.
Strand.
( Sobbing )
Dr. strand?
Uh...
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
Hey, hey!
( Chatter in Spanish )
( Panting )
Madison:
Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the Ridge.
But most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Littlecreamandsugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Oh.
Well...
Sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.
Oh, yeah, it was.
Venus was like a flare across the sky all night long.
Were you up stargazing?
Upside to insomnia.
Ma'am, I...
I got to ask you...
Madison...
Clark.
Miss Clark.
Any reason to think your husband may have diverted the huey?
You mean hijacked?
No.
My daughter was with him.
He'd do anything to get her here safe.
Okay.
That'sall Ineededto know.
Where would he go?
I had to ask.
Why?
Because I was up all night.
My son and my goddaughter are on that chopper.
And I put a spoon in your other son's eye.
Guess he's lucky it wasn't a fork.
That your boy over there?
Yeah.
Nick.
Welcome, Nick.
Joseph,thegate.
Welcome to broke jaw ranch.
It's not safe.
Right now we're just two families with missing loved ones.
I don't trust these people.
Don't trust them.
Trust me.
( Sighs )
Otto:
People bought in here before the world ended.
They prepared for the fall of democracy.
Banked on that.
But the rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.
- Madison:
You seem to be managing.
- Otto:
Yeah.
We're fairly self-sustaining.
Madison:
Yeah, and heavily armed.
Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Self-defense is the cornerstone.
Is that what Troy was doing back at the border?
Self-defense?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.
I heard his side of it.
Want to hear ours?
We're, uh, building a new nation here.
It's not perfect.
It's very imperfect.
I'llsortoutwhathappenedat the border when Jake gets back.
Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.
Most people would be damn grateful for being here.
I had the idea you might be, too.
Was I wrong?
It ain't much, but it's clean.
Latrines and showers are in the back.
I'd shake the mattresses and sweep the floor out for scorpions and such.
Thank you.
Don't start.
- You're thanking him?
- Shh, lower your voice.
His son's a murderer!
Nick!
You want to go to war with them, huh?
All of them?
You want to start that fight?
Then you'll see murder.

You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
( Sighs )
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
( Whispers indistinctly )
( Sighs )
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if... ( Whistles )
( Sighs )
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
Itwon'tbe likethat whenwegetback.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Sincehewaslittle.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It'sa lotof land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
(Distantwhistling)
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
( Gun cocks )
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, i-
- I know.
- I-- - it's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.

Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.

Hector:
Felicitaciones...
Doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
( Sighs )
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
- ( Lock beeps )
- Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
( Exhales )
- I brought some food.
- ( Flies buzzing )
( Flies buzzing )
What are you doing here?
Mrs. stowe, i was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
Victor:
You should get some air in here.
That's a start.
( Grunts )
Aw,man.
(Bangson glass)
Iwasthinking thesamething.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
( Grunts )
And nothing to get me there.
(Poundson glass,sighs)
Oh.
( Sighs )
Thank you.
( Sighs )
- ( Waves crashing ) - ( Sighs )
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
( Chuckles )
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, i felt...
If this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation...
That might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
(Rifleclicks)
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.

Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.

Open the gate.

It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.

- Not sure she can hear you.
What-- what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
- Help her.
- No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.

No.
Come on.

Out of the way.

Yes,sir.
Otto:
Secure her before you treat her.
Otto:
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.

- No, I'll find you.

Go.

We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Little cream and sugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Oh.
Well... sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.
Oh, yeah, it was.
Venus was like a flare across the sky all night long.
Were you up stargazing?
Upside to insomnia.
Ma'am, I...
I got to ask you...
Madison...
Clark.
Miss Clark.
Any reason to think your husband may have diverted the Huey?
You mean hijacked?
No.
My daughter was with him.
He'd do anything to get her here safe.
Okay.
That's all I needed to know.
Where would he go?
I had to ask.
Why?
Because I was up all night.
My son and my goddaughter are on that chopper.
And I put a spoon in your other son's eye.
Guess he's lucky it wasn't a fork.
That your boy over there?
Yeah.
Nick.
Welcome, Nick.
Joseph, the gate.
Welcome to Broke Jaw Ranch.
It's not safe.
Right now we're just two families with missing loved ones.
I don't trust these people.
Don't trust them.
Trust me.
[sighs]
Otto:
People bought in here before the world ended.
They prepared for the fall of democracy.
Banked on that.
But this rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.
- Madison:
You seem to be managing.
- Otto:
Yeah.
We're fairly self-sustaining.
Madison:
Yeah, and heavily armed.
Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Self-defense is the cornerstone.
Is that what Troy was doing back at the border?
Self-defense?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.
I heard his side of it.
Want to hear ours?
We're, uh, building a new nation here.
It's not perfect.
It's very imperfect.
I'll sort out what happened at the border when Jake gets back.
Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.
Most people would be damn grateful for being here.
I had the idea you might be, too.
Was I wrong?
It ain't much, but it's clean.
Latrines and showers are in the back.
I'd shake the mattresses and sweep the floor out for scorpions and such.
Thank you.
Don't start.
- You're thanking him?
- Shh, lower your voice.
His son's a murderer!
Nick!
You want to go to war with them, huh?
All of them?
You want to start that fight?
Then you'll see murder.
[sighs]
You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
[sighs]
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
[whispers indistinctly] [sighs]
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, Jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if... [whistles]
[sighs]
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
It won't be like that when we get back.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Since he was little.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It's a lot of land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
[distant whistling]
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
[gun cocks]
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, I...
I know.
- I...
- It's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.
[twig snaps]
[grunts]
[faint snarling]
[snarling]
[rifle clicks]
[yells]
[gunshot] [snarling] [snarling continues] [gunshot]
[Jake panting]
Hand me the gun.
Find your way back.
Quickly.
Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.
[distant gunshot]
Hector:
Felicitaciones... doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
[sighs]
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
- [lock beeps]
- Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
[exhales]
- I brought some food.
- [flies buzzing]
[flies buzzing]
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Stowe, I was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
Victor:
You should get some air in here.
That's a start.
[grunts]
Aw, man. [bangs on glass]
I was thinking the same thing.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
[grunts]
And nothing to get me there.
[pounds on glass, sighs]
Oh.
[sighs]
Thank you.
[sighs]
- [waves crashing] - [sighs]
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
[chuckles]
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, I felt... if this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation... that might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, Ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
[rifle clicks]
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
[radio static hisses] [panting]
- Jake:
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
[men chattering]
- Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Man:
Here, let me in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is Trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- [chatter]
- Alicia:
I'm sorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
Jake:
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- Otto:
By who?
- Jake:
Unknown.
Where's Charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Nick:
Hey, it's Nick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What... what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
Help her.
No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
- Nick:
No.
Come on.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
[breathing heavily]
[cocks gun]
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
[shallow breathing]
Otto:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick:
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Jake:
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Come on.
Let...
Let me have the pistol, son.
[voice breaks] You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
[gun clicks]
Get her to the infirmary.
Man ♪2:
Yes, sir.
Otto:
Secure her before you treat her.
Otto:
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
[sobbing softly]
[coughs] [sniffling, sobbing]
Oh, God... [sniffles, sighs]
[groans]
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and Coke.
[groans]
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in God, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss... sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, in this new age... presents another set of problems.
[groans]
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger... to yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a Beretta 418 from the fuel truck.
I thought maybe if you borrowed it... you might want to sign for it now.
It's camp policy.
I always thought of that model as more a...
A lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
I truly am.
[sighs]
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
- [sighs]
- I'm sure he was... to be with a woman like you.
[crying]
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
[Alicia crying]
[keys jingle] [car alarm chirps]
[chuckles] Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
[engine starts]
[door opens]
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't...
- It was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom... that's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
We have to accept it.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle one to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread lost horse canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
- I want to take it...
- ( Glass shatters )
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
- Eagle one to base, we've been hit.
- ( Glass shatters )
( Panting )
(Jake:) Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
- ( Alarm beeping )
- I'm losing hydraulics!
(Alicia:) Travis!
Travis, what are you doing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stay in your seat!
( Beeping continues )
Ali... no!
Alicia!
- ( Exhales )
- Travis!
( Jake echoing ) Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.
( Seat belt clicks )

( People shouting )
( Speaking Spanish )
Por favor, señora.
No, señor, no.
Por favor.
- No, señor.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Hector!
( Spanish continues )
- ( Grunting ) - ( Crowd shouting )
( Spanish continues )
( Spanish continues )
( Breathing heavily )
Señora... ( Spanish continues )
And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Da nada, asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That...
- no.
- Maybe...
- no.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
( Heavy metal music blaring over car radio )
( Radio turns off )
( Chatter )
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
(Troy:) Jake already talk to him?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now, come on, get out.
- Joe, watch them.
- ( Engine starts )
- Close it.
- ( Gate creaking )
( Distant dogs barking )
( Sighs )
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than Goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah... ( Groaning )
Oh...
Ah.
( Speaking Spanish )
- ( Chuckles )
- Gracias.
Muy bien.
Strand.
( Sobbing )
Dr. strand?
Uh...
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.
Hey, hey!
( Chatter in Spanish )
( Panting )
(Madison:) Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the Ridge.
But... most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.

But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
( Gun clicks )
Get her to the infirmary.
(Man ♪2:) Yes, sir.
(Otto:) Secure her before you treat her.
(Otto:) All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
( Sobbing softly )
( Coughs )
( Sniffling, sobbing )
Oh, God...
( Sniffles, sighs )
( Groans )
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and coke.
( Groans )
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in God, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss...
Sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, in this new age...
Presents another set of problems.
( Groans )
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger...
To yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a beretta 418 from the fuel truck.
I thought maybe if you borrowed it...
You might want to sign for it now.
It's camp policy.
I always thought of that model as more a... a lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
I truly am.
( Sighs )
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
- ( Sighs )
- I'm sure he was...
To be with a woman like you.
( Crying )
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
( Alicia crying )
( Keys jingle )
( Car alarm chirps )
( Chuckles ) Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
( Engine starts )
( Door opens )
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't...
- it was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom...
That's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
We have to accept it.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Synchronized by srjanapala
Nick?
You'll see him soon.
How much longer?
We're about 20 out.
Let's take her up a bit.
She'll get knocked around in higher air, but your call.
Eagle One to base.
We're 20 out.
Commencing radio silence, over.
Charlie, thread Lost Horse Canyon a bit closer to the south.
I know the way home, Jake.
- I want to take it...
- [glass shatters]
- We're taking fire!
- I know, I know.
Evading.
Hold on.
- Eagle One to base, we've been hit.
- [glass shatters] [panting]
Jake:
Travis?
- Travis.
- Help me.
Travis, are you hit?
- [alarm beeping]
- I'm losing hydraulics!
Alicia:
Travis!
Travis, what are you doing?
Help me, help me.
Travis, you're in shock!
Just stay in your seat!
Stop!
Travis!
Jake!
Get in your seat!
Travis, stay in your seat!
[beeping continues]
Ali:
No!
Alicia!
- [exhales]
- Travis!
[Jake echoing] Hey, he's gone!
He's gone, he's gone.
All right, we're going to land hard, okay?
Hold on.

And perhaps an upgrade in my own accommodations.
Gracias.
Gracias.
You and I will have our moment.
You should be thanking me for saving you.
Da nada, asshole.
We waited too long.
This weather won't lift for a few hours.
We need to double-time it.
Yeah, I don't see that happening with her.
Okay, all right.
All right, Luci, we're going to get you out of here.
Hey.
Luciana is as stable as she's going to get.
Whoever shot us may still be out here.
Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone do that?
- Maybe no reason at all.
Someone playing with a toy, but we don't know, so we got to move.
For what it's worth, Alicia, you did the right thing.
Do you think that Travis is out there?
- That...
- No.
- Maybe...
- No.
Nobody, nothing could survive a fall from that height.
I know, but...
He's gone.
And we got to move.
The wreck's a beacon.
I know these mountains.
I can get us home.
Travis would want that.
You don't know what Travis would want.
[heavy metal music blaring over car radio]
[radio turns off]
[chatter]
Joe.
Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?
Your father wants to talk to you.
Troy:
Jake already talk to him?
Jake ain't here.
That's the thing, he ain't been here since he left.
He's overdue.
All right, all right, get out.
- Get out of the truck.
- What?
Get out of the truck and wait outside.
Now, come on, get out.
- Joe, watch them.
- [engine starts]
- Close it.
- [gate creaking]
[distant dogs barking]
[sighs]
They're not here.
Let's just backtrack and find them.
Backtrack to where?
We don't know where they are.
You don't know where you're going.
Better than goddamn waiting.
No, it's not.
We leave, get lost.
They show up, then what?
They have to go find us?
Overreact now could get us killed.
Okay.
And what if they don't show?
Right?
What if it is just you and me?
What's the play then?
Hug your mother.
Just do it now.
Do it.
Where'd you get that?
Pit stop last night.
Glove box of the fuel truck.
Bring our family together, take what we need.
Stop anyone gets in our way.
Ah... [groaning]
Oh... [chuckles]
Ah.
_
_
_
- [chuckles]
- Gracias.
Muy bien.
Strand.
_
_ [sobbing]
_
Dr. Strand?
Uh... _
Maybe we let nature take its course.
And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
- How can you tell?
- You must reach inside her.
Okay, that's not going to happen.

Madison:
Armed patrol at the gate here.
Perimeter watch on the ridge.
But most of these folks are civilians.
Well, we are not civilians, okay?
We do not need this place.
We don't need these people.
Nick, we need someone to treat your girlfriend.
Listen, we are not breaking bread today with the people who tried to kill us yesterday.
They didn't try to kill us.
We don't know them.
- Jesus Christ.
- Nick, you don't have to like what it is you need to survive.
You exploit it.
You turn it to your advantage.
We use them to treat Luciana, fine.
We use them, we go.
Believe me, you don't want me here any longer than necessary.
- Nick...
- I don't know what I'll do.
Ma'am?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Little cream and sugar.
Hope that's how you take it.
Right now I'd take it black, cold, and too weak to defend itself.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.
My daughter, too.
Oh.
Well... sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.
The sky was clear last night.
Oh, yeah, it was.
Venus was like a flare across the sky all night long.
Were you up stargazing?
Upside to insomnia.
Ma'am, I...
I got to ask you...
Madison...
Clark.
Miss Clark.
Any reason to think your husband may have diverted the Huey?
You mean hijacked?
No.
My daughter was with him.
He'd do anything to get her here safe.
Okay.
That's all I needed to know.
Where would he go?
I had to ask.
Why?
Because I was up all night.
My son and my goddaughter are on that chopper.
And I put a spoon in your other son's eye.
Guess he's lucky it wasn't a fork.
That your boy over there?
Yeah.
Nick.
Welcome, Nick.
Joseph, the gate.
Welcome to Broke Jaw Ranch.
It's not safe.
Right now we're just two families with missing loved ones.
I don't trust these people.
Don't trust them.
Trust me.
[sighs]
Otto:
People bought in here before the world ended.
They prepared for the fall of democracy.
Banked on that.
But this rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.
- Madison:
You seem to be managing.
- Otto:
Yeah.
We're fairly self-sustaining.
Madison:
Yeah, and heavily armed.
Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Self-defense is the cornerstone.
Is that what Troy was doing back at the border?
Self-defense?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.
I heard his side of it.
Want to hear ours?
We're, uh, building a new nation here.
It's not perfect.
It's very imperfect.
I'll sort out what happened at the border when Jake gets back.
Meanwhile, this is the safest place to live in a world gone mad.
Most people would be damn grateful for being here.
I had the idea you might be, too.
Was I wrong?
It ain't much, but it's clean.
Latrines and showers are in the back.
I'd shake the mattresses and sweep the floor out for scorpions and such.
Thank you.
Don't start.
- You're thanking him?
- Shh, lower your voice.
His son's a murderer!
Nick!
You want to go to war with them, huh?
All of them?
You want to start that fight?
Then you'll see murder.
[sighs]
You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
[sighs]
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
[whispers indistinctly] [sighs]
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, Jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if... [whistles]
[sighs]
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
It won't be like that when we get back.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Since he was little.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It's a lot of land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
[distant whistling]
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
[gun cocks]
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, I...
I know.
- I...
- It's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.

[gunshot] [snarling] [snarling continues] [gunshot]
[Jake panting]
Hand me the gun.
Find your way back.
Quickly.
Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.
[distant gunshot]
Hector:
Felicitaciones... doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
[sighs]
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
- [lock beeps]
- Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
[exhales]
- I brought some food.
- [flies buzzing]
[flies buzzing]
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Stowe, I was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
Victor:
You should get some air in here.
That's a start.
[grunts]
Aw, man. [bangs on glass]
I was thinking the same thing.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
[grunts]
And nothing to get me there.
[pounds on glass, sighs]
Oh.
[sighs]
Thank you.
[sighs]
- [waves crashing] - [sighs]
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
[chuckles]
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, I felt... if this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation... that might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, Ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
[rifle clicks]
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
[radio static hisses] [panting]
- Jake:
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
[men chattering]
- Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Man:
Here, let me in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is Trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- [chatter]
- Alicia:
I'm sorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
Jake:
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- Otto:
By who?
- Jake:
Unknown.
Where's Charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Nick:
Hey, it's Nick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What... what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
Help her.
No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
- Nick:
No.
Come on.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
[breathing heavily]
[cocks gun]
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
[shallow breathing]
Otto:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick:
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Jake:
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Come on.
Let...
Let me have the pistol, son.
[voice breaks] You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
[gun clicks]
Get her to the infirmary.
Man #2:
Yes, sir.
Otto:
Secure her before you treat her.
Otto:
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.

Then you'll see murder.
You know it's my fault?
I led Lucy and her people to that place, and you came there looking for me.
- That's not on you, son.
- But I got to do something.
No, you don't.
I don't know what our play's going to be.
But right now, we're just going to eat shit, smile, and bide our time.
That's all we can do.
You want to save Luciana.
I want to save all of us, and I will.
But you have to help me.
I'm going to see how many of these assholes are sharpening their knives.
Here.
You take first watch.
That's the short watch.
You won't sleep.
I'll sleep fine.
Watch the draw west of the trail.
I know, Jakey.
I know.
Hey, give a whistle if...
We go back.
Clearly.
What happens to Luciana when we get back to your ranch?
You worried about my brother?
Things he did to her people, things he almost did to mine.
It won't be like that when we get back.
We watch him when he's close.
I can control him.
How long has it been going on?
Since he was little.
My dad, Troy's mom pulled him out of school.
Gave him the run of the ranch.
It's a lot of land.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.
I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.
My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.
At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.
Mine?
What is that?
You know how to use one of these?
- Here's the action.
- Yeah, no, I...
I know.
- I...
- It's ready to fire.
No matter what happens, you stay put till I get back.
If I don't, you follow the main trail.
By midday you'll see the ranch.
Hand me the gun.
Find your way back.
Quickly.
Please.
I have to take care of it before more come.
Felicitaciones... doctor.
The mother would like to name the baby after you.
It's our custom.
You were right.
You calmed the people.
But your lie is now ours.
And if they discover you, they will turn on all of us.
You need to go.
I had hoped for a bit more time.
No.
Now.
Very well.
A vehicle?
None to spare.
You go on foot.
You have one more patient.
Let's not press our luck, Hector.
She is a poor woman who won't leave her room.
She's lost her senses.
She refuses food.
That's tragic.
Convince her to eat.
If she dies, she turns.
Hello?
I brought some food.
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Stowe, I was sent to treat you.
- You're not a doctor.
- True, I'm not.
But I gained some experience treating myself.
I'm sorry.
I did that to you.
You were distraught.
I lost everything.
I was hopeless.
You should get some air in here.
That's a start.
Aw, man.
I was thinking the same thing.
No hope.
I can't stay here, but nowhere to go.
And nothing to get me there.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're an angel.
No hope, no future.
But then last night, they brought in this girl in labor.
I delivered a baby.
It was truly terrifying.
Yeah, holding that baby, I felt... if this child lives, it'd be a new generation.
A new generation... that might give us a reason to hope.
Where would you go were you to leave?
I have a place in mind.
This was supposed to be a wedding gift.
You take it.
It's the least I can do for what I did.
Thank you, Ilene.
No.
Thank you.
You freed my little girl.
But there are no more generations.
I'm sorry.
Luciana's unconscious.
I can't get her to wake up.
I'll carry her.
We'll be at the ranch in a few hours.
It's a terrible world, isn't it?
I'll help you carry her.
We'll make better time.
Just a few more steps.
Stay with me.
Stay awake, stay awake.
Open the gate.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
- Give them a hand.
- Watch your head, watch your head.
- Okay.
Here, let me in there, let me in there.
- Mom...
- Where is he?
Where is Trav?
- Where is he?
- He...
He's not...
No.
No.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Luci.
Luci.
Hey.
Hey, it's Nick.
We were shot down before we got to the ranch.
- By who?
- Unknown.
Where's Charlene?
Dead got her on the pass.
Hey, it's Nick.
- Luci, hey...
- Not sure she can hear you.
What... what do you mean?
She's not going to make it is what he means.
- Help her.
- No.
We take her to the infirmary, she may turn.
It's against policy.
- It's your fault.
You shot her.
- I was defending my people.
I'll do it again.
I know what to do.
- No, no, no, no.
- This is how it has to be.
- No.
Come on.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.
Move aside.
Move aside.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'm allowed this.
All right.
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't.
Let her in.
Nick.
I said let her in.
Nick, this is not how we do things here.
Nick.
Not this time.
Do what your mommy says.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nick, Nick, easy there.
Come on.
Let...
Let me have the pistol, son.
You can't let her die.
If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.
But you got to give me the gun.
Do it, Nick.
Give him the gun.
Get her to the infirmary.
Yes, sir.
Secure her before you treat her.
All right, everybody, that's enough fun.
The show's over.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
Go in there, get yourself looked after.
- Mom, I want to be with you.
- No, I'll find you.
- Mom.
- Please go.
Go.
Oh, God...
You watch where you step.
I'm not well.
I know.
After my first wife left, my two food groups were Jack Daniels and Coke.
Many a bad morning.
If I believed in God, which I don't...
I'd ask where's the cosmic joke?
I get my children.
But Travis...
What, are you here to console me or...?
No, not quite.
Came to find you about something else.
But, yeah.
After someone has this kind of loss... sometimes they take matters into their own hands.
They kill themselves.
Which, in this new age... presents another set of problems.
Part of my job here is to make sure you're not a danger... to yourself or anyone else.
Well, I'd say it's too soon to tell, wouldn't you?
Why were you coming to see me?
Looks like we're missing a Beretta 418 from the fuel truck.
I thought maybe if you borrowed it... you might want to sign for it now.
It's camp policy.
I always thought of that model as more a...
A lady's pistol anyway.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry for your loss, Madison.
I truly am.
Well, he's a good man.
He was a good man.
I'm sure he was... to be with a woman like you.
The handcuffs really necessary?
They are just in case, yeah.
Thank you for bringing her back.
Alicia?
Yeah?
You okay?
Oh-ho.
My style and my color.
Mom?
Close the door.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You asked me if I had a plan, Nick.
Mom, that was before.
- We don't...
- It was the right question.
We're going to stay here.
What?
We're going to make it our home, even if we have to take it over.
Mom... that's insane.
No, it's our fate.
We suffered to get here.
Travis died getting here.
We have to accept it.
We have to be stronger.
Tell me how it happened.
Tell me everything.
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's Okay.
We'll be Okay.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire! -= resync to WEB-DL by Yn1D =-
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, ah...
I think we're going to need your help.
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's Okay, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...
You all right?
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose...
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
Okay, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say! -= resync to WEB-DL by Yn1D =-
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
(CHILDREN SHOUT EXCITEDLY)
(THEY GIGGLE)
(ALARM BELL RINGS)
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's Okay.
We'll be Okay.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
(RUMBLING UNDERGROUND)
(ROBOTIC FOOTSTEPS)
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
(THE MASTER LAUGHS)
(WALTZ PLAYS)
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
BOTH:
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
NARDOLE:
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, ah...
I think we're going to need your help.
(DOOR OPENS)
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
(DOOR CLOSES, LOCKS CLANK)
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
NARDOLE:
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
(DOOR OPENS)
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
CYBERMAN VOICE:
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
(THEY SCREAM)
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
NARDOLE:
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's Okay, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
AS RAZOR:
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children... (HE GASPS IN PAIN)
- (RESONANT WHIRRING)
- You all right?
(WHIRRING INTENSIFIES, STOPS)
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
- (BEEP)
- What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
CYBERMAN VOICE:
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
(ELECTRIC WAIL)
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
(CLANKING FOOTSTEPS)
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose... (EXPLOSION)
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
(EXPLOSION)
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
(WHIRRING)
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
- TARDIS.
- Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
(ELECTRONIC WAIL)
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
(THEY LAUGH)
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
(HE LAUGHS)
Okay, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
(HE GROANS)
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
(HE GROANS)
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
(SHE SOBS)
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
VWORP
(THUD)
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's OK.
We'll be OK.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
*DOCTOR WHO* Season 10 Episode 12 Title: "Doctor Falls"
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but...
I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
There you wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, er...
I think we're going to need your help.
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd... frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's OK, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...
You all right?
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter...
we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose...
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You-You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- Oh!
I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
- TARDIS.
- Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and... kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
OK, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
VWORP
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!

Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
(CHILDREN SHOUT EXCITEDLY)
(THEY GIGGLE)
(ALARM BELL RINGS)
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's OK.
We'll be OK.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!

*DOCTOR WHO* Season 10 Episode 12 Title: "Doctor Falls"
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
(THE MASTER LAUGHS)
(WALTZ PLAYS)
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but...
I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So... (BOTH:) She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
There you wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
(NARDOLE:) Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, er...
I think we're going to need your help.
(DOOR OPENS)
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd... frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
(DOOR CLOSES, LOCKS CLANK)
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
(NARDOLE:) Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
(DOOR OPENS)
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
(CYBERMAN VOICE) That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
(THEY SCREAM)
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
(NARDOLE:) Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's OK, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
(AS RAZOR:) Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children... (HE GASPS IN PAIN)
- (RESONANT WHIRRING)
- You all right?
(WHIRRING INTENSIFIES, STOPS)
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
- (BEEP)
- What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
(CYBERMAN VOICE:) Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter...
we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
(ELECTRIC WAIL)
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
(CLANKING FOOTSTEPS)
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose... (EXPLOSION)
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
(EXPLOSION)
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You-You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- Oh!
I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
(WHIRRING)
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
- TARDIS.
- Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
(ELECTRONIC WAIL)
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and... kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
(THEY LAUGH)
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
(HE LAUGHS)
OK, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
(HE GROANS)
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
(HE GROANS)
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
(SHE SOBS)
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
VWORP
(THUD)
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!
Synchronized by srjanapala
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's Okay.
We'll be Okay.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, ah...
I think we're going to need your help.
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's Okay, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...
You all right?
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose...
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
Okay, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's OK.
We'll be OK.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
_
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, er...
I think we're going to need your help.
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's OK, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...
You all right?
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose...
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
OK, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!
Black hole, 400mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's OK.
We'll be OK.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a biomechanical psychozombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, er...
I think we're going to need your help.
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
No, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodleoo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's OK, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up RoboMop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
Hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...
You all right?
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weaponsgrade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of timedilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose...
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remotespark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Good!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
The way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
They love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
OK, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
(CHILDREN SHOUT EXCITEDLY)
(THEY GIGGLE)
(ALARM BELL RINGS)
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!
It's the scarecrows.
New ones.
It's Okay.
We'll be Okay.
Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
(RUMBLING UNDERGROUND)
(ROBOTIC FOOTSTEPS) -= resync to WEB-DL by Yn1D =-
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
(THE MASTER LAUGHS)
(WALTZ PLAYS)
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.
Hold me!
- Kiss me!
- Make me!
Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.
I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
BOTH:
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?
!
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.
The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?
Exciting, isn't it?
Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.
One to a two.
One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!
Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!
You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.
I'm not begging you.
I'd rather die than beg you!
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.
Is that true?
It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
NARDOLE:
Yeah.
Found this in the loading bay.
Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...
I think I've still got the bump!
Right.
First things first...
Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?
Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.
No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!
Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.
I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, ah...
I think we're going to need your help.
(DOOR OPENS)
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?
I need to...
His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?
!
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.
(DOOR CLOSES, LOCKS CLANK)
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
NARDOLE:
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
(DOOR OPENS)
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
CYBERMAN VOICE:
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.
I gave her a mirror.
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.
Jelly baby?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.
What was that?
In the mirror?
Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!
You know?
I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you... and you're standing on the battlements, saying, "No!
No, not me."
What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...
I'm fine, look at me!
Bill... what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?
!
Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?
!
Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
(THEY SCREAM)
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
NARDOLE:
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's Okay, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?
Engine oil?
No.
It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.
Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
AS RAZOR:
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?
Or, maybe...
I dunno, old bras?
I am not upset.
Oh.
Well, doesn't that take all the fun out of cruelty?
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!
Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children... (HE GASPS IN PAIN)
- (RESONANT WHIRRING)
- You all right?
(WHIRRING INTENSIFIES, STOPS)
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?
- No.
Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?
!
It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got... empathy?
Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
- (BEEP)
- What are you doing?
!
You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
CYBERMAN VOICE:
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.
Kill it.
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?
Why does it look like that?
It evolved.
Exactly.
Since we left, they've built a weapons-grade version to come after us.
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!
It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.
(ELECTRIC WAIL)
Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?
The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.
They're announcing their arrival, they're coming.
The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.
Give me one of them rifles.
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.
We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?
What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct.
Rusted shut.
Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?
Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!
Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!
Very.
I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?
I don't know.
I was sort of found.
On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.
I'll try anything once.
(CLANKING FOOTSTEPS)
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose... (EXPLOSION)
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?
- We're ready.
Is that my gun?
No, no.
I don't like guns.
I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.
I know.
And?
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!
Hey!
I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.
But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?
Have you thought about it?
What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand... is where I fall.
Stand with me.
These people are terrified.
Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?
Take a good, long look at it.
This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.
Missy.
You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.
Sorry.
Just... no.
But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.
No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
(EXPLOSION)
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!
- Boom!
You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.
Three!
Two!
One!
So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.
Because they'll stop tracking the children, which means...
They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.
It means everyone's looking at me.
Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?
No.
There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.
I won't do that until I've left.
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.
Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.
You know what I was like.
If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.
One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.
Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.
She's allowed to explode.
- You sure?
- You know I am.
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?
Quite wrong.
I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
(WHIRRING)
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.
- TARDIS.
- Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?
Are we really going to do this?
I loved being you.
Every second of it.
Oh, the way you burn.
Like a sun.
Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
(ELECTRONIC WAIL)
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?
Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.
Without witness.
Without reward.
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.
You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.
Because it's time to stand with him.
It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.
Never.
Missy!
I will never stand with the Doctor!
Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
(THEY LAUGH)
You see, Missy.
THIS is where we've always been going.
This is our perfect ending.
We shoot ourselves in the back.
(HE LAUGHS)
Okay, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!
Sealed you into your ice tombs!
Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctors... are... not... required.
(HE GROANS)
I'm not a doctor.
I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.
(HE GROANS)
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.
No stars.
I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.
No, I don't think so.
What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!
Hazran says the food's ready.
Right.
Come on.
Let's go and find the others.
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.
I think she likes you.
She's only human.
(SHE SOBS)
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.
It's just a different kind of living.
How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.
And we're not going to.
I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.
I can fly anything!
Even you!
So I'm like you now.
I'm not human any more.
I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met... so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Sontarans!
Perverting the course of human history.
I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
VWORP
(THUD)
Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.
Never again!
I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.
I will not!
No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?
Is someone there?
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
Oh, I don't think so.
No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say! -= resync to WEB-DL by Yn1D =-
[Woman] Dr. Harber, before we're live,
I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
[Woman] The rich history you have with other journalists...
[Harber] I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
Now, don't fuck it up.
[Woman 2] Fifteen seconds.
People trust you...
for decades have valued you.
I think that's because people value the truth.
Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous to share with the world?
Look, this has been my life's work for over 40 years.
There's nothing willy-nilly here.
After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion.
- Which is?
- Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus, how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?
And that discovery...
You proved the existence of an afterlife.
I prefer to call it a new plane of existence.
I can't comment on terminology like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"
but what I can say with scientific certainty is that once the body dies, some part of our consciousness leaves us and travels to a new plane.
Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death.
- Is that...?
- That's correct.
Where do those wavelengths go?
My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.
But you can't tell us what that is exactly.
When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?
It's a tough pill to swallow.
At one point, so was the Earth being round.
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?
Where have you been?
It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.
Yes, you did.
Thank you.
But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.
And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.
Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
Okay.
I wanna ask you the question that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.
Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves?
No.
- That's it?
- That's it.
[Man] Thank you, Dr. Harber...
for my fresh start.
[Woman 1] Andy, no!
Andy!
- Andy!
- [Woman 2] Oh, no.
[Woman 1] Oh, God!
- Why would you do that?
- [Woman 2] Somebody call 911.
[Woman 1] Help!
Some....
Call help, please.
Right now.
Get someone here.
My God!
Why would you do that?
Oh, God.
Turn those cameras off.
[Man] Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.
We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years, with retrospectives all weekend long.
Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has skyrocketed to staggering levels.
Over four million people have taken their lives, attempting to "get there."
As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance since that infamous post-Discovery interview.
Completely off the grid--
[woman] I was listening to that.
I was listening to that.
I'm sorry, I thought-- I thought that I was alone.
It's off-season.
Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island?
Well, you're going there.
[Moans]
Hi.
Hi.
Are you one of those lunatics who just sits next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater?
You look so familiar to me.
It's possible we've met, but you don't have a memorable face.
Okay. [Chuckles]
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I didn't mean that.
I just...
The water.
I'm just a little seasick.
That's weird.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
Um...
- Vertigo.
- I'm not dizzy.
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects.
That's for nausea.
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy?
Fair enough.
Isla.
My name's Isla.
I don't look like an Isla, though.
Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...
- What about you?
- What?
What's your name?
Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.
[Mouths] Will.
What?
I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.
- What's the verdict there?
- I don't know.
It's too early to tell.
You know, Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.
[Chuckles]
You're really something.
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.
They said on the news they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today.
People trying to get there for the anniversary.
I heard something about that.
Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders taking pills on the 50-yard line?
I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups.
It's so... disingenuous, you know?
It just feels so weak.
- You don't believe in the Discovery?
- No, I don't believe in suicide groups.
The Discovery is-- I mean, the proof is overwhelming.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
Proof should be definitive.
So, you don't believe.
I don't believe the way everybody else does.
No, I don't.
- And how's that?
- I'm a neurologist.
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young, found out that she had brain cancer.
Very sad.
She reacted to that diagnosis as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.
It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better.
It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed.
Well, yeah.
Death used to be something we just had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape pain.
That's okay.
That's okay?
Another plane of existence, maybe.
Who knows?
But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes hoping they're gonna grow wings.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
[Car engine revving]
What?
When I was five, I had an accident, and I died for about a minute.
When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something.
Flashes.
A little boy.
Me, maybe, or my brother.
I felt stranded...
Stranded where?
This empty beach.
It doesn't matter.
It was a dream.
It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up.
[Vehicle approaching]
Why would you make all that up?
I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just...
lie.
We lie to ourselves.
You are so annoying.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Yeah, they have.
Ugh.
Thank God we only have a minute left together before we're strangers again.
You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year?
You're crazy.
[Vehicle approaching]
Crazy, but right.
That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in.
[Isla] You'd better work on your math.
Hey!
For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla.
How many of us have you met?
[Isla chuckles] [door closes]
[horn honking]
[country music playing over stereo]
- I got it.
- No, I got it, man.
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.
- What's going on over here?
- Eddie.
- Wait, Eddie Iodice?
Eddie died?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, just to get there.
Just to fucking get there.
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe, downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.
[Chuckles]
Good dude, too.
- Real pity.
- You didn't wanna go to the service?
Go to the...?
I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper
- than go to another fucking funeral.
- Got it.
You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.
When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.
- You're sounding just as paranoid as him.
- [Chuckles]
[Toby] Dad said he needed to change things up.
People knowing our address was too dangerous.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.
Here we are.
Off to see the wizard.
[Will] What the fuck is this place?
Uh, it used to be a summer camp for "troubled youths."
Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids, why would they deserve a fun summer?
You know?
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.
What do you think?
[Will] I think it's completely insane.
Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things.
House what things?
[Toby] These people were all affected by the Discovery.
Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts.
We gave them a home, something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.
Oh, uh, real quick.
Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.
- Yeah, okay.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
Hey, don't worry.
[Beeping] [equipment beeping] [man] This is truly thrilling.
I can only compare it to the model train set you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.
[Woman] Cutting it a little close.
[Toby] Oh, well, you know me.
Pins and needles, needles and pins.
These goddamn machines.
- Who the hell's that?
- His other son just returned.
Surprisingly taller than I remember.
Good to see you again, Cooper.
Will, Lacey.
Lacey...
That went well.
Where's Dad?
- Is he dead?
- No, of course not.
He is now.
- [Lacey] Fifteen seconds.
- Dad?
[Alarm beeping]
Take it easy.
They're just running some tests.
- It's all routine.
- Ten seconds.
Paddles charged... and ready.
[Defibrillator shocks]
See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.
The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.
[Exhales]
- [high-pitched tone] - [muffled chatter] [door opens and closes]
So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.
No.
Kind of.
But you're...
You're looking at this all wrong.
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...
What is it?
Rose-colored glasses.
That's what you're wearing.
Shit-colored glasses.
Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
And we both know you've always been slightly skeptical of everything.
Dad started a cult.
- No.
- Can you not see that?
This is a cult.
All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.
No, no, no.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.
- That's all.
It's not a cult.
- It should be different.
Straitjackets.
You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason.
Right?
Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question.
Welcome back, Will.
[Clears throat]
- [Will groans] - [Harber sighs]
You mind telling me something?
What are you doing back here?
I'm here because I want you to stop it.
I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.
How would I do that?
Say that you were wrong.
Take it all back.
I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.
Who knows better than you?
You were the inspiration for this.
Aren't you curious?
Please, don't say that.
That's not...
- I wasn't.
- Ah, but you were.
Hang on.
"Therefore, it is my belief consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."
- Please don't.
- Hang on.
I'd like to get to this other part.
It gets good.
"Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws that govern our universe."
[Sighs]
- I was wrong.
- You don't believe that.
We were wrong, Dad.
We were wrong because a lot of people died.
And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves... while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.
So, just slamming on the brakes of 40 years' work?
I'd be saying I'm responsible.
Maybe you are.
So, you think I've gone too far?
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.
We opened the door for these people, Will.
They know it's there.
Now we have to show them what's behind it.
[Door closes]
- [high-pitched tone] - [muffled chatter]
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
[Muffled shout]
Isla!
[Will yells]
[Will] Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- What's your problem?
[Groans]
Come on.
Stand up.
Get up.
- [Will] Why are you doing this?
- [Isla] None of your fucking business.
You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this.
You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.
You don't get to just change that!
Ah.
You're not even emotional about dying.
I'm not emotional about anything.
[Toby] I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.
[Will] She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.
[Toby] I still don't know what you want me to do with her.
[Will] You told me that you take in people who need help.
She needs help.
She still can't just stay here.
We have rules.
Then can we make an exception...
in her case, please?
We're talking about somebody's life.
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...
Kill myself again?
You can say it.
I know what happened.
I was there when you ruined it.
She and I have been getting along great.
We still have rules.
She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire.
What's the questionnaire?
- Um...
- Can we be...?
Will, you have a visitor.
Your dad is Thomas Harber?
[Harber] So, nobody but the conductor, which is me, is gonna know your answers.
Everything is completely discreet here.
And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy.
It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land, and then it was space travel.
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.
And now it's exploring what comes after this life.
Seeing what's next.
How old are you?
[Man on recording] You are all part of the same thing.
Cells in a body.
Waves in the ocean.
The soul isn't young or old.
[Harber] Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?
Pass.
I don't know what that means.
There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire.
- Then why do you bother giving it?
- That's a good response.
[Harber] Okay, greatest ability...
and most disappointing weakness.
[Isla] I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.
Understanding who they really are.
[Harber] Weakness?
I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.
If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
- Memory.
- Dig deeper.
- Hidden memory.
- Would you say that you suppress emotions?
I don't really like talking about myself like this.
You don't have to like it.
We think about ourselves every day.
Everything is from our own perspective.
So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts, they're there.
Make no mistake.
They are there.
[Harber] Do you believe in a soul?
If not, close your eyes.
Great.
Let's just say a soul does exist.
Where in the body do you think it'd be?
I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.
[Machine beeps]
[Harber] Wow.
Now, that's interesting.
Most people say the stomach.
But I like that you didn't.
[Harber] Have you ever experienced sudden loss?
Yes.
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone... was the most difficult?
Inanimate objects, maybe?
Like... my coffee table.
I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he--
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.
I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.
[Harber] Okay, last question.
Are you legitimately suicidal?
If you knew what came after...
this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?
Maybe.
Knowing could change things.
How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?
I found our old bed.
Yeah, I see that.
And you should thank me...
by the way, because [grunts]
I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here.
How's Isla?
Oh...
That's actually why I'm here.
Will, she's dead.
No, she's not.
She's not dead.
That was a bad joke.
Um...
But the questionnaire is all wrapped up.
She can stay.
Yeah, good.
She needs to be looked after.
She could try again.
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.
[Sighs]
Because tonight... everything changes.
We finally unveil it.
What is "it," Toby?
Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.
Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?
It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.
I'm not advocating murder.
I'm just pointing out that most people don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own.
[Sighing] Where is he?
It's about to happen.
I can't tell when you're talking to me or that.
It's really annoying.
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there.
At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else, 'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?
Finally, he's here.
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.
We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.
Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.
But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...
And let your subconscious...
take you somewhere else.
I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.
You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type.
Just because somebody doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they can't pray.
What kind of an atheist talks to God?
[Opera music playing over speakers]
Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name?
It wasn't phony.
It was my mother's maiden name.
Where is she?
She's dead.
How did she die?
Because of my dad.
Let us come back into this moment.
I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife.
I can now record where we go.
[Cooper] Please, uh...
get these back to us at your earliest convenience.
And again, these living quarters are just temporary until we can find you a more suitable room.
When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen.
- Glamorous.
- [Chuckles]
I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean, so this should be fine.
Can I have a pen?
Nondisclosure agreement.
Well, considering the sensitivity, it's a fairly standard document.
Could we have the room for a second, please?
[Cooper] You remember that awful week when we slept on the cot by the fridge?
My back sure hasn't forgotten.
- [Will] Hey.
- Mm.
So...
I know that that device is very compelling.
Um...
- Can we talk about it for a second?
- I'm not allowed to talk about it, 'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.
[Snickers] [sighs]
So, your dad's a little weird.
Who cares?
It doesn't make him wrong.
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.
It didn't make him any less a writer.
I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.
Well, what if it did?
How would that change things?
You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.
Hey.
Uh...
I'm sorry.
Were you sleeping?
I'm standing.
Well, yeah.
That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.
Um...
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?
Yeah, sure.
[Sighs] [woman on recording] Those that we have lost are not lost at all...
- [Isla] Where are you guys going?
- It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
...then it's us who are lost.
When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.
Flip it on, flip it off.
But going under, hooked up to the new device, you're not just flipping a light switch.
You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.
So, I'd say that if you go under again... you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.
I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already.
I know you wanted to be first, but if you don't come back, what's the point?
We just go back to the drawing board.
Right?
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...
We need a cadaver.
Okay.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?
I have a corpse idea.
[Rock music playing over earbuds]
- Am I being rude?
- Huh?
- Am I being rude?
- No.
- Care to...
listen?
- Sure.
Crunchy groovy grooves.
Serene nights.
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.
That she killed herself?
Not exactly.
So, she was trying to get there?
No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery.
Huh.
[Bell rings]
Yeah.
[Door buzzes]
How you doing?
In the midst of life, I am in death.
That was weird.
I was just wondering if you could help me out.
My, uh, cousin, Billy... he's gone missing.
And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery, we're all just a little worried.
Really worried.
We got three John Does in this week.
How long has he been missing?
Nope.
No.
No Billy here.
Bummer.
Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier.
Sorry, that was insensitive.
They just got me running rampant here.
I'm doing the job of five people.
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot?
Yeah.
Can I give you a description... of Billy?
That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.
Of course.
Let's go to my office.
[Toby] Hey, so, just curious... [chuckles]
I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.
Aneurysm, that won't work.
It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering.
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.
And then, um... he's got a birthmark on, uh...
Let's see.
On his right elbow.
You're not writing any of this down.
Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so...
But we...
We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body.
Don't you think it's weird how these people were alive a few hours ago?
They had fears and desires, they could exercise?
I don't think it's weird.
I think it's fucking sad.
- Maybe they went someplace better.
- Maybe they went someplace worse.
Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend.
All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.
Shit.
What?
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."
Will... meet Pat Phillips.
Pat Phillips, this is Will.
I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.
Top or bottom?
We could talk, you know.
When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.
Well, you're safe here.
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.
When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit, it had a V etched on it.
I wonder what that stood for.
"Visitor," maybe?
Is that a guess?
That was a pretty good guess.
It's like one of those really obvious answers that only seems obvious after you find out about it.
Were you really smart growing up?
I bet you were.
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.
I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.
Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.
Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."
These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
Sorry, all I heard was something about circles and not fucking me.
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will.
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.
There's not much to tell.
She killed herself.
On their anniversary.
How did she do it?
She made them dinner, and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.
If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?
But he couldn't be bothered.
So, she went upstairs... took a bath instead and, uh...
Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.
And so, you left?
Yeah, I had to.
I couldn't be around it.
I knew.
It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable.
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad.
How do you mean?
Like, being here alive is a waste because...
I don't enjoy it, I'm not happy or grateful... and I'm taking a spot away from someone who maybe would've gotten something more out of it.
Yeah.
I guess I don't think it works that way.
Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about.
Do animals have an afterlife?
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.
What happens to them after they die?
I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.
Do they have their own animal afterlife?
And if they do, is it subdivided by species?
Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife shouldn't practice segregation.
[Will chuckles]
And what happens to a child?
Hold hands till we fall asleep?
This doesn't seem entirely fair.
Shh.
Yeah, okay.
[Speaking indistinctly]
Lacey?
Okay, Toby?
[Machine beeps, then whirs]
Did you hit...?
Hit it again.
[Beeps, then whirs]
Again.
[Beeping and whirring continue]
Hit it again.
I'm hitting it.
Hit it again.
- You're gonna fry the body.
- Toby, hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
[Door closes]
Is this just a setback or...?
I'm really not sure.
[Keypad beeping] [door opens]
[door closes]
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
[Pat] I'm sorry...
I can't.
[Woman] Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing with my body?
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.
We do still have a little time to prep a redo.
Redo?
Guys, come on.
You almost fried the body.
You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early.
All right?
Toby, rustle up a van.
Will's right.
It's good.
Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.
It's where you belong.
- [Sighs] - [door closes]
[inaudible dialogue]
Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
- Okay.
- How'd you end up here?
Why?
I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.
To get there.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
They didn't want me to come.
Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
What's wrong with you?
Oh.
Nothing, I'm just...
I'm processing.
[Groans]
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?
Let's do an experiment.
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm driving.
Okay.
I don't know you very well.
I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.
Shut up.
- You want the head or the feet?
- Head.
Okay.
"Oh, hey, Isla.
What are you up to?"
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.
I'm just...
lugging a corpse through a parking lot."
- Why'd you go with "Jim"?
- Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself,
I can be supportive.
Do we just leave it here?
Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so...
I'm improvising.
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird, but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot.
- That was pretty good.
- Shut up.
Get out.
- I'm saying you're doing a good job.
Fine.
- Stop it.
Sorry.
Yeah, no, bad...
Bad reception on the island.
Um...
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and...
I don't know.
Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.
Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Bye.
- How'd that go?
- It went really well.
Okay.
You're, like, weirdly good at that.
- Oh.
- Here they are.
- [Isla chuckles]
- They're pretty confused.
What do you think they're thinking?
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days.
We're both going to hell.
Yeah.
Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.
I don't know.
Just stupid.
[Sighs] [engine starts]
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
[Pat] I'm sorry...
I can't.
[Woman] Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
[Woman on recording] What if this life is just a dream?
Can I borrow your truck?
Just for...
I have to go get some stuff.
[Woman] As far as our records indicate, we've had 23 patients with the name Phillips on file.
- How accurate are your records?
- Accurate.
I would love to see that list.
Mm.
I'm sure you would.
What the fuck?
Are you looking for something?
Maybe you can help me.
Um...
- Did there used to be a hallway here?
- Used to.
They did a little remodeling.
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?
About a decade ago.
[Electric guitar playing gently]
[Isla] Hey.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
This is, uh...
This is interesting.
Okay, thank you, Toby.
Thank you, my boy.
Well, hello to you all.
As always, it's a pleasure.
When you all first got here, you...
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.
The questionnaire.
And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built.
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.
There's a lot of loose talk going on.
And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus.
Lacey, would you join me, please?
- What's going on?
- It's okay.
Relax.
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?
Um... just over a year.
Just over a year.
You were one of the first.
How have you been treated?
Have you been treated well?
- Have I been good to you?
- You've been wonderful.
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- I've been wonderful.
If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device, and particularly...
why are you saying it failed?
Speak up.
Um...
It's okay.
I just told one person.
It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited.
[Harber] You mean Isla.
You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?
It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked.
Tell everyone where I found you.
Thomas.
It's okay.
This is a safe place.
In the woods.
Go on.
I had a gun.
And where was that gun aimed?
At my chest.
Right next to your heart.
Usually, it's the head...
or the barrel goes into the mouth.
I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before.
I'm sorry.
Please don't lose faith in me.
"Faith."
Oh, God.
I have such contempt for that word.
Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Thomas, please.
Pack up your belongings.
Say your goodbyes.
That was a hell of a show out there.
Come on, Will.
You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?
You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.
It gives them purpose.
And I care about them.
Yeah.
Someone should tell that to Lacey.
You...
You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.
Work, by the way, that we did together.
But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.
- It was always about your mother.
- Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.
Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to.
[Door closes]
[indistinct chatter]
- Hey.
Can I show you something?
- What?
- Just come with me.
Please.
- Sorry.
[Isla] Wait.
- What is this?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.
- You were gonna keep this from me?
- No, I'm...
I'm showing you now.
And I was afraid of what you might do.
All right, so, the afterlife...
This is the afterlife?
How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording?
Then what is it?
My theory is that my father invented something that records memory.
You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.
I understand that you wanted this to be something different.
The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
It should be definitive.
[Beeps]
Where the fuck are we going?
[Will] If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life,
I'm gonna find out exactly when.
Since this hospital opened, there have been 23 patients named Phillips.
But based on the model of his truck,
I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000.
Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names?
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore, so, we can also cross off any Phillips from the past decade.
That leaves us with one.
"Connor Phillips"?
That's him.
That's Pat Phillips' dad.
He died here 13 years ago.
So, it does just record a memory?
[Will] It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh?
With Lacey?
She spoke out of turn.
And she knew the rules.
She basically helped write them.
It's just you and me talking.
You don't believe that.
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.
Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life.
That's what I believe.
Yeah... everybody else's, too.
Dad has no intention... of showing anything the machine records with the outside world.
That's why he lost it when Lacey told people.
If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody, why is he doing it, huh?
What's the point?
"Why is he doing it?"
[Chuckles]
"Why is he doing it?"
Let's see.
Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
I heard that yesterday.
I've been hearing that for the past two years now.
[Toby chuckles]
And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things.
I know Mom died...
Not died.
She killed herself.
She killed herself.
And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
Hmm?
Dad does need... to know.
He needs to know that she made it somewhere.
He overreacted, that's all.
He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.
Dad always comes to his senses.
It's not a memory, Will.
What?
[Isla] On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.
- [Will] How is that possible?
- I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.
It wasn't a lighthouse.
It was waves on his arm.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's not a memory.
This is something else.
If it's not a memory, then what is it?
Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore.
I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone.
We need to find something in this video that still exists.
The...
The woman.
There's a...
Her.
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.
So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.
Will, why are we back here?
I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...
Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
[Sighs]
This is where I saw whatever...
Whatever it is that I saw.
This is the beach.
I used to come here when I was a kid, like...
I was drawn to it.
Or it made me feel better.
Anyway...
Um... when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...
That's why I was here.
What?
I had a son... and he was five years old.
And I fell asleep... just for a second.
And when I woke up, he was gone.
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
But maybe I was wrong.
[Will sighs]
Um, hi.
Is this the Phillips residence?
Connor...
Did you know Connor Phillips?
Pat Phillips?
Can you speak English?
Okay.
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.
Maybe they moved or something.
Should we see if they have the new address?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Can I help you?
I haven't seen my brother in years.
I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me.
Alzheimer's.
She deteriorated after Dad died.
- Connor?
- You knew my father, too?
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.
That he went to see him before he died.
Well, anyway, Dad died and...
Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that.
My husband and I, we own the house now.
Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat?
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying, you don't seem that upset about your brother's death.
[Sighing] Look... it seems as though you liked him.
You found something in him... so, I'm sorry.
But to the rest of us...
he was a piece of shit who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father and a mother who lost every marble she ever had.
I'm sorry.
So... [clears throat] is the last time that you saw Pat when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.
If he told you that, it's a lie.
He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.
This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?
He told you about that?
Well...
When he turned 18, we got matching waves.
We were really close then.
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.
It wasn't a bad theory.
People are just gonna keep killing themselves.
You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad.
I've been thinking a lot about the difference between... what something is and what something means.
And I don't know what any of this is... but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it, it has something to do with not pressing the reset button, even if things get really rough.
We're a bunch of people running around, making the same mistakes over and over.
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else... unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here.
[Isla sighs]
What was your son's name?
Oliver.
I was dreaming.
When he was in the water, I was dreaming.
What about?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't... don't know what about.
I wish I knew.
You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.
[Toby] Will!
Fuck!
Fuck, Will!
Get up.
It's Dad.
What the fuck are you doing?
What about Dad?
- It's dad.
Get the fuck up.
- Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.
He hooked himself up to the device.
He wanted to prove that it works.
- Dad's hooked up right now?
- Yes.
[Isla] We need to tell him that it works.
What?
What works?
- What are you doing?
- He demanded.
- Why aren't you bringing him back?
- He's too far along.
We already know that it records something.
Cooper... it works, okay?
Dad?
Dad?
[Woman] Time to pull yourself away.
Come back to reality.
Come home.
- Is that Mom?
- It's Mom.
[Harber] What I'm doing is reality.
I need to finish.
It's important.
Do you understand?
- Their anniversary.
- Yeah.
[Woman] I'm going upstairs.
[Harber] Now, don't be dramatic.
I'll be done soon.
And we can have dinner.
[Harber] Honey, wait.
Maybe work can wait.
So, what do you say we have some dinner?
She's not taking the bath.
- That's not what happened.
- I know.
We can bring him back.
Cooper, just... wait.
We have to see what happens.
[Cooper] We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late.
Will, come on.
Toby, I'm sorry.
Cooper, now!
- Dad?
Dad, listen to me.
- [Defibrillator shocks]
Dad, please.
Listen to my voice.
- Is he gonna be brain...?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Cooper, hit it again!
[Defibrillator shocks]
Dad?
[Machine beeping]
What happened?
I knew I saw her.
Like a dream that you can't remember.
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.
I never left my study.
Never stopped her on the stairs.
- And she drew a bath.
- [Will] I know.
And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm.
[Harber] I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.
But... what if it's a different plane...
of this existence?
Alternate realities?
No, our reality...
with differences and variations.
Stepping out of a truck...
to visit a dying parent.
Random, like different tattoos.
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.
When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?
A second chance?
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.
In the afterlife, we could change it.
At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out--
We have to destroy the machine.
[Cooper] Hey, Thomas.
Everyone wants to know what's going on.
Welcome, everybody.
Nice to have you all here.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
- Hi.
- Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.
- You got to see your mom again.
- [Harber] I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
And as family...
I think sometimes we get so absorbed with... what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth, we lose the fact that how important family is.
- [Gunshot] - [all gasp]
Lacey?
Lacey.
Lacey, it's okay.
Put the...
Put the gun down.
Lacey, I was wrong.
You do not need to do this.
I didn't kill her.
I just relocated her.
[Will] Isla?
Isla?
Isla.
Oh, it's okay.
Isla?
Dad!
Oh, God.
Dad, please!
I need your help!
[Woman] Somebody go get help.
[Panting] I just wanted my spot back.
Okay.
Okay.
[Will] Isla.
Dad, please help her.
Don't talk.
Just breathe.
I don't wanna die anymore.
[Muffled] You're okay.
I just need you to stay with me.
[Boy] Yeah.
Ha!
[Will mutters]
Isla?
Isla?
[Toby] They were asking, the cops, who to contact for Isla.
- Next-of-kin deal.
- [Harber] I'll have Cooper look into it.
[Toby] Okay.
I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay?
Okay.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
- Maybe I should go in and check on him--
- No, no, no.
Don't.
He needs rest.
He needs to process, okay?
- All right.
- You can check on him after dinner.
And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight.
[Toby] Okay.
But... we haven't come close... to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means.
Like, if it really is another version of our own life, then what happens when we die again?
[Harber] Toby.
- Toby.
- What?
[Harber] We've got to let it go for a while.
We've just got to.
[Grunting]
[Harber] Completely dismantled.
- All traces need to be gone.
- Thomas, I hear you.
[Panting]
[grunts]
[Harber] William?
Let us in, don't do this.
William.
[Machine beeping]
He's on the ferry headed here?
- Not the same here.
- What?
I don't understand.
How are we watching this right now if he's not dead?
[Man on TV] ...since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky--
[Isla] I was watching that.
Isla?
- Isla?
- [Isla] It's off-season.
- Why are you going to this dreary island?
- Isla?
- I have to stop your shooting, Isla.
- Sit down.
I need you to come with me right now.
Sit down, Will.
This is just your memory.
I'm a part of you.
Sit down.
What are we doing back on this ferry?
What the fuck is going on?
You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.
"This life"?
What do you...?
What do you mean, "this life"?
You always start back on the ferry.
[Will] Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
Well, it looks like we're here.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I don't know what I was thinking.
[Isla] The first time, you never got off the ferry.
Then the next day you read that a woman named Isla had drowned herself.
You went on and lived your life, but the thought that you could've done something never left.
It was always there.
[Brakes squeak]
[Isla] And then one day, just like everybody else...
I died.
And then you came back here.
How long have I been stuck living in this loop?
How many times have we met on this ferry?
Your death brings you back here.
You keep coming back over and over again and again.
I don't remember any of it.
I don't remember these other lives.
Nobody can remember them directly.
But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.
[Will] You look so familiar to me.
You look so familiar to me.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
- This is where I saw whatever...
- [Will] This is the beach.
[Toby] How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?
[Will] We're a bunch of people running around making the same mistakes over and over.
And I just don't know why we think it's gonna be different someplace else.
What am I supposed to change?
You already changed it.
You kept coming back until you saved me.
I didn't save you, you died.
There's more than one way to save somebody, Will.
[Harber] Cooper, ready on our end.
We need to bring him back.
How can I hear my dad?
He's in a different place.
Two separate parts in the same place.
[Toby] Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.
No, no, no.
I'm not ready to go back yet.
I need more time with you.
Toby, please wait!
Not yet!
[Cooper] His vitals are concerning me.
If we pull him now, we might lose him.
Isla.
Isla, please.
I'm not ready to leave you.
- What's happening to me?
- You're about to die.
[Cooper] His heart's stopped, Thomas.
Organs are shutting down.
They're trying to bring you back.
That's okay.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
No, not this time.
You don't have to come back anymore.
You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.
When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
I hope so.
[Toby] Dad, everything is shutting down.
His brain's showing barely any activity.
You're leaving now.
This is it.
[Harber] I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.
When I get there...
I'm going to remember you.
[Harber] We've gotta pull him out right now.
One... two... three.
[Monitor flatlines]
[boy chuckles]
Oh, hey.
Look.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey, come here.
Let me help you.
Come here, come here.
Oh!
I got you.
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Boy laughing]
You okay?
- Holy cow.
- Give me that pail.
- You went down pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.
Yep.
You okay?
I got you.
Whoa!
[Grunts]
Where's your mom and dad?
Oliver!
Oliver!
Hi.
It's okay.
He's all right.
He just...
- Okay.
- I told you, you can't--
You can't just run off on me like that, okay?
I've told you.
He was...
He was just...
He's all right.
He was struggling a little bit in the water.
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
He's a good kid.
- You're okay.
- Thanks.
[Will chuckles]
[Isla] You can't do that.
You scared me.
Okay?
Can you walk a little bit?

[playing notes]
Dr. Harber, before we're live,
I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
The rich history you have with other journalists...
I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
Now, don't fuck it up.
Fifteen seconds.
People trust you...
for decades have valued you.
I think that's because people value the truth.
Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous to share with the world?
Look, this has been my life's work for over 40 years.
There's nothing willy-nilly here.
After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion.
- Which is?
- Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus, how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?
And that discovery...
You proved the existence of an afterlife.
I prefer to call it a new plane of existence.
I can't comment on terminology like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"
but what I can say with scientific certainty is that once the body dies, some part of our consciousness leaves us and travels to a new plane.
Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death.
- Is that...?
- That's correct.
Where do those wavelengths go?
My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.
But you can't tell us what that is exactly.
When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?
It's a tough pill to swallow.
At one point, so was the Earth being round.
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?
Where have you been?
It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.
Yes, you did.
Thank you.
But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.
And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.
Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
Okay.
I wanna ask you the question that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.
Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves?
No.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Thank you, Dr. Harber...
for my fresh start.
Andy, no!
Andy!
- Andy!
- Oh, no.
Oh, God!
- Why would you do that?
- Somebody call 911.
Help!
Some....
Call help, please.
Right now.
Get someone here.
My God!
Why would you do that?
Oh, God.
Turn those cameras off.
Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.
We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years, with retrospectives all weekend long.
Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has skyrocketed to staggering levels.
Over four million people have taken their lives, attempting to "get there."
As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance since that infamous post-Discovery interview.
Completely off the grid--
I was listening to that.
I was listening to that.
I'm sorry, I thought-- I thought that I was alone.
It's off-season.
Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island?
Well, you're going there.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you one of those lunatics who just sits next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater?
You look so familiar to me.
It's possible we've met, but you don't have a memorable face.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I didn't mean that.
I just...
The water.
I'm just a little seasick.
That's weird.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
Um...
- Vertigo.
- I'm not dizzy.
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects.
That's for nausea.
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy?
Fair enough.
Isla.
My name's Isla.
I don't look like an Isla, though.
Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...
- What about you?
- What?
What's your name?
Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.
Will.
What?
I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.
- What's the verdict there?
- I don't know.
It's too early to tell.
You know, Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.
You're really something.
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.
They said on the news they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today.
People trying to get there for the anniversary.
I heard something about that.
Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders taking pills on the 50-yard line?
I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups.
It's so... disingenuous, you know?
It just feels so weak.
- You don't believe in the Discovery?
- No, I don't believe in suicide groups.
The Discovery is-- I mean, the proof is overwhelming.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
Proof should be definitive.
So, you don't believe.
I don't believe the way everybody else does.
No, I don't.
- And how's that?
- I'm a neurologist.
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young, found out that she had brain cancer.
Very sad.
She reacted to that diagnosis as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.
It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better.
It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed.
Well, yeah.
Death used to be something we just had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape pain.
That's okay.
That's okay?
Another plane of existence, maybe.
Who knows?
But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes hoping they're gonna grow wings.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
What?
When I was five, I had an accident, and I died for about a minute.
When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something.
Flashes.
A little boy.
Me, maybe, or my brother.
I felt stranded...
Stranded where?
This empty beach.
It doesn't matter.
It was a dream.
It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up.
Why would you make all that up?
I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just...
lie.
We lie to ourselves.
You are so annoying.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Yeah, they have.
Ugh.
Thank God we only have a minute left together before we're strangers again.
You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year?
You're crazy.
Crazy, but right.
That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in.
You'd better work on your math.
Hey!
For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla.
How many of us have you met?
- I got it.
- No, I got it, man.
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.
- What's going on over here?
- Eddie.
- Wait, Eddie Iodice?
Eddie died?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, just to get there.
Just to fucking get there.
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe, downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.
Good dude, too.
- Real pity.
- You didn't wanna go to the service?
Go to the...?
I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper
- than go to another fucking funeral.
- Got it.
You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.
When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.
You're sounding just as paranoid as him.
Dad said he needed to change things up.
People knowing our address was too dangerous.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.
Here we are.
Off to see the wizard.
What the fuck is this place?
Uh, it used to be a summer camp for "troubled youths."
Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids, why would they deserve a fun summer?
You know?
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.
What do you think?
I think it's completely insane.
Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things.
House what things?
These people were all affected by the Discovery.
Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts.
We gave them a home, something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.
Oh, uh, real quick.
Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.
- Yeah, okay.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
Hey, don't worry.
This is truly thrilling.
I can only compare it to the model train set you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.
Cutting it a little close.
Oh, well, you know me.
Pins and needles, needles and pins.
These goddamn machines.
- Who the hell's that?
- His other son just returned.
Surprisingly taller than I remember.
Good to see you again, Cooper.
Will, Lacey.
Lacey...
That went well.
Where's Dad?
- Is he dead?
- No, of course not.
He is now.
- Fifteen seconds.
- Dad?
Take it easy.
They're just running some tests.
- It's all routine.
- Ten seconds.
Paddles charged... and ready.
See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.
The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.
So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.
No.
Kind of.
But you're...
You're looking at this all wrong.
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...
What is it?
Rose-colored glasses.
That's what you're wearing.
Shit-colored glasses.
Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
And we both know you've always been slightly skeptical of everything.
Dad started a cult.
- No.
- Can you not see that?
This is a cult.
All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.
No, no, no.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.
- That's all.
It's not a cult.
- It should be different.
Straitjackets.
You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason.
Right?
Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question.
Welcome back, Will.
You mind telling me something?
What are you doing back here?
I'm here because I want you to stop it.
I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.
How would I do that?
Say that you were wrong.
Take it all back.
I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.
Who knows better than you?
You were the inspiration for this.
Aren't you curious?
Please, don't say that.
That's not...
- I wasn't.
- Ah, but you were.
Hang on.
"Therefore, it is my belief consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."
- Please don't.
- Hang on.
I'd like to get to this other part.
It gets good.
"Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws that govern our universe."
- I was wrong.
- You don't believe that.
We were wrong, Dad.
We were wrong because a lot of people died.
And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves... while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.
So, just slamming on the brakes of 40 years' work?
I'd be saying I'm responsible.
Maybe you are.
So, you think I've gone too far?
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.
We opened the door for these people, Will.
They know it's there.
Now we have to show them what's behind it.
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- What's your problem?
Come on.
Stand up.
Get up.
- Why are you doing this?
- None of your fucking business.
You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this.
You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.
You don't get to just change that!
Ah.
You're not even emotional about dying.
I'm not emotional about anything.
I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.
She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.
I still don't know what you want me to do with her.
You told me that you take in people who need help.
She needs help.
She still can't just stay here.
We have rules.
Then can we make an exception...
in her case, please?
We're talking about somebody's life.
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...
Kill myself again?
You can say it.
I know what happened.
I was there when you ruined it.
She and I have been getting along great.
We still have rules.
She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire.
What's the questionnaire?
- Um...
- Can we be...?
Will, you have a visitor.
Your dad is Thomas Harber?
So, nobody but the conductor, which is me, is gonna know your answers.
Everything is completely discreet here.
And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy.
It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land, and then it was space travel.
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.
And now it's exploring what comes after this life.
Seeing what's next.
How old are you?
You are all part of the same thing.
Cells in a body.
Waves in the ocean.
The soul isn't young or old.
Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?
Pass.
I don't know what that means.
There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire.
- Then why do you bother giving it?
- That's a good response.
Okay, greatest ability...
and most disappointing weakness.
I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.
Understanding who they really are.
Weakness?
I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.
If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
- Memory.
- Dig deeper.
- Hidden memory.
- Would you say that you suppress emotions?
I don't really like talking about myself like this.
You don't have to like it.
We think about ourselves every day.
Everything is from our own perspective.
So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts, they're there.
Make no mistake.
They are there.
Do you believe in a soul?
If not, close your eyes.
Great.
Let's just say a soul does exist.
Where in the body do you think it'd be?
I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.
Wow.
Now, that's interesting.
Most people say the stomach.
But I like that you didn't.
Have you ever experienced sudden loss?
Yes.
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone... was the most difficult?
Inanimate objects, maybe?
Like... my coffee table.
I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he--
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.
I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.
Okay, last question.
Are you legitimately suicidal?
If you knew what came after...
this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?
Maybe.
Knowing could change things.
How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?
I found our old bed.
Yeah, I see that.
And you should thank me...
by the way, because
I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here.
How's Isla?
Oh...
That's actually why I'm here.
Will, she's dead.
No, she's not.
She's not dead.
That was a bad joke.
Um...
But the questionnaire is all wrapped up.
She can stay.
Yeah, good.
She needs to be looked after.
She could try again.
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.
Because tonight... everything changes.
We finally unveil it.
What is "it," Toby?
Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.
Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?
It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.
I'm not advocating murder.
I'm just pointing out that most people don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own.
Where is he?
It's about to happen.
I can't tell when you're talking to me or that.
It's really annoying.
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there.
At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else, 'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?
Finally, he's here.
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.
We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.
Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.
But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...
And let your subconscious...
take you somewhere else.
I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.
You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type.
Just because somebody doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they can't pray.
What kind of an atheist talks to God?
Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name?
It wasn't phony.
It was my mother's maiden name.
Where is she?
She's dead.
How did she die?
Because of my dad.
Let us come back into this moment.
I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife.
I can now record where we go.
Please, uh...
get these back to us at your earliest convenience.
And again, these living quarters are just temporary until we can find you a more suitable room.
When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen.
Glamorous.
I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean, so this should be fine.
Can I have a pen?
Nondisclosure agreement.
Well, considering the sensitivity, it's a fairly standard document.
Could we have the room for a second, please?
You remember that awful week when we slept on the cot by the fridge?
My back sure hasn't forgotten.
- Hey.
- Mm.
So...
I know that that device is very compelling.
Um...
- Can we talk about it for a second?
- I'm not allowed to talk about it, 'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.
So, your dad's a little weird.
Who cares?
It doesn't make him wrong.
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.
It didn't make him any less a writer.
I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.
Well, what if it did?
How would that change things?
You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.
Hey.
Uh...
I'm sorry.
Were you sleeping?
I'm standing.
Well, yeah.
That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.
Um...
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?
Yeah, sure.
Those that we have lost are not lost at all...
- Where are you guys going?
- It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
...then it's us who are lost.
When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.
Flip it on, flip it off.
But going under, hooked up to the new device, you're not just flipping a light switch.
You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.
So, I'd say that if you go under again... you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.
I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already.
I know you wanted to be first, but if you don't come back, what's the point?
We just go back to the drawing board.
Right?
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...
We need a cadaver.
Okay.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?
I have a corpse idea.
- Am I being rude?
- Huh?
- Am I being rude?
- No.
- Care to...
listen?
- Sure.
Crunchy groovy grooves.
Serene nights.
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.
That she killed herself?
Not exactly.
So, she was trying to get there?
No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery.
Huh.
Yeah.
How you doing?
In the midst of life, I am in death.
That was weird.
I was just wondering if you could help me out.
My, uh, cousin, Billy... he's gone missing.
And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery, we're all just a little worried.
Really worried.
We got three John Does in this week.
How long has he been missing?
Nope.
No.
No Billy here.
Bummer.
Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier.
Sorry, that was insensitive.
They just got me running rampant here.
I'm doing the job of five people.
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot?
Yeah.
Can I give you a description... of Billy?
That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.
Of course.
Let's go to my office.
Hey, so, just curious...
I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.
Aneurysm, that won't work.
It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering.
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.
And then, um... he's got a birthmark on, uh...
Let's see.
On his right elbow.
You're not writing any of this down.
Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so...
But we...
We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body.
Don't you think it's weird how these people were alive a few hours ago?
They had fears and desires, they could exercise?
I don't think it's weird.
I think it's fucking sad.
- Maybe they went someplace better.
- Maybe they went someplace worse.
Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend.
All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.
Shit.
What?
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."
Will... meet Pat Phillips.
Pat Phillips, this is Will.
I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.
Top or bottom?
We could talk, you know.
When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.
Well, you're safe here.
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.
When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit, it had a V etched on it.
I wonder what that stood for.
"Visitor," maybe?
Is that a guess?
That was a pretty good guess.
It's like one of those really obvious answers that only seems obvious after you find out about it.
Were you really smart growing up?
I bet you were.
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.
I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.
Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.
Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."
These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
Sorry, all I heard was something about circles and not fucking me.
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will.
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.
There's not much to tell.
She killed herself.
On their anniversary.
How did she do it?
She made them dinner, and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.
If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?
But he couldn't be bothered.
So, she went upstairs... took a bath instead and, uh...
Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.
And so, you left?
Yeah, I had to.
I couldn't be around it.
I knew.
It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable.
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad.
How do you mean?
Like, being here alive is a waste because...
I don't enjoy it, I'm not happy or grateful... and I'm taking a spot away from someone who maybe would've gotten something more out of it.
Yeah.
I guess I don't think it works that way.
Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about.
Do animals have an afterlife?
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.
What happens to them after they die?
I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.
Do they have their own animal afterlife?
And if they do, is it subdivided by species?
Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife shouldn't practice segregation.
And what happens to a child?
Hold hands till we fall asleep?
This doesn't seem entirely fair.
Shh.
Yeah, okay.
Lacey?
Okay, Toby?
Did you hit...?
Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
I'm hitting it.
Hit it again.
- You're gonna fry the body.
- Toby, hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Is this just a setback or...?
I'm really not sure.
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
I'm sorry...
I can't.
Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing with my body?
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.
We do still have a little time to prep a redo.
Redo?
Guys, come on.
You almost fried the body.
You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early.
All right?
Toby, rustle up a van.
Will's right.
It's good.
Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.
It's where you belong.
Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
- Okay.
- How'd you end up here?
Why?
I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.
To get there.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
They didn't want me to come.
Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
What's wrong with you?
Oh.
Nothing, I'm just...
I'm processing.
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?
Let's do an experiment.
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm driving.
Okay.
I don't know you very well.
I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.
Shut up.
- You want the head or the feet?
- Head.
Okay.
"Oh, hey, Isla.
What are you up to?"
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.
I'm just...
lugging a corpse through a parking lot."
- Why'd you go with "Jim"?
- Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself,
I can be supportive.
Do we just leave it here?
Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so...
I'm improvising.
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird, but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot.
- That was pretty good.
- Shut up.
Get out.
- I'm saying you're doing a good job.
Fine.
- Stop it.
Sorry.
Yeah, no, bad...
Bad reception on the island.
Um...
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and...
I don't know.
Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.
Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Bye.
- How'd that go?
- It went really well.
Okay.
You're, like, weirdly good at that.
- Oh.
- Here they are.
They're pretty confused.
What do you think they're thinking?
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days.
We're both going to hell.
Yeah.
Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.
I don't know.
Just stupid.
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
I'm sorry...
I can't.
Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
What if this life is just a dream?
Can I borrow your truck?
Just for...
I have to go get some stuff.
As far as our records indicate, we've had 23 patients with the name Phillips on file.
- How accurate are your records?
- Accurate.
I would love to see that list.
Mm.
I'm sure you would.
What the fuck?
Are you looking for something?
Maybe you can help me.
Um...
- Did there used to be a hallway here?
- Used to.
They did a little remodeling.
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?
About a decade ago.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
This is, uh...
This is interesting.
Okay, thank you, Toby.
Thank you, my boy.
Well, hello to you all.
As always, it's a pleasure.
When you all first got here, you...
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.
The questionnaire.
And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built.
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.
There's a lot of loose talk going on.
And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus.
Lacey, would you join me, please?
- What's going on?
- It's okay.
Relax.
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?
Um... just over a year.
Just over a year.
You were one of the first.
How have you been treated?
Have you been treated well?
- Have I been good to you?
- You've been wonderful.
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- I've been wonderful.
If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device, and particularly...
why are you saying it failed?
Speak up.
Um...
It's okay.
I just told one person.
It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited.
You mean Isla.
You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?
It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked.
Tell everyone where I found you.
Thomas.
It's okay.
This is a safe place.
In the woods.
Go on.
I had a gun.
And where was that gun aimed?
At my chest.
Right next to your heart.
Usually, it's the head...
or the barrel goes into the mouth.
I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before.
I'm sorry.
Please don't lose faith in me.
"Faith."
Oh, God.
I have such contempt for that word.
Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Thomas, please.
Pack up your belongings.
Say your goodbyes.
That was a hell of a show out there.
Come on, Will.
You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?
You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.
It gives them purpose.
And I care about them.
Yeah.
Someone should tell that to Lacey.
You...
You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.
Work, by the way, that we did together.
But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.
- It was always about your mother.
- Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.
Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to.
- Hey.
Can I show you something?
- What?
- Just come with me.
Please.
- Sorry.
Wait.
- What is this?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.
- You were gonna keep this from me?
- No, I'm...
I'm showing you now.
And I was afraid of what you might do.
All right, so, the afterlife...
This is the afterlife?
How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording?
Then what is it?
My theory is that my father invented something that records memory.
You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.
I understand that you wanted this to be something different.
The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
It should be definitive.
Where the fuck are we going?
If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life,
I'm gonna find out exactly when.
Since this hospital opened, there have been 23 patients named Phillips.
But based on the model of his truck,
I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000.
Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names?
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore, so, we can also cross off any Phillips from the past decade.
That leaves us with one.
"Connor Phillips"?
That's him.
That's Pat Phillips' dad.
He died here 13 years ago.
So, it does just record a memory?
It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh?
With Lacey?
She spoke out of turn.
And she knew the rules.
She basically helped write them.
It's just you and me talking.
You don't believe that.
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.
Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life.
That's what I believe.
Yeah... everybody else's, too.
Dad has no intention... of showing anything the machine records with the outside world.
That's why he lost it when Lacey told people.
If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody, why is he doing it, huh?
What's the point?
"Why is he doing it?"
"Why is he doing it?"
Let's see.
Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
I heard that yesterday.
I've been hearing that for the past two years now.
And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things.
I know Mom died...
Not died.
She killed herself.
She killed herself.
And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
Hmm?
Dad does need... to know.
He needs to know that she made it somewhere.
He overreacted, that's all.
He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.
Dad always comes to his senses.
It's not a memory, Will.
What?
On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.
- How is that possible?
- I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.
It wasn't a lighthouse.
It was waves on his arm.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's not a memory.
This is something else.
If it's not a memory, then what is it?
Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore.
I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone.
We need to find something in this video that still exists.
The...
The woman.
There's a...
Her.
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.
So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.
Will, why are we back here?
I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...
Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
This is where I saw whatever...
Whatever it is that I saw.
This is the beach.
I used to come here when I was a kid, like...
I was drawn to it.
Or it made me feel better.
Anyway...
Um... when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...
That's why I was here.
What?
I had a son... and he was five years old.
And I fell asleep... just for a second.
And when I woke up, he was gone.
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
But maybe I was wrong.
Um, hi.
Is this the Phillips residence?
Connor...
Did you know Connor Phillips?
Pat Phillips?
Can you speak English?
Okay.
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.
Maybe they moved or something.
Should we see if they have the new address?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Can I help you?
I haven't seen my brother in years.
I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me.
Alzheimer's.
She deteriorated after Dad died.
- Connor?
- You knew my father, too?
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.
That he went to see him before he died.
Well, anyway, Dad died and...
Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that.
My husband and I, we own the house now.
Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat?
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying, you don't seem that upset about your brother's death.
Look... it seems as though you liked him.
You found something in him... so, I'm sorry.
But to the rest of us...
he was a piece of shit who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father and a mother who lost every marble she ever had.
I'm sorry.
So...
is the last time that you saw Pat when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.
If he told you that, it's a lie.
He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.
This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?
He told you about that?
Well...
When he turned 18, we got matching waves.
We were really close then.
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.
It wasn't a bad theory.
People are just gonna keep killing themselves.
You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad.
I've been thinking a lot about the difference between... what something is and what something means.
And I don't know what any of this is... but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it, it has something to do with not pressing the reset button, even if things get really rough.
We're a bunch of people running around, making the same mistakes over and over.
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else... unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here.
What was your son's name?
Oliver.
I was dreaming.
When he was in the water, I was dreaming.
What about?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't... don't know what about.
I wish I knew.
You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.
Will!
Fuck!
Fuck, Will!
Get up.
It's Dad.
What the fuck are you doing?
What about Dad?
- It's dad.
Get the fuck up.
- Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.
He hooked himself up to the device.
He wanted to prove that it works.
- Dad's hooked up right now?
- Yes.
We need to tell him that it works.
What?
What works?
- What are you doing?
- He demanded.
- Why aren't you bringing him back?
- He's too far along.
We already know that it records something.
Cooper... it works, okay?
Dad?
Dad?
Time to pull yourself away.
Come back to reality.
Come home.
- Is that Mom?
- It's Mom.
What I'm doing is reality.
I need to finish.
It's important.
Do you understand?
- Their anniversary.
- Yeah.
I'm going upstairs.
Now, don't be dramatic.
I'll be done soon.
And we can have dinner.
Honey, wait.
Maybe work can wait.
So, what do you say we have some dinner?
She's not taking the bath.
- That's not what happened.
- I know.
We can bring him back.
Cooper, just... wait.
We have to see what happens.
We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late.
Will, come on.
Toby, I'm sorry.
Cooper, now!
Dad?
Dad, listen to me.
Dad, please.
Listen to my voice.
- Is he gonna be brain...?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Cooper, hit it again!
Dad?
What happened?
I knew I saw her.
Like a dream that you can't remember.
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.
I never left my study.
Never stopped her on the stairs.
- And she drew a bath.
- I know.
And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm.
I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.
But... what if it's a different plane...
of this existence?
Alternate realities?
No, our reality...
with differences and variations.
Stepping out of a truck...
to visit a dying parent.
Random, like different tattoos.
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.
When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?
A second chance?
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.
In the afterlife, we could change it.
At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out--
We have to destroy the machine.
Hey, Thomas.
Everyone wants to know what's going on.
Welcome, everybody.
Nice to have you all here.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
- Hi.
- Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.
- You got to see your mom again.
- I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
And as family...
I think sometimes we get so absorbed with... what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth, we lose the fact that how important family is.
Lacey?
Lacey.
Lacey, it's okay.
Put the...
Put the gun down.
Lacey, I was wrong.
You do not need to do this.
I didn't kill her.
I just relocated her.
Isla?
Isla?
Isla.
Oh, it's okay.
Isla?
Dad!
Oh, God.
Dad, please!
I need your help!
Somebody go get help.
I just wanted my spot back.
Okay.
Okay.
Isla.
Dad, please help her.
Don't talk.
Just breathe.
I don't wanna die anymore.
You're okay.
I just need you to stay with me.
Yeah.
Ha!
Isla?
Isla?
They were asking, the cops, who to contact for Isla.
- Next-of-kin deal.
- I'll have Cooper look into it.
Okay.
I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay?
Okay.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
- Maybe I should go in and check on him--
- No, no, no.
Don't.
He needs rest.
He needs to process, okay?
- All right.
- You can check on him after dinner.
And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight.
Okay.
But... we haven't come close... to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means.
Like, if it really is another version of our own life, then what happens when we die again?
Toby.
- Toby.
- What?
We've got to let it go for a while.
We've just got to.
Completely dismantled.
- All traces need to be gone.
- Thomas, I hear you.
William?
Let us in, don't do this.
William.
He's on the ferry headed here?
- Not the same here.
- What?
I don't understand.
How are we watching this right now if he's not dead?
...since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky--
I was watching that.
Isla?
- Isla?
- It's off-season.
- Why are you going to this dreary island?
- Isla?
- I have to stop your shooting, Isla.
- Sit down.
I need you to come with me right now.
Sit down, Will.
This is just your memory.
I'm a part of you.
Sit down.
What are we doing back on this ferry?
What the fuck is going on?
You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.
"This life"?
What do you...?
What do you mean, "this life"?
You always start back on the ferry.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
Well, it looks like we're here.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I don't know what I was thinking.
The first time, you never got off the ferry.
Then the next day you read that a woman named Isla had drowned herself.
You went on and lived your life, but the thought that you could've done something never left.
It was always there.
And then one day, just like everybody else...
I died.
And then you came back here.
How long have I been stuck living in this loop?
How many times have we met on this ferry?
Your death brings you back here.
You keep coming back over and over again and again.
I don't remember any of it.
I don't remember these other lives.
Nobody can remember them directly.
But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.
You look so familiar to me.
You look so familiar to me.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
- This is where I saw whatever...
- This is the beach.
How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?
We're a bunch of people running around making the same mistakes over and over.
And I just don't know why we think it's gonna be different someplace else.
What am I supposed to change?
You already changed it.
You kept coming back until you saved me.
I didn't save you, you died.
There's more than one way to save somebody, Will.
Cooper, ready on our end.
We need to bring him back.
How can I hear my dad?
He's in a different place.
Two separate parts in the same place.
Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.
No, no, no.
I'm not ready to go back yet.
I need more time with you.
Toby, please wait!
Not yet!
His vitals are concerning me.
If we pull him now, we might lose him.
Isla.
Isla, please.
I'm not ready to leave you.
- What's happening to me?
- You're about to die.
His heart's stopped, Thomas.
Organs are shutting down.
They're trying to bring you back.
That's okay.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
No, not this time.
You don't have to come back anymore.
You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.
When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
I hope so.
Dad, everything is shutting down.
His brain's showing barely any activity.
You're leaving now.
This is it.
I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.
When I get there...
I'm going to remember you.
We've gotta pull him out right now.
One... two... three.
Oh, hey.
Look.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey, come here.
Let me help you.
Come here, come here.
Oh!
I got you.
Whoa!
Whoa!
You okay?
- Holy cow.
- Give me that pail.
- You went down pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.
Yep.
You okay?
I got you.
Whoa!
Where's your mom and dad?
Oliver!
Oliver!
Hi.
It's okay.
He's all right.
He just...
- Okay.
- I told you, you can't--
You can't just run off on me like that, okay?
I've told you.
He was...
He was just...
He's all right.
He was struggling a little bit in the water.
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
He's a good kid.
- You're okay.
- Thanks.
You can't do that.
You scared me.
Okay?
Can you walk a little bit?

Dr. Harber, before we're live,
I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
The rich history you have with other journalists...
I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
Now, don't fuck it up.
Fifteen seconds.
People trust you...
for decades have valued you.
I think that's because people value the truth.
Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous to share with the world?
Look, this has been my life's work for over 40 years.
There's nothing willy-nilly here.
After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion.
- Which is?
- Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus, how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?
And that discovery...
You proved the existence of an afterlife.
I prefer to call it a new plane of existence.
I can't comment on terminology like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"
but what I can say with scientific certainty is that once the body dies, some part of our consciousness leaves us and travels to a new plane.
Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death.
- Is that...?
- That's correct.
Where do those wavelengths go?
My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.
But you can't tell us what that is exactly.
When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?
It's a tough pill to swallow.
At one point, so was the Earth being round.
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?
Where have you been?
It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.
Yes, you did.
Thank you.
But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.
And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.
Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
Okay.
I wanna ask you the question that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.
Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves?
No.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Thank you, Dr. Harber...
for my fresh start.
Andy, no!
Andy!
- Andy!
- Oh, no.
Oh, God!
- Why would you do that?
- Somebody call 911.
Help!
Some....
Call help, please.
Right now.
Get someone here.
My God!
Why would you do that?
Oh, God.
Turn those cameras off.
Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.
We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years, with retrospectives all weekend long.
Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has skyrocketed to staggering levels.
Over four million people have taken their lives, attempting to "get there."
As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance since that infamous post-Discovery interview.
Completely off the grid...
I was listening to that.
I'm sorry, I thought...
I thought that I was alone.
It's off-season.
Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island?
Well, you're going there.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you one of those lunatics who just sits next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater?
You look so familiar to me.
It's possible we've met, but you don't have a memorable face.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I didn't mean that.
I just...
The water.
I'm just a little seasick.
That's weird.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
Um...
- Vertigo.
- I'm not dizzy.
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects.
That's for nausea.
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy?
Fair enough.
Isla.
My name's Isla.
I don't look like an Isla, though.
Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...
- What about you?
- What?
What's your name?
Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.
Will.
What?
I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.
- What's the verdict there?
- I don't know.
It's too early to tell.
You know, Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.
You're really something.
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.
They said on the news they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today.
People trying to get there for the anniversary.
I heard something about that.
Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders taking pills on the 50-yard line?
I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups.
It's so... disingenuous, you know?
It just feels so weak.
- You don't believe in the Discovery?
- No, I don't believe in suicide groups.
The Discovery is...
I mean, the proof is overwhelming.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
Proof should be definitive.
So, you don't believe.
I don't believe the way everybody else does.
No, I don't.
- And how's that?
- I'm a neurologist.
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young, found out that she had brain cancer.
Very sad.
She reacted to that diagnosis as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.
It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better.
It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed.
Well, yeah.
Death used to be something we just had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape pain.
That's okay.
That's okay?
Another plane of existence, maybe.
Who knows?
But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes hoping they're gonna grow wings.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
What?
When I was five, I had an accident, and I died for about a minute.
When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something.
Flashes.
A little boy.
Me, maybe, or my brother.
I felt stranded...
Stranded where?
This empty beach.
It doesn't matter.
It was a dream.
It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up.
Why would you make all that up?
I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just...
lie.
We lie to ourselves.
You are so annoying.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Yeah, they have.
Ugh.
Thank God we only have a minute left together before we're strangers again.
You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year?
You're crazy.
Crazy, but right.
That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in.
You'd better work on your math.
Hey!
For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla.
How many of us have you met?
- I got it.
- No, I got it, man.
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.
- What's going on over here?
- Eddie.
- Wait, Eddie Iodice?
Eddie died?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, just to get there.
Just to fucking get there.
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe, downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.
Good dude, too.
- Real pity.
- You didn't wanna go to the service?
Go to the...?
I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper
- than go to another fucking funeral.
- Got it.
You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.
When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.
You're sounding just as paranoid as him.
Dad said he needed to change things up.
People knowing our address was too dangerous.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.
Here we are.
Off to see the wizard.
What the fuck is this place?
Uh, it used to be a summer camp for "troubled youths."
Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids, why would they deserve a fun summer?
You know?
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.
What do you think?
I think it's completely insane.
Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things.
House what things?
These people were all affected by the Discovery.
Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts.
We gave them a home, something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.
Oh, uh, real quick.
Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.
- Yeah, okay.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
Hey, don't worry.
This is truly thrilling.
I can only compare it to the model train set you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.
Cutting it a little close.
Oh, well, you know me.
Pins and needles, needles and pins.
These goddamn machines.
- Who the hell's that?
- His other son just returned.
Surprisingly taller than I remember.
Good to see you again, Cooper.
Will, Lacey.
Lacey...
That went well.
Where's Dad?
- Is he dead?
- No, of course not.
He is now.
- Fifteen seconds.
- Dad?
Take it easy.
They're just running some tests.
- It's all routine.
- Ten seconds.
Paddles charged... and ready.
See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.
The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.
So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.
No.
Kind of.
But you're...
You're looking at this all wrong.
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...
What is it?
Rose-colored glasses.
That's what you're wearing.
Shit-colored glasses.
Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
And we both know you've always been slightly skeptical of everything.
Dad started a cult.
- No.
- Can you not see that?
This is a cult.
All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.
No, no, no.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.
- That's all.
It's not a cult.
- It should be different.
Straitjackets.
You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason.
Right?
Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question.
Welcome back, Will.
You mind telling me something?
What are you doing back here?
I'm here because I want you to stop it.
I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.
How would I do that?
Say that you were wrong.
Take it all back.
I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.
Who knows better than you?
You were the inspiration for this.
Aren't you curious?
Please, don't say that.
That's not...
- I wasn't.
- Ah, but you were.
Hang on.
"Therefore, it is my belief consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."
- Please don't.
- Hang on.
I'd like to get to this other part.
It gets good.
"Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws that govern our universe."
- I was wrong.
- You don't believe that.
We were wrong, Dad.
We were wrong because a lot of people died.
And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves... while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.
So, just slamming on the brakes of 40 years' work?
I'd be saying I'm responsible.
Maybe you are.
So, you think I've gone too far?
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.
We opened the door for these people, Will.
They know it's there.
Now we have to show them what's behind it.
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
Oh, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- What's your problem?
Come on.
Stand up.
Get up.
- Why are you doing this?
- None of your fucking business.
You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this.
You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.
You don't get to just change that!
Ah.
You're not even emotional about dying.
I'm not emotional about anything.
I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.
She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.
I still don't know what you want me to do with her.
You told me that you take in people who need help.
She needs help.
She still can't just stay here.
We have rules.
Then can we make an exception...
in her case, please?
We're talking about somebody's life.
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...
Kill myself again?
You can say it.
I know what happened.
I was there when you ruined it.
She and I have been getting along great.
We still have rules.
She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire.
What's the questionnaire?
- Um...
- Can we be...?
Will, you have a visitor.
Your dad is Thomas Harber?
So, nobody but the conductor, which is me, is gonna know your answers.
Everything is completely discreet here.
And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy.
It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land, and then it was space travel.
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.
And now it's exploring what comes after this life.
Seeing what's next.
How old are you?
You are all part of the same thing.
Cells in a body.
Waves in the ocean.
The soul isn't young or old.
Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?
Pass.
I don't know what that means.
There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire.
- Then why do you bother giving it?
- That's a good response.
Okay, greatest ability...
and most disappointing weakness.
I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.
Understanding who they really are.
Weakness?
I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.
If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
- Memory.
- Dig deeper.
- Hidden memory.
- Would you say that you suppress emotions?
I don't really like talking about myself like this.
You don't have to like it.
We think about ourselves every day.
Everything is from our own perspective.
So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts, they're there.
Make no mistake.
They are there.
Do you believe in a soul?
If not, close your eyes.
Great.
Let's just say a soul does exist.
Where in the body do you think it'd be?
I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.
Wow.
Now, that's interesting.
Most people say the stomach.
But I like that you didn't.
Have you ever experienced sudden loss?
Yes.
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone... was the most difficult?
Inanimate objects, maybe?
Like... my coffee table.
I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he...
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.
I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.
Okay, last question.
Are you legitimately suicidal?
If you knew what came after...
this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?
Maybe.
Knowing could change things.
How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?
I found our old bed.
Yeah, I see that.
And you should thank me...
by the way, because
I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here.
How's Isla?
Oh...
That's actually why I'm here.
Will, she's dead.
No, she's not.
She's not dead.
That was a bad joke.
Um...
But the questionnaire is all wrapped up.
She can stay.
Yeah, good.
She needs to be looked after.
She could try again.
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.
Because tonight... everything changes.
We finally unveil it.
What is "it," Toby?
Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.
Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?
It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.
I'm not advocating murder.
I'm just pointing out that most people don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own.
Where is he?
It's about to happen.
I can't tell when you're talking to me or that.
It's really annoying.
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there.
At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else, 'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?
Finally, he's here.
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.
We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.
Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.
But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...
And let your subconscious...
take you somewhere else.
I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.
You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type.
Just because somebody doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they can't pray.
What kind of an atheist talks to God?
Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name?
It wasn't phony.
It was my mother's maiden name.
Where is she?
She's dead.
How did she die?
Because of my dad.
Let us come back into this moment.
I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife.
I can now record where we go.
Please, uh...
get these back to us at your earliest convenience.
And again, these living quarters are just temporary until we can find you a more suitable room.
When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen.
Glamorous.
I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean, so this should be fine.
Can I have a pen?
Nondisclosure agreement.
Well, considering the sensitivity, it's a fairly standard document.
Could we have the room for a second, please?
You remember that awful week when we slept on the cot by the fridge?
My back sure hasn't forgotten.
- Hey.
- Mm.
So...
I know that that device is very compelling.
Um...
- Can we talk about it for a second?
- I'm not allowed to talk about it, 'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.
So, your dad's a little weird.
Who cares?
It doesn't make him wrong.
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.
It didn't make him any less a writer.
I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.
Well, what if it did?
How would that change things?
You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.
Hey.
Uh...
I'm sorry.
Were you sleeping?
I'm standing.
Well, yeah.
That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.
Um...
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?
Yeah, sure.
Those that we have lost are not lost at all...
- Where are you guys going?
- It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
then it's us who are lost.
When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.
Flip it on, flip it off.
But going under, hooked up to the new device, you're not just flipping a light switch.
You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.
So, I'd say that if you go under again... you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.
I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already.
I know you wanted to be first, but if you don't come back, what's the point?
We just go back to the drawing board.
Right?
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...
We need a cadaver.
Okay.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?
I have a corpse idea.
- Am I being rude?
- Huh?
- Am I being rude?
- No.
- Care to...
listen?
- Sure.
Crunchy groovy grooves.
Serene nights.
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.
That she killed herself?
Not exactly.
So, she was trying to get there?
No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery.
Huh.
Yeah.
How you doing?
In the midst of life, I am in death.
That was weird.
I was just wondering if you could help me out.
My, uh, cousin, Billy... he's gone missing.
And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery, we're all just a little worried.
Really worried.
We got three John Does in this week.
How long has he been missing?
Nope.
No.
No Billy here.
Bummer.
Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier.
Sorry, that was insensitive.
They just got me running rampant here.
I'm doing the job of five people.
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot?
Yeah.
Can I give you a description... of Billy?
That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.
Of course.
Let's go to my office.
Hey, so, just curious...
I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.
Aneurysm, that won't work.
It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering.
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.
And then, um... he's got a birthmark on, uh...
Let's see.
On his right elbow.
You're not writing any of this down.
Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so...
But we...
We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body.
Don't you think it's weird how these people were alive a few hours ago?
They had fears and desires, they could exercise?
I don't think it's weird.
I think it's fucking sad.
- Maybe they went someplace better.
- Maybe they went someplace worse.
Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend.
All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.
Shit.
What?
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."
Will... meet Pat Phillips.
Pat Phillips, this is Will.
I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.
Top or bottom?
We could talk, you know.
When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.
Well, you're safe here.
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.
When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit, it had a V etched on it.
I wonder what that stood for.
"Visitor," maybe?
Is that a guess?
That was a pretty good guess.
It's like one of those really obvious answers that only seems obvious after you find out about it.
Were you really smart growing up?
I bet you were.
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.
I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.
Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.
Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."
These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
Sorry, all I heard was something about circles and not fucking me.
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will.
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.
There's not much to tell.
She killed herself.
On their anniversary.
How did she do it?
She made them dinner, and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.
If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?
But he couldn't be bothered.
So, she went upstairs... took a bath instead and, uh...
Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.
And so, you left?
Yeah, I had to.
I couldn't be around it.
I knew.
It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable.
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad.
How do you mean?
Like, being here alive is a waste because...
I don't enjoy it, I'm not happy or grateful... and I'm taking a spot away from someone who maybe would've gotten something more out of it.
Yeah.
I guess I don't think it works that way.
Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about.
Do animals have an afterlife?
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.
What happens to them after they die?
I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.
Do they have their own animal afterlife?
And if they do, is it subdivided by species?
Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife shouldn't practice segregation.
And what happens to a child?
Hold hands till we fall asleep?
This doesn't seem entirely fair.
Shh.
Yeah, okay.
Lacey?
Okay, Toby?
Did you hit...?
Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
I'm hitting it.
Hit it again.
- You're gonna fry the body.
- Toby, hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Is this just a setback or...?
I'm really not sure.
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
I'm sorry...
I can't.
Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing with my body?
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.
We do still have a little time to prep a redo.
Redo?
Guys, come on.
You almost fried the body.
You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early.
All right?
Toby, rustle up a van.
Will's right.
It's good.
Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.
It's where you belong.
Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
- Okay.
- How'd you end up here?
Why?
I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.
To get there.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
They didn't want me to come.
Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
What's wrong with you?
Oh.
Nothing, I'm just...
I'm processing.
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?
Let's do an experiment.
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm driving.
Okay.
I don't know you very well.
I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.
Shut up.
- You want the head or the feet?
- Head.
Okay.
"Oh, hey, Isla.
What are you up to?"
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.
I'm just...
lugging a corpse through a parking lot."
- Why'd you go with "Jim"?
- Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself,
I can be supportive.
Do we just leave it here?
Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so...
I'm improvising.
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird, but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot.
- That was pretty good.
- Shut up.
Get out.
- I'm saying you're doing a good job.
Fine.
- Stop it.
Sorry.
Yeah, no, bad...
Bad reception on the island.
Um...
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and...
I don't know.
Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.
Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Bye.
- How'd that go?
- It went really well.
Okay.
You're, like, weirdly good at that.
- Oh.
- Here they are.
They're pretty confused.
What do you think they're thinking?
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days.
We're both going to hell.
Yeah.
Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.
I don't know.
Just stupid.
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
I'm sorry...
I can't.
Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
What if this life is just a dream?
Can I borrow your truck?
Just for...
I have to go get some stuff.
As far as our records indicate, we've had 23 patients with the name Phillips on file.
- How accurate are your records?
- Accurate.
I would love to see that list.
Mm.
I'm sure you would.
What the fuck?
Are you looking for something?
Maybe you can help me.
Um...
- Did there used to be a hallway here?
- Used to.
They did a little remodeling.
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?
About a decade ago.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
This is, uh...
This is interesting.
Okay, thank you, Toby.
Thank you, my boy.
Well, hello to you all.
As always, it's a pleasure.
When you all first got here, you...
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.
The questionnaire.
And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built.
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.
There's a lot of loose talk going on.
And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus.
Lacey, would you join me, please?
- What's going on?
- It's okay.
Relax.
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?
Um... just over a year.
Just over a year.
You were one of the first.
How have you been treated?
Have you been treated well?
- Have I been good to you?
- You've been wonderful.
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- I've been wonderful.
If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device, and particularly...
why are you saying it failed?
Speak up.
Um...
It's okay.
I just told one person.
It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited.
You mean Isla.
You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?
It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked.
Tell everyone where I found you.
Thomas.
It's okay.
This is a safe place.
In the woods.
Go on.
I had a gun.
And where was that gun aimed?
At my chest.
Right next to your heart.
Usually, it's the head...
or the barrel goes into the mouth.
I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before.
I'm sorry.
Please don't lose faith in me.
"Faith."
Oh, God.
I have such contempt for that word.
Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Thomas, please.
Pack up your belongings.
Say your goodbyes.
That was a hell of a show out there.
Come on, Will.
You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?
You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.
It gives them purpose.
And I care about them.
Yeah.
Someone should tell that to Lacey.
You...
You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.
Work, by the way, that we did together.
But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.
- It was always about your mother.
- Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.
Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to.
- Hey.
Can I show you something?
- What?
- Just come with me.
Please.
- Sorry.
Wait.
- What is this?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.
- You were gonna keep this from me?
- No, I'm...
I'm showing you now.
And I was afraid of what you might do.
All right, so, the afterlife...
This is the afterlife?
How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording?
Then what is it?
My theory is that my father invented something that records memory.
You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.
I understand that you wanted this to be something different.
The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
It should be definitive.
Where the fuck are we going?
If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life,
I'm gonna find out exactly when.
Since this hospital opened, there have been 23 patients named Phillips.
But based on the model of his truck,
I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000.
Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names?
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore, so, we can also cross off any Phillips from the past decade.
That leaves us with one.
"Connor Phillips"?
That's him.
That's Pat Phillips' dad.
He died here 13 years ago.
So, it does just record a memory?
It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh?
With Lacey?
She spoke out of turn.
And she knew the rules.
She basically helped write them.
It's just you and me talking.
You don't believe that.
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.
Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life.
That's what I believe.
Yeah... everybody else's, too.
Dad has no intention... of showing anything the machine records with the outside world.
That's why he lost it when Lacey told people.
If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody, why is he doing it, huh?
What's the point?
"Why is he doing it?"
"Why is he doing it?"
Let's see.
Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
I heard that yesterday.
I've been hearing that for the past two years now.
And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things.
I know Mom died...
Not died.
She killed herself.
She killed herself.
And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
Hmm?
Dad does need... to know.
He needs to know that she made it somewhere.
He overreacted, that's all.
He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.
Dad always comes to his senses.
It's not a memory, Will.
What?
On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.
- How is that possible?
- I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.
It wasn't a lighthouse.
It was waves on his arm.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's not a memory.
This is something else.
If it's not a memory, then what is it?
Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore.
I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone.
We need to find something in this video that still exists.
The...
The woman.
There's a...
Her.
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.
So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.
Will, why are we back here?
I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...
Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
This is where I saw whatever...
Whatever it is that I saw.
This is the beach.
I used to come here when I was a kid, like...
I was drawn to it.
Or it made me feel better.
Anyway...
Um... when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...
That's why I was here.
What?
I had a son... and he was five years old.
And I fell asleep... just for a second.
And when I woke up, he was gone.
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
But maybe I was wrong.
Um, hi.
Is this the Phillips residence?
Connor...
Did you know Connor Phillips?
Pat Phillips?
Can you speak English?
Okay.
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.
Maybe they moved or something.
Should we see if they have the new address?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Can I help you?
I haven't seen my brother in years.
I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me.
Alzheimer's.
She deteriorated after Dad died.
- Connor?
- You knew my father, too?
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.
That he went to see him before he died.
Well, anyway, Dad died and...
Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that.
My husband and I, we own the house now.
Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat?
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying, you don't seem that upset about your brother's death.
Look... it seems as though you liked him.
You found something in him... so, I'm sorry.
But to the rest of us...
he was a piece of shit who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father and a mother who lost every marble she ever had.
I'm sorry.
So...
is the last time that you saw Pat when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.
If he told you that, it's a lie.
He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.
This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?
He told you about that?
Well...
When he turned 18, we got matching waves.
We were really close then.
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.
It wasn't a bad theory.
People are just gonna keep killing themselves.
You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad.
I've been thinking a lot about the difference between... what something is and what something means.
And I don't know what any of this is... but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it, it has something to do with not pressing the reset button, even if things get really rough.
We're a bunch of people running around, making the same mistakes over and over.
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else... unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here.
What was your son's name?
Oliver.
I was dreaming.
When he was in the water, I was dreaming.
What about?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't... don't know what about.
I wish I knew.
You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.
Will!
Fuck!
Fuck, Will!
Get up.
It's Dad.
What the fuck are you doing?
What about Dad?
- It's dad.
Get the fuck up.
- Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.
He hooked himself up to the device.
He wanted to prove that it works.
- Dad's hooked up right now?
- Yes.
We need to tell him that it works.
What?
What works?
- What are you doing?
- He demanded.
- Why aren't you bringing him back?
- He's too far along.
We already know that it records something.
Cooper... it works, okay?
Dad?
Dad?
Time to pull yourself away.
Come back to reality.
Come home.
- Is that Mom?
- It's Mom.
What I'm doing is reality.
I need to finish.
It's important.
Do you understand?
- Their anniversary.
- Yeah.
I'm going upstairs.
Now, don't be dramatic.
I'll be done soon.
And we can have dinner.
Honey, wait.
Maybe work can wait.
So, what do you say we have some dinner?
She's not taking the bath.
- That's not what happened.
- I know.
We can bring him back.
Cooper, just... wait.
We have to see what happens.
We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late.
Will, come on.
Toby, I'm sorry.
Cooper, now!
Dad?
Dad, listen to me.
Dad, please.
Listen to my voice.
- Is he gonna be brain...?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Cooper, hit it again!
Dad?
What happened?
I knew I saw her.
Like a dream that you can't remember.
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.
I never left my study.
Never stopped her on the stairs.
- And she drew a bath.
- I know.
And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm.
I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.
But... what if it's a different plane...
of this existence?
Alternate realities?
No, our reality...
with differences and variations.
Stepping out of a truck...
to visit a dying parent.
Random, like different tattoos.
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.
When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?
A second chance?
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.
In the afterlife, we could change it.
At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out...
We have to destroy the machine.
Hey, Thomas.
Everyone wants to know what's going on.
Welcome, everybody.
Nice to have you all here.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
- Hi.
- Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.
- You got to see your mom again.
- I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
And as family...
I think sometimes we get so absorbed with... what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth, we lose the fact that how important family is.
Lacey?
Lacey.
Lacey, it's okay.
Put the...
Put the gun down.
Lacey, I was wrong.
You do not need to do this.
I didn't kill her.
I just relocated her.
Isla?
Isla?
Isla.
Oh, it's okay.
Isla?
Dad!
Oh, God.
Dad, please!
I need your help!
Somebody go get help.
I just wanted my spot back.
Okay.
Okay.
Isla.
Dad, please help her.
Don't talk.
Just breathe.
I don't wanna die anymore.
You're okay.
I just need you to stay with me.
Yeah.
Ha!
Isla?
Isla?
They were asking, the cops, who to contact for Isla.
- Next-of-kin deal.
- I'll have Cooper look into it.
Okay.
I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay?
Okay.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
- Maybe I should go in and check on him...
- No, no, no.
Don't.
He needs rest.
He needs to process, okay?
- All right.
- You can check on him after dinner.
And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight.
Okay.
But... we haven't come close... to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means.
Like, if it really is another version of our own life, then what happens when we die again?
Toby.
- Toby.
- What?
We've got to let it go for a while.
We've just got to.
Completely dismantled.
- All traces need to be gone.
- Thomas, I hear you.
William?
Let us in, don't do this.
William.
He's on the ferry headed here?
- Not the same here.
- What?
I don't understand.
How are we watching this right now if he's not dead?
since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky...
I was watching that.
Isla?
- Isla?
- It's off-season.
- Why are you going to this dreary island?
- Isla?
- I have to stop your shooting, Isla.
- Sit down.
I need you to come with me right now.
Sit down, Will.
This is just your memory.
I'm a part of you.
Sit down.
What are we doing back on this ferry?
What the fuck is going on?
You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.
"This life"?
What do you...?
What do you mean, "this life"?
You always start back on the ferry.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
Well, it looks like we're here.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I don't know what I was thinking.
The first time, you never got off the ferry.
Then the next day you read that a woman named Isla had drowned herself.
You went on and lived your life, but the thought that you could've done something never left.
It was always there.
And then one day, just like everybody else...
I died.
And then you came back here.
How long have I been stuck living in this loop?
How many times have we met on this ferry?
Your death brings you back here.
You keep coming back over and over again and again.
I don't remember any of it.
I don't remember these other lives.
Nobody can remember them directly.
But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.
You look so familiar to me.
You look so familiar to me.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
- This is where I saw whatever...
- This is the beach.
How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?
We're a bunch of people running around making the same mistakes over and over.
And I just don't know why we think it's gonna be different someplace else.
What am I supposed to change?
You already changed it.
You kept coming back until you saved me.
I didn't save you, you died.
There's more than one way to save somebody, Will.
Cooper, ready on our end.
We need to bring him back.
How can I hear my dad?
He's in a different place.
Two separate parts in the same place.
Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.
No, no, no.
I'm not ready to go back yet.
I need more time with you.
Toby, please wait!
Not yet!
His vitals are concerning me.
If we pull him now, we might lose him.
Isla.
Isla, please.
I'm not ready to leave you.
- What's happening to me?
- You're about to die.
His heart's stopped, Thomas.
Organs are shutting down.
They're trying to bring you back.
That's okay.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
No, not this time.
You don't have to come back anymore.
You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.
When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
I hope so.
Dad, everything is shutting down.
His brain's showing barely any activity.
You're leaving now.
This is it.
I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.
When I get there...
I'm going to remember you.
We've gotta pull him out right now.
One... two... three.
Oh, hey.
Look.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey, come here.
Let me help you.
Come here, come here.
Oh!
I got you.
Whoa!
Whoa!
You okay?
- Holy cow.
- Give me that pail.
- You went down pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.
Yep.
You okay?
I got you.
Whoa!
Where's your mom and dad?
Oliver!
Oliver!
Hi.
It's okay.
He's all right.
He just...
- Okay.
- I told you, you can't...
You can't just run off on me like that, okay?
I've told you.
He was...
He was just...
He's all right.
He was struggling a little bit in the water.
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
He's a good kid.
- You're okay.
- Thanks.
You can't do that.
You scared me.
Okay?
Can you walk a little bit?
[woman] Dr. Harber, before we're live,
I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
[woman] The rich history you have with other journalists...
[Harber] I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.
Now, don't fuck it up.
[woman 2] Fifteen seconds.
People trust you...
for decades have valued you.
I think that's because people value the truth.
Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous to share with the world?
Look, this has been my life's work for over 40 years.
There's nothing willy-nilly here.
After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion.
-Which is?
-Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus, how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?
And that discovery...
You proved the existence of an afterlife.
I prefer to call it a new plane of existence.
I can't comment on terminology like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"
but what I can say with scientific certainty is that once the body dies, some part of our consciousness leaves us and travels to a new plane.
Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death.
-Is that...?
-That's correct.
Where do those wavelengths go?
My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.
But you can't tell us what that is exactly.
When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?
It's a tough pill to swallow.
At one point, so was the Earth being round.
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us?
Where have you been?
It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.
Yes, you did.
Thank you.
But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.
And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives.
Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters.
Okay.
I wanna ask you the question that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.
Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves?
No.
-That's it?
-That's it.
[man] Thank you, Dr. Harber...
for my fresh start.
[woman 1] Andy, no!
Andy!
-Andy!
-[woman 2] Oh, no.
[woman 1] Oh, God!
-Why would you do that?
-[woman 2] Somebody call 911.
[woman 1] Help!
Some....
Call help, please.
Right now.
Get someone here.
My God!
Why would you do that?
Oh, God.
Turn those cameras off.
[man] Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.
We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years, with retrospectives all weekend long.
Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has skyrocketed to staggering levels.
Over four million people have taken their lives, attempting to "get there."
As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance since that infamous post-Discovery interview.
Completely off the grid--
[woman] I was listening to that.
I was listening to that.
I'm sorry, I thought-- I thought that I was alone.
It's off-season.
Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island?
Well, you're going there.
[moans]
Hi.
Hi.
Are you one of those lunatics who just sits next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater?
You look so familiar to me.
It's possible we've met, but you don't have a memorable face.
Okay. [chuckles]
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I didn't mean that.
I just...
The water.
I'm just a little seasick.
That's weird.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
Um...
-Vertigo.
-I'm not dizzy.
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects.
That's for nausea.
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy?
Fair enough.
Isla.
My name's Isla.
I don't look like an Isla, though.
Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...
-What about you?
-What?
What's your name?
Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.
[mouths] Will.
What?
I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.
-What's the verdict there?
-I don't know.
It's too early to tell.
You know, Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.
[chuckles]
You're really something.
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.
They said on the news they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today.
People trying to get there for the anniversary.
I heard something about that.
Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders taking pills on the 50-yard line?
I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups.
It's so... disingenuous, you know?
It just feels so weak.
-You don't believe in the Discovery?
-No, I don't believe in suicide groups.
The Discovery is-- I mean, the proof is overwhelming.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
Proof should be definitive.
So, you don't believe.
I don't believe the way everybody else does.
No, I don't.
-And how's that?
-I'm a neurologist.
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young, found out that she had brain cancer.
Very sad.
She reacted to that diagnosis as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.
It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better.
It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed.
Well, yeah.
Death used to be something we just had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape pain.
That's okay.
That's okay?
Another plane of existence, maybe.
Who knows?
But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes hoping they're gonna grow wings.
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
[car engine revving]
What?
When I was five, I had an accident, and I died for about a minute.
When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something.
Flashes.
A little boy.
Me, maybe, or my brother.
I felt stranded...
Stranded where?
This empty beach.
It doesn't matter.
It was a dream.
It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up.
[vehicle approaching]
Why would you make all that up?
I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just...
lie.
We lie to ourselves.
You are so annoying.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Yeah, they have.
Ugh.
Thank God we only have a minute left together before we're strangers again.
You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year?
You're crazy.
[vehicle approaching]
Crazy, but right.
That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in.
[Isla] You'd better work on your math.
Hey!
For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla.
How many of us have you met?
[Isla chuckles] [door closes]
[horn honking]
[country music playing over stereo]
-I got it.
-No, I got it, man.
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.
-What's going on over here?
-Eddie.
-Wait, Eddie Iodice?
Eddie died?
-Mm-hmm.
Yeah, just to get there.
Just to fucking get there.
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe, downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.
[chuckles]
Good dude, too.
-Real pity.
-You didn't wanna go to the service?
Go to the...?
I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper
-than go to another fucking funeral.
-Got it.
You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.
When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.
-You're sounding just as paranoid as him.
-[chuckles]
[Toby] Dad said he needed to change things up.
People knowing our address was too dangerous.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.
Here we are.
Off to see the wizard.
[Will] What the fuck is this place?
Uh, it used to be a summer camp for "troubled youths."
Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids, why would they deserve a fun summer?
You know?
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.
What do you think?
[Will] I think it's completely insane.
Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things.
House what things?
[Toby] These people were all affected by the Discovery.
Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts.
We gave them a home, something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.
Oh, uh, real quick.
Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.
-Yeah, okay.
Let's go.
-Yeah.
Hey, don't worry.
[beeping] [equipment beeping] [man] This is truly thrilling.
I can only compare it to the model train set you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.
[woman] Cutting it a little close.
[Toby] Oh, well, you know me.
Pins and needles, needles and pins.
These goddamn machines.
-Who the hell's that?
-His other son just returned.
Surprisingly taller than I remember.
Good to see you again, Cooper.
Will, Lacey.
Lacey...
That went well.
Where's Dad?
-Is he dead?
-No, of course not.
He is now.
-[Lacey] Fifteen seconds.
-Dad?
[alarm beeping]
Take it easy.
They're just running some tests.
-It's all routine.
-Ten seconds.
Paddles charged... and ready.
[defibrillator shocks]
See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.
The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.
[exhales]
-[high-pitched tone] -[muffled chatter] [door opens and closes]
So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.
No.
Kind of.
But you're...
You're looking at this all wrong.
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...
What is it?
Rose-colored glasses.
That's what you're wearing.
Shit-colored glasses.
Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
And we both know you've always been slightly skeptical of everything.
Dad started a cult.
-No.
-Can you not see that?
This is a cult.
All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.
No, no, no.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.
-That's all.
It's not a cult.
-It should be different.
Straitjackets.
You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason.
Right?
Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question.
Welcome back, Will.
[clears throat]
-[Will groans] -[Harber sighs]
You mind telling me something?
What are you doing back here?
I'm here because I want you to stop it.
I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.
How would I do that?
Say that you were wrong.
Take it all back.
I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.
Who knows better than you?
You were the inspiration for this.
Aren't you curious?
Please, don't say that.
That's not...
-I wasn't.
-Ah, but you were.
Hang on.
"Therefore, it is my belief consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."
-Please don't.
-Hang on.
I'd like to get to this other part.
It gets good.
"Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws that govern our universe."
[sighs]
-I was wrong.
-You don't believe that.
We were wrong, Dad.
We were wrong because a lot of people died.
And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves... while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.
So, just slamming on the brakes of 40 years' work?
I'd be saying I'm responsible.
Maybe you are.
So, you think I've gone too far?
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.
We opened the door for these people, Will.
They know it's there.
Now we have to show them what's behind it.
[door closes]
-[high-pitched tone] -[muffled chatter]
Isla!
Isla!
Isla!
[muffled shout]
Isla!
[Will yells]
[Will] Oh, fuck!
-What are you doing?
-What's your problem?
[groans]
Come on.
Stand up.
Get up.
-[Will] Why are you doing this?
-[Isla] None of your fucking business.
You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this.
You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.
You don't get to just change that!
Ah.
You're not even emotional about dying.
I'm not emotional about anything.
[Toby] I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.
[Will] She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.
[Toby] I still don't know what you want me to do with her.
[Will] You told me that you take in people who need help.
She needs help.
She still can't just stay here.
We have rules.
Then can we make an exception...
in her case, please?
We're talking about somebody's life.
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...
Kill myself again?
You can say it.
I know what happened.
I was there when you ruined it.
She and I have been getting along great.
We still have rules.
She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire.
What's the questionnaire?
-Um...
-Can we be...?
Will, you have a visitor.
Your dad is Thomas Harber?
[Harber] So, nobody but the conductor, which is me, is gonna know your answers.
Everything is completely discreet here.
And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy.
It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land, and then it was space travel.
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.
And now it's exploring what comes after this life.
Seeing what's next.
How old are you?
[man on recording] You are all part of the same thing.
Cells in a body.
Waves in the ocean.
The soul isn't young or old.
[Harber] Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?
Pass.
I don't know what that means.
There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire.
-Then why do you bother giving it?
-That's a good response.
[Harber] Okay, greatest ability...
and most disappointing weakness.
[Isla] I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.
Understanding who they really are.
[Harber] Weakness?
I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.
If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
-Memory.
-Dig deeper.
-Hidden memory.
-Would you say that you suppress emotions?
I don't really like talking about myself like this.
You don't have to like it.
We think about ourselves every day.
Everything is from our own perspective.
So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts, they're there.
Make no mistake.
They are there.
[Harber] Do you believe in a soul?
If not, close your eyes.
Great.
Let's just say a soul does exist.
Where in the body do you think it'd be?
I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.
[machine beeps]
[Harber] Wow.
Now, that's interesting.
Most people say the stomach.
But I like that you didn't.
[Harber] Have you ever experienced sudden loss?
Yes.
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone... was the most difficult?
Inanimate objects, maybe?
Like... my coffee table.
I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he--
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.
I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.
[Harber] Okay, last question.
Are you legitimately suicidal?
If you knew what came after...
this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?
Maybe.
Knowing could change things.
How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?
I found our old bed.
Yeah, I see that.
And you should thank me...
by the way, because [grunts]
I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here.
How's Isla?
Oh...
That's actually why I'm here.
Will, she's dead.
No, she's not.
She's not dead.
That was a bad joke.
Um...
But the questionnaire is all wrapped up.
She can stay.
Yeah, good.
She needs to be looked after.
She could try again.
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.
[sighs]
Because tonight... everything changes.
We finally unveil it.
What is "it," Toby?
Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.
Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?
It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.
I'm not advocating murder.
I'm just pointing out that most people don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own.
[sighing] Where is he?
It's about to happen.
I can't tell when you're talking to me or that.
It's really annoying.
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there.
At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else, 'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?
Finally, he's here.
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.
We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.
Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.
But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...
And let your subconscious...
take you somewhere else.
I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.
You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type.
Just because somebody doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they can't pray.
What kind of an atheist talks to God?
[opera music playing over speakers]
Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name?
It wasn't phony.
It was my mother's maiden name.
Where is she?
She's dead.
How did she die?
Because of my dad.
Let us come back into this moment.
I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife.
I can now record where we go.
[Cooper] Please, uh...
get these back to us at your earliest convenience.
And again, these living quarters are just temporary until we can find you a more suitable room.
When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen.
-Glamorous.
-[chuckles]
I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean, so this should be fine.
Can I have a pen?
Nondisclosure agreement.
Well, considering the sensitivity, it's a fairly standard document.
Could we have the room for a second, please?
[Cooper] You remember that awful week when we slept on the cot by the fridge?
My back sure hasn't forgotten.
-[Will] Hey.
-Mm.
So...
I know that that device is very compelling.
Um...
-Can we talk about it for a second?
-I'm not allowed to talk about it, 'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.
[snickers] [sighs]
So, your dad's a little weird.
Who cares?
It doesn't make him wrong.
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.
It didn't make him any less a writer.
I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.
Well, what if it did?
How would that change things?
You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.
Hey.
Uh...
I'm sorry.
Were you sleeping?
I'm standing.
Well, yeah.
That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.
Um...
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?
Yeah, sure.
[sighs] [woman on recording] Those that we have lost are not lost at all...
-[Isla] Where are you guys going?
-It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
...then it's us who are lost.
When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.
Flip it on, flip it off.
But going under, hooked up to the new device, you're not just flipping a light switch.
You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.
So, I'd say that if you go under again... you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.
I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already.
I know you wanted to be first, but if you don't come back, what's the point?
We just go back to the drawing board.
Right?
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...
We need a cadaver.
Okay.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?
I have a corpse idea.
[rock music playing over earbuds]
-Am I being rude?
-Huh?
-Am I being rude?
-No.
-Care to...
listen?
-Sure.
Crunchy groovy grooves.
Serene nights.
-Can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.
Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.
That she killed herself?
Not exactly.
So, she was trying to get there?
No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery.
Huh.
[bell rings]
Yeah.
[door buzzes]
How you doing?
In the midst of life, I am in death.
That was weird.
I was just wondering if you could help me out.
My, uh, cousin, Billy... he's gone missing.
And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery, we're all just a little worried.
Really worried.
We got three John Does in this week.
How long has he been missing?
Nope.
No.
No Billy here.
Bummer.
Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier.
Sorry, that was insensitive.
They just got me running rampant here.
I'm doing the job of five people.
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot?
Yeah.
Can I give you a description... of Billy?
That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.
Of course.
Let's go to my office.
[Toby] Hey, so, just curious... [chuckles]
I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.
Aneurysm, that won't work.
It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering.
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.
And then, um... he's got a birthmark on, uh...
Let's see.
On his right elbow.
You're not writing any of this down.
Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so...
But we...
We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body.
Don't you think it's weird how these people were alive a few hours ago?
They had fears and desires, they could exercise?
I don't think it's weird.
I think it's fucking sad.
-Maybe they went someplace better.
-Maybe they went someplace worse.
Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend.
All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.
Shit.
What?
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."
Will... meet Pat Phillips.
Pat Phillips, this is Will.
I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.
Top or bottom?
We could talk, you know.
When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.
Well, you're safe here.
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.
When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit, it had a V etched on it.
I wonder what that stood for.
"Visitor," maybe?
Is that a guess?
That was a pretty good guess.
It's like one of those really obvious answers that only seems obvious after you find out about it.
Were you really smart growing up?
I bet you were.
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.
I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.
Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.
Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."
These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
Sorry, all I heard was something about circles and not fucking me.
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will.
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.
There's not much to tell.
She killed herself.
On their anniversary.
How did she do it?
She made them dinner, and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.
If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?
But he couldn't be bothered.
So, she went upstairs... took a bath instead and, uh...
Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.
And so, you left?
Yeah, I had to.
I couldn't be around it.
I knew.
It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable.
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad.
How do you mean?
Like, being here alive is a waste because...
I don't enjoy it, I'm not happy or grateful... and I'm taking a spot away from someone who maybe would've gotten something more out of it.
Yeah.
I guess I don't think it works that way.
Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about.
Do animals have an afterlife?
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.
What happens to them after they die?
I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.
Do they have their own animal afterlife?
And if they do, is it subdivided by species?
Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife shouldn't practice segregation.
[Will chuckles]
And what happens to a child?
Hold hands till we fall asleep?
This doesn't seem entirely fair.
Shh.
Yeah, okay.
[speaking indistinctly]
Lacey?
Okay, Toby?
[machine beeps, then whirs]
Did you hit...?
Hit it again.
[beeps, then whirs]
Again.
[beeping and whirring continue]
Hit it again.
I'm hitting it.
Hit it again.
-You're gonna fry the body.
-Toby, hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
Again.
Hit it again.
[door closes]
Is this just a setback or...?
I'm really not sure.
[keypad beeping] [door opens]
[door closes]
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
[Pat] I'm sorry...
I can't.
[woman] Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
-Hey.
-Hey.
What are you doing with my body?
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.
We do still have a little time to prep a redo.
Redo?
Guys, come on.
You almost fried the body.
You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early.
All right?
Toby, rustle up a van.
Will's right.
It's good.
Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.
It's where you belong.
-[sighs] -[door closes]
[inaudible dialogue]
Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
-Okay.
-How'd you end up here?
Why?
I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.
To get there.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
They didn't want me to come.
Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
What's wrong with you?
Oh.
Nothing, I'm just...
I'm processing.
[groans]
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?
Let's do an experiment.
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm driving.
Okay.
I don't know you very well.
I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.
Shut up.
-You want the head or the feet?
-Head.
Okay.
"Oh, hey, Isla.
What are you up to?"
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.
I'm just...
lugging a corpse through a parking lot."
-Why'd you go with "Jim"?
-Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself,
I can be supportive.
Do we just leave it here?
Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so...
I'm improvising.
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird, but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot.
-That was pretty good.
-Shut up.
Get out.
-I'm saying you're doing a good job.
Fine.
-Stop it.
Sorry.
Yeah, no, bad...
Bad reception on the island.
Um...
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and...
I don't know.
Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.
Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Bye.
-How'd that go?
-It went really well.
Okay.
You're, like, weirdly good at that.
-Oh.
-Here they are.
-[Isla chuckles]
-They're pretty confused.
What do you think they're thinking?
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days.
We're both going to hell.
Yeah.
Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.
I don't know.
Just stupid.
[sighs] [engine starts]
Are you gonna see him?
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
[Pat] I'm sorry...
I can't.
[woman] Of course you can't.
Story of your fucking life.
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.
[woman on recording] What if this life is just a dream?
Can I borrow your truck?
Just for...
I have to go get some stuff.
[woman] As far as our records indicate, we've had 23 patients with the name Phillips on file.
-How accurate are your records?
-Accurate.
I would love to see that list.
Mm.
I'm sure you would.
What the fuck?
Are you looking for something?
Maybe you can help me.
Um...
-Did there used to be a hallway here?
-Used to.
They did a little remodeling.
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?
About a decade ago.
[electric guitar playing gently]
[Isla] Hey.
-Hey.
-Where have you been?
This is, uh...
This is interesting.
Okay, thank you, Toby.
Thank you, my boy.
Well, hello to you all.
As always, it's a pleasure.
When you all first got here, you...
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.
The questionnaire.
And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built.
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.
There's a lot of loose talk going on.
And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus.
Lacey, would you join me, please?
-What's going on?
-It's okay.
Relax.
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?
Um... just over a year.
Just over a year.
You were one of the first.
How have you been treated?
Have you been treated well?
-Have I been good to you?
-You've been wonderful.
-Why are you talking to me like this?
-I've been wonderful.
If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device, and particularly...
why are you saying it failed?
Speak up.
Um...
It's okay.
I just told one person.
It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited.
[Harber] You mean Isla.
You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?
It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked.
Tell everyone where I found you.
Thomas.
It's okay.
This is a safe place.
In the woods.
Go on.
I had a gun.
And where was that gun aimed?
At my chest.
Right next to your heart.
Usually, it's the head...
or the barrel goes into the mouth.
I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before.
I'm sorry.
Please don't lose faith in me.
"Faith."
Oh, God.
I have such contempt for that word.
Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Thomas, please.
Pack up your belongings.
Say your goodbyes.
That was a hell of a show out there.
Come on, Will.
You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?
You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.
It gives them purpose.
And I care about them.
Yeah.
Someone should tell that to Lacey.
You...
You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.
Work, by the way, that we did together.
But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.
-It was always about your mother.
-Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.
Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to.
[door closes]
[indistinct chatter]
-Hey.
Can I show you something?
-What?
-Just come with me.
Please.
-Sorry.
[Isla] Wait.
-What is this?
-That's what I'm trying to figure out.
-You were gonna keep this from me?
-No, I'm...
I'm showing you now.
And I was afraid of what you might do.
All right, so, the afterlife...
This is the afterlife?
How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording?
Then what is it?
My theory is that my father invented something that records memory.
You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.
I understand that you wanted this to be something different.
The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory.
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
It should be definitive.
[beeps]
Where the fuck are we going?
[Will] If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life,
I'm gonna find out exactly when.
Since this hospital opened, there have been 23 patients named Phillips.
But based on the model of his truck,
I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000.
Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names?
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore, so, we can also cross off any Phillips from the past decade.
That leaves us with one.
"Connor Phillips"?
That's him.
That's Pat Phillips' dad.
He died here 13 years ago.
So, it does just record a memory?
[Will] It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh?
With Lacey?
She spoke out of turn.
And she knew the rules.
She basically helped write them.
It's just you and me talking.
You don't believe that.
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.
Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life.
That's what I believe.
Yeah... everybody else's, too.
Dad has no intention... of showing anything the machine records with the outside world.
That's why he lost it when Lacey told people.
If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody, why is he doing it, huh?
What's the point?
"Why is he doing it?"
[chuckles]
"Why is he doing it?"
Let's see.
Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
I heard that yesterday.
I've been hearing that for the past two years now.
[Toby chuckles]
And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things.
I know Mom died...
Not died.
She killed herself.
She killed herself.
And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
Hmm?
Dad does need... to know.
He needs to know that she made it somewhere.
He overreacted, that's all.
He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.
Dad always comes to his senses.
It's not a memory, Will.
What?
[Isla] On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.
-[Will] How is that possible?
-I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.
It wasn't a lighthouse.
It was waves on his arm.
-Are you sure?
-Yes.
It's not a memory.
This is something else.
If it's not a memory, then what is it?
Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore.
I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone.
We need to find something in this video that still exists.
The...
The woman.
There's a...
Her.
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.
So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.
Will, why are we back here?
I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...
Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
[sighs]
This is where I saw whatever...
Whatever it is that I saw.
This is the beach.
I used to come here when I was a kid, like...
I was drawn to it.
Or it made me feel better.
Anyway...
Um... when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...
That's why I was here.
What?
I had a son... and he was five years old.
And I fell asleep... just for a second.
And when I woke up, he was gone.
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
But maybe I was wrong.
[Will sighs]
Um, hi.
Is this the Phillips residence?
Connor...
Did you know Connor Phillips?
Pat Phillips?
Can you speak English?
Okay.
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.
Maybe they moved or something.
Should we see if they have the new address?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Can I help you?
I haven't seen my brother in years.
I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me.
Alzheimer's.
She deteriorated after Dad died.
-Connor?
-You knew my father, too?
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.
That he went to see him before he died.
Well, anyway, Dad died and...
Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that.
My husband and I, we own the house now.
Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat?
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying, you don't seem that upset about your brother's death.
[sighing] Look... it seems as though you liked him.
You found something in him... so, I'm sorry.
But to the rest of us...
he was a piece of shit who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father and a mother who lost every marble she ever had.
I'm sorry.
So... [clears throat] is the last time that you saw Pat when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital?
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital.
If he told you that, it's a lie.
He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.
This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?
He told you about that?
Well...
When he turned 18, we got matching waves.
We were really close then.
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.
It wasn't a bad theory.
People are just gonna keep killing themselves.
You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad.
I've been thinking a lot about the difference between... what something is and what something means.
And I don't know what any of this is... but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it, it has something to do with not pressing the reset button, even if things get really rough.
We're a bunch of people running around, making the same mistakes over and over.
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else... unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here.
[Isla sighs]
What was your son's name?
Oliver.
I was dreaming.
When he was in the water, I was dreaming.
What about?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't... don't know what about.
I wish I knew.
You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.
[Toby] Will!
Fuck!
Fuck, Will!
Get up.
It's Dad.
What the fuck are you doing?
What about Dad?
-It's dad.
Get the fuck up.
-Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.
He hooked himself up to the device.
He wanted to prove that it works.
-Dad's hooked up right now?
-Yes.
[Isla] We need to tell him that it works.
What?
What works?
-What are you doing?
-He demanded.
-Why aren't you bringing him back?
-He's too far along.
We already know that it records something.
Cooper... it works, okay?
Dad?
Dad?
[woman] Time to pull yourself away.
Come back to reality.
Come home.
-Is that Mom?
-It's Mom.
[Harber] What I'm doing is reality.
I need to finish.
It's important.
Do you understand?
-Their anniversary.
-Yeah.
[woman] I'm going upstairs.
[Harber] Now, don't be dramatic.
I'll be done soon.
And we can have dinner.
[Harber] Honey, wait.
Maybe work can wait.
So, what do you say we have some dinner?
She's not taking the bath.
-That's not what happened.
-I know.
We can bring him back.
Cooper, just... wait.
We have to see what happens.
[Cooper] We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late.
Will, come on.
Toby, I'm sorry.
Cooper, now!
-Dad?
Dad, listen to me.
-[defibrillator shocks]
Dad, please.
Listen to my voice.
-Is he gonna be brain...?
-I don't know.
I don't know.
Cooper, hit it again!
[defibrillator shocks]
Dad?
[machine beeping]
What happened?
I knew I saw her.
Like a dream that you can't remember.
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.
I never left my study.
Never stopped her on the stairs.
-And she drew a bath.
-[Will] I know.
And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm.
[Harber] I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.
But... what if it's a different plane...
of this existence?
Alternate realities?
No, our reality...
with differences and variations.
Stepping out of a truck...
to visit a dying parent.
Random, like different tattoos.
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.
When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?
A second chance?
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.
In the afterlife, we could change it.
At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out--
We have to destroy the machine.
[Cooper] Hey, Thomas.
Everyone wants to know what's going on.
Welcome, everybody.
Nice to have you all here.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.
-Hi.
-Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.
-You got to see your mom again.
-[Harber] I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
And as family...
I think sometimes we get so absorbed with... what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth, we lose the fact that how important family is.
-[gunshot] -[all gasp]
Lacey?
Lacey.
Lacey, it's okay.
Put the...
Put the gun down.
Lacey, I was wrong.
You do not need to do this.
I didn't kill her.
I just relocated her.
[Will] Isla?
Isla?
Isla.
Oh, it's okay.
Isla?
Dad!
Oh, God.
Dad, please!
I need your help!
[woman] Somebody go get help.
[panting] I just wanted my spot back.
Okay.
Okay.
[Will] Isla.
Dad, please help her.
Don't talk.
Just breathe.
I don't wanna die anymore.
[muffled] You're okay.
I just need you to stay with me.
[boy] Yeah.
Ha!
[Will mutters]
Isla?
Isla?
[Toby] They were asking, the cops, who to contact for Isla.
-Next-of-kin deal.
-[Harber] I'll have Cooper look into it.
[Toby] Okay.
I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay?
Okay.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah.
-Maybe I should go in and check on him--
-No, no, no.
Don't.
He needs rest.
He needs to process, okay?
-All right.
-You can check on him after dinner.
And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight.
[Toby] Okay.
But... we haven't come close... to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means.
Like, if it really is another version of our own life, then what happens when we die again?
[Harber] Toby.
-Toby.
-What?
[Harber] We've got to let it go for a while.
We've just got to.
[grunting]
[Harber] Completely dismantled.
-All traces need to be gone.
-Thomas, I hear you.
[panting]
[grunts]
[Harber] William?
Let us in, don't do this.
William.
[machine beeping]
He's on the ferry headed here?
-Not the same here.
-What?
I don't understand.
How are we watching this right now if he's not dead?
[man on TV] ...since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended with an on-air suicide.
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky--
[Isla] I was watching that.
Isla?
-Isla?
-[Isla] It's off-season.
-Why are you going to this dreary island?
-Isla?
-I have to stop your shooting, Isla.
-Sit down.
I need you to come with me right now.
Sit down, Will.
This is just your memory.
I'm a part of you.
Sit down.
What are we doing back on this ferry?
What the fuck is going on?
You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.
"This life"?
What do you...?
What do you mean, "this life"?
You always start back on the ferry.
[Will] Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.
They don't exist in the same space.
Well, it looks like we're here.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I don't know what I was thinking.
[Isla] The first time, you never got off the ferry.
Then the next day you read that a woman named Isla had drowned herself.
You went on and lived your life, but the thought that you could've done something never left.
It was always there.
[brakes squeak]
[Isla] And then one day, just like everybody else...
I died.
And then you came back here.
How long have I been stuck living in this loop?
How many times have we met on this ferry?
Your death brings you back here.
You keep coming back over and over again and again.
I don't remember any of it.
I don't remember these other lives.
Nobody can remember them directly.
But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.
[Will] You look so familiar to me.
You look so familiar to me.
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.
-This is where I saw whatever...
-[Will] This is the beach.
[Toby] How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?
[Will] We're a bunch of people running around making the same mistakes over and over.
And I just don't know why we think it's gonna be different someplace else.
What am I supposed to change?
You already changed it.
You kept coming back until you saved me.
I didn't save you, you died.
There's more than one way to save somebody, Will.
[Harber] Cooper, ready on our end.
We need to bring him back.
How can I hear my dad?
He's in a different place.
Two separate parts in the same place.
[Toby] Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.
No, no, no.
I'm not ready to go back yet.
I need more time with you.
Toby, please wait!
Not yet!
[Cooper] His vitals are concerning me.
If we pull him now, we might lose him.
Isla.
Isla, please.
I'm not ready to leave you.
-What's happening to me?
-You're about to die.
[Cooper] His heart's stopped, Thomas.
Organs are shutting down.
They're trying to bring you back.
That's okay.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
No, not this time.
You don't have to come back anymore.
You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.
When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
I hope so.
[Toby] Dad, everything is shutting down.
His brain's showing barely any activity.
You're leaving now.
This is it.
[Harber] I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.
When I get there...
I'm going to remember you.
[Harber] We've gotta pull him out right now.
One... two... three.
[monitor flatlines]
[boy chuckles]
Oh, hey.
Look.
You okay?
-Yeah.
-Hey, come here.
Let me help you.
Come here, come here.
Oh!
I got you.
Whoa!
Whoa!
[boy laughing]
You okay?
-Holy cow.
-Give me that pail.
-You went down pretty good, huh?
-Yeah.
Yep.
You okay?
I got you.
Whoa!
[grunts]
Where's your mom and dad?
Oliver!
Oliver!
Hi.
It's okay.
He's all right.
He just...
-Okay.
-I told you, you can't--
You can't just run off on me like that, okay?
I've told you.
He was...
He was just...
He's all right.
He was struggling a little bit in the water.
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
He's a good kid.
-You're okay.
-Thanks.
[Will chuckles]
[Isla] You can't do that.
You scared me.
Okay?
Can you walk a little bit?

[playing notes]
[audience applauds and cheers]
Hey, guys.
Wanna see a cool trick?
Watch this.
-[audience cheers] -[Bill chuckles]
Good thing I had that magician's wire.
[audience laughs]
See, it's true.
You can't always believe your eyes.
We see what we expect to see.
And that's why we can be so easily fooled.
Ever been mesmerized?
This is a portrait of Franz Anton Mesmer.
He coined the term "animal magnetism" and believed he could use it to mesmerize and hypnotize humans and, uh, animals.
[audience laughs]
Uh, but that didn't work.
Hey, uh, thanks, Todd.
See you after the show.
[audience laughs] [theme music playing]
Hello, hello.
Welcome to the show.
I am Bill Nye, and I'm here to save the world from malarkey.
[audience laughs]
Let me explain.
[audience cheers]
Just put my feet up the way I do.
There are several common pitfalls when determining cause and effect in a complex system.
[audience laughs]
[audience laughs]
To avoid these, we first observe a situation and then hypothesize a reason for what was observed.
From there-- [audience laughs]
Cool.
All right.
We test the hypothesis, not to prove ourselves right, but to try and prove ourselves wrong.
Otherwise, we can reach incorrect conclusions.
[audience laughs]
Ah, there we go.
-Do we need a--?
Do we need--?
-[man] Sorry, Bill.
We're having some power problems.
It should be good now.
Uh, thanks.
See, I thought the lamp started working again because I had tapped it.
I was wrong.
Perhaps I should have known, several taps didn't do anything at all, but when it did work,
I still thought it was me.
I kept remembering the hits and forgetting the misses.
It's like being a fan of the Eagles.
[audience laughs]
I was suffering from confirmation bias.
I only paid attention to the evidence that supported my belief, my bias.
And I ignored what contradicted it.
Confirmation bias is a sort of brain trap, which is why, in science, we try to prove ourselves wrong, not try to prove ourselves right, right?
Wrong.
Exactly.
[audience laughs]
Fighting confirmation bias is even harder when we really want to believe in something.
And a lot of us want to believe in literally incredible things.
Ghosts, astrology, Bigfoots.
[audience laughs]
Hi, Sanden.
[growls]
-Hi, Mr. Foot.
-[audience laughs]
He's really into it.
And that's when a pseudoscience is born.
Charlatans use confirmation bias to sell us nonsense.
And once you buy in, that same bias will keep you in the dark.
[audience laughs]
I got this.
[audience laughs]
You know what, I need a minute.
[audience cheers] [narrator] Tell them how you really feel, Bill.
No, you think it's harmless.
Okay, you go to a psychic.
You watch Ghost Hunters.
You get somebody to read your tarot cards.
You look at crop circles and look for patterns.
You believe in aliens.
Yeah.
Six billion digital photos a week, and no one's ever seen a single unidentified flying object.
Oh, that's all right.
You'll be safe.
All you need's an aluminum hat, and crystal ball.
Or an 8 Ball.
Whoa. [chuckles]
Sorry, it seems to be glued down.
Or crystals that will heal you.
It's all crap.
None of it's true, and it wouldn't matter.
The thing is, people take your money.
Often when you're vulnerable, when you've had a death in the family, when you're concerned about something, that's when they prey on you.
They can't tell you the day you're gonna die by looking at your palm unless you're almost dead.
Hey, you got three minutes.
People, we want critical thinking skills.
We want you to understand the world around you through the process of science.
Don't be confirming your biases.
Question things.
[audience cheers]
I'm fine now.
[audience laughs]
But you don't have to believe me.
You don't have to believe me without any evidence because we have our super skeptical science sleuth Karlie Kloss out there.
Hot on the trails.
[audience cheering]
[Karlie] There are many wild theories about the billowing trails emitted by aircraft that decorate our skies.
[man 1] Look around.
Look at this.
[man 2] They're accelerating a plan, man.
[man 3] Why are they doing it?
[man 4] Jets.
Population control.
[man 5] Look up, people.
Look.
[Karlie] Chemical trails.
Is there any truth behind this speculation?
I decided to take my inquiry to Torrey Ward, a commercial pilot with over 11,000 hours of flight experience in more than 80 types of aircraft.
He should have a scientific explanation for what those mysterious streaks in the sky really are.
So, Torrey, these long white lines that are left in the sky after a jet flies through the air, is there any truth to the theory that there's chemicals that are released by the government?
Absolutely not.
-What about, to control minds?
-Nope.
Doesn't exist.
-Zombies?
-They are very much conspiracy theories.
It is a condensation trail.
Contrails are formed by, generally, aircraft at higher altitudes, where the temperature is cold enough and also moist enough.
Why do some contrails last for 30 minutes and some stay in the sky for hours?
The conditions to create this vapor trail, this contrail, are very magical.
It has to be cool, but it also has to be damp.
-So, too warm, no contrail.
-Okay.
Too cold, you might have contrail, but you also need to have moisture in the sky.
And as you get higher, then the air becomes drier.
And so even if a jet is flying through different conditions,
-at 30,000 feet--
-Yes.
There will be definitely areas where you won't see any trail at all.
And then you'll see thick trails.
And it's just as it flies through the moisture and temperature
-that helps create that.
-Okay.
[Karlie] There you have it.
Myth debunked.
Chemtrails, they're just not real.
[audience cheers]
Very cool.
Very cool.
[audience cheering]
Yeah, I know.
I learned a lot in this mission you sent me on.
Yeah.
So, uh, when you burn jet fuel or any fuel--
-I learnt this.
-You get carbon dioxide and water vapor.
-It's the by-product.
-You get water vapor, and sometimes, it turns to a cloud.
But the crazy thing is that it doesn't happen all the time.
And that's what I learned.
No.
That's why, you know... not every airplane that flies through the sky leaves a contrail.
It depends on the atmosphere.
It depends on the temperature.
It depends on the humidity.
It depends on how high or low it's flying.
And sometimes, it happens in certain times of the year.
And it's--
So, it's kind of just a "sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not."
But it's not chemicals that are controlling your brain by the government or by aliens.
-Can you imagine--?
-At least, as we know so far.
So far.
Here's what I say to people.
Imagine--
Look how difficult it is for people to work together to get anything done.
Let alone to subvert stuff.
Yeah, the government.
Yeah, they're really organized.
-Yeah, that's great.
-No, but, you know, the thing is, Bill, is that, you know,
I didn't know about these crazy conspiracy theories before looking into this, and the one thing that I realize is that these conspiracy theories, they kind of happen pretty easily.
You read something on the Internet, and you believe it as fact.
I think that's the biggest takeaway for me is I wanted to know, so I asked questions.
Did you enjoy flying around in a small plane?
So, I am six-foot-something and sitting in that plane, like, all curled up,
I felt like I was actually flying.
Cool.
I'm glad you had a good time.
Thanks for filing that report.
-I'm happy to debunk anything for you.
-Karlie Kloss.
Blow it up.
[audience cheers]
We are bombarded with pseudoscience every day.
But how do we stay skeptical without being too closed-minded?
Well, I'm here to discuss it with our distinguished panel.
Give it up... [audience cheering]
...for Timothy Caulfield, author of the book
Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?
[audience laughs]
Not some things, the whole deal.
-Sam Reynolds, you're an astrologer.
-[Sam] That's right.
-From Brooklyn, New York.
-That's right.
And, uh, Jamila Bey, you are a professional skeptic.
That indeed is so.
So, with all this, what is Gwyneth Paltrow wrong about everything?
She's wrong about an awful lot, Bill.
Uh, and she never disappoints me.
'Cause she has so many examples of pseudoscience.
And one of my absolute favorite is the vagina steam,
-which was her advice-- -[audience laughs]
We were all-
- Well, not all of us.
-[Bill] I'm not--
-A significant portion of us are supposed to steam our vagina for the purpose of detoxing.
-Which we call "second-degree burn."
-Yeah, exactly.
[audience laughs]
This idea that we have toxins residing in our bodies and we have to do all these crazy things to rid our bodies of these toxins.
You know, people have heard of cleanses.
Many celebrities suggest things like--
You know, there's Reiki to center your meridians.
There is grounding.
Have you heard of this?
Earth things.
You're supposed to walk on the ground.
You're supposed to lie on the ground, and you get the energy from the Earth--
-Or you get a nap.
-Yeah, you have a good nap.
Does she have astrological points of view?
She-
- I would suspect that she is very open-minded to the idea of astrology, but-
- Look, there's so much pseudoscience out there, particularly in the context of health, which is one thing I'm interested in because that can have real consequences.
-Now, Sam.
-[Sam] Yes, sir.
-You're an astrologer.
-That's right.
You know, I don't believe any of it.
Yes, I do know that.
And do you know why?
Tell me.
Enlighten me.
Well, it just never has anything to do with anything.
You're telling me there's only 12 types of people?
And what about the wobbling of the Earth and what used to be a Sagittarius is now-- What's the other one?
-Capricorn?
-Ophiuchus?
Oh, yes.
-Ophiuchus.
-That's me.
-You're the 13th sign.
-[Sam] There is no 13th sign.
-You would be under the 13th sign.
-Yes.
-But you're not.
-Which gives me superpowers.
-I could go invisible on you.
-[Sam] No.
-Really?
-Yeah.
[audience laughs]
But what's your deal?
You don't believe it either?
I use astrology.
I think astrology is like a language.
When you say, for instance, it's a pseudoscience, right?
I would have to first believe it's a science.
-I don't believe astrology is a science.
-[Bill] What is it?
-It's an interpretative art.
-An interpretative art.
As my friend, Shelley Ackerman describes it... it's the marriage between math and myth.
And that's how it's been for at least 5000 years.
The idea that we look at our cultural imagination with myth and mythological stories, and marry it to what we now know as science, in terms of astronomical phenomena.
So, what service do you provide for people with your art?
I use the cultural imagination that we know as astrology to talk to them about how their idea of themselves, based on their chart, their birth chart, syncs up with their life experience.
Basically, using biography... as a means--
In other words, you get them to tell you stuff about themselves
-and then you reinforce it...
-[Sam] No.
...with these astrological things in the background.
No, it's actually using the language of astrology as a means of talking with them about--
Dialoguing with them about their lives, about themselves.
So, it's a language.
-Jamila, you're a skeptic.
-[Jamila] I am.
How do you feel about this point of view?
Uh, I feel touchy-feely and weird and I want it replicated in a lab.
-I, you know--
-Yeah, can you make a prediction?
Sure, I can make a prediction.
But I don't think every aspect of knowledge has to be replicable...
-It does in science.
-...in a lab.
I don't think--
-In science, or a lab...
-So, is all knowledge... sequestered to science?
-No.
No.
-Okay.
Um, however... it's just, to me, you know-- I kind of take-
- I think it's fun.
I take that-
- I'm a Scorpio and--
-Do you know Carl?
-I like--
-Which Carl?
-He's a Scorpio.
-Oh.
-[audience laughs]
Okay.
You know, I think I might.
But, like-
- Oh, yeah, Carl.
Just like me, we like to fight and sex is fun for us.
-[Bill] That's so weird.
-Yeah.
I know.
But that's not astrology.
Astrology isn't just reducing people to 12 signs.
It's looking at the complex relationships between the planets, looking at the complex relationship between the signs.
It's not going just, like, by your horoscope.
People read their horoscopes and think, "Well, that's just all astrology can do."
That's entertainment.
Can you make my life better with astrology, in any way?
I mean...
How does Hamlet make your life better?
It entertains me.
It gives me insight into--
You know, it gives me some insight into human nature.
It allows me to look at a historical moment and perhaps infer ideas about the way people used to be, the way language once was.
Hamlet's good, but right now, I'm totally on a Hamilton kick.
That makes me tap my toes.
That makes me sing.
It's brought me closer to my own little boy who does "Guns and Ships" really well for an eight-year-old.
But here's the thing.
You-
- Astrology makes no provable predictions.
In fact, in our opinion...
Timothy, it's a little bit of a waste of time.
-But you make a living on it, right?
-Yes.
You make a good living.
-People come to you for advice, right?
-[Sam] Yes.
But, Timothy, you were gonna jump in.
I was.
I mean, what's interesting here is that... he's providing a service, and people think that they're getting something from him.
And that builds on something that you said earlier.
It's these cognitive biases that we have that allow this kind of pseudoscience to thrive.
It's the causal illusion, right, that he makes some kind of prediction, something happens, and some have suggested that kind of causal illusion is the foundation of pseudoscience.
Whether you're talking about Wi-Fi causing cancer, whether you're talking about this kind of phenomenon, whether you're really talking about almost any kind--
What's the first thing I said...
about astrology?
-It's not science.
-There you go.
I'm gonna come onto your side, a little bit.
-Can I come onto your side?
-All right, come on over.
I like the fact that you're saying, it's not science.
'Cause, Bill, a horrible trend that's happening right now is people are claiming things like this are science.
Of what use is it?
That's what I'm saying.
It's the same use as any kind of art.
It touches the imagination, it touches the human heart.
People can relate to some things that are said through astrology, just like they relate to seeing a film, just like they relate through poetry.
It's celestial poetry.
It's seeing the stars come alive as it relates to your heart.
Gotta say... as a, uh... scientifically literate guy, or I try to be... when you realize what's really happening in the universe, what's really happening in the cosmos, it's far more inspiring.
You're looking for data.
You're looking at it in terms--
-I'm looking for beauty, in this case.
-But human beings relate to meaning.
One last thing for me.
[Sam] Mm-hm.
What makes people skeptical of climate change?
-What happens to people?
-They don't understand it.
-They don't understand it.
Yeah.
-Lack of education.
How do you deal with people who are believers?
I deal with them as people.
You know, you ask people, you know...
One of-
- I'm not gonna name them, but, you know, in the halls of our Congress, in Washington D.C., holding a snowball:
"There's snow.
Can't be no global warming."
[audience laughs]
So, it's-
- My claim is that lack of discipline, lack of searching for true cause and effect, is inherently bad.
It's bad for you.
The just moseying around, trying to figure things out, and claiming there are connections which are provably unconnected, is troubling for us on the skeptical side.
With that said, thank you all very much.
-Let's have a hand for our panel.
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Bill.
-[Bill] Tim, Sam and Jamila.
[audience cheers]
Hi, Dr. Mesmer.
[audience laughs]
Some people claim that through the power of mind over matter, with mental and spiritual strength... you can walk across coals without getting burned.
[audience laughs]
But we're scientists... and that's... ridiculous.
So, let's be skeptical and try to prove it wrong.
[audience cheers]
-Donald Faison.
-Hi.
-So good to see you, man.
-Bill Nye.
-You're all suited up.
-I, uh...
I heard I was coming into your lab, so I, uh...
-[Bill] I love you, man.
-I dressed up for you.
Put on a...
This is my least favorite coat rack.
And now we look exactly alike.
Oh, yeah.
People can hardly tell us apart.
I am your black doppelganger.
So, here's what I want you to do.
I want you to consider... the following.
This, you may recognize, as an ordinary skull with a hole in its head.
-And a candle.
-Oh, that's right.
-It has a candle in it.
-And a candle, yes.
So, here's an interesting thing.
Here's how people walk on hot coals.
First, they light a candle.
Oh, this is-
- Yeah.
This is adult resistant.
[audience laughs]
Oh, we got quite a breeze here, Donald.
-Let me help you out there.
-There you go, man.
-Thank you.
-There you go.
Look at the breeze, okay?
Nobody leave this room.
Hang on here.
Let's see if we can pull this off.
Wait, wait.
No, this is gonna be great.
Here we are.
All right.
Now...
-Do you want me to hold it there?
-Now try holding it over the flame.
-We'll count.
One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.
-[Donald] There we go.
-[Bill] Don't let it-
- It's up to you.
But it went about four-and-a-half or five.
-I'd say about four-and-a-half seconds--
-Four-and-a-half seconds, yeah, yeah.
-Whoo!
-[audience laughing]
Woo-hoo-hoo.
But now...
I'm already nervous for what's gonna happen next, man.
Do you wanna try this one or you want me to do it?
No, no, no, I'll do it, I'll do it.
So, we have wrapped the same piece of paper--
Or from the other half.
--around this ordinary aluminum can.
Now hold it over the same flame and I will block it in the same fashion.
One, two, three... four...
-five, six.
-Five, six, seven, eight... nine.
So, my claim is you can be here for quite a while.
-Thirty seconds, anyway.
-The can's getting warm.
But the can's getting warm.
So, what's happening is the heat... is passing right through the paper... into the can.
This is how fire walking works.
It's not mental or spiritual preparedness.
Anyone can do it.
Because your feet, the meat of your feet... absorb the energy of the fire without burning.
-What?
[laughs]
-It's amazing.
Then the second thing is, uh... wood, even when it's on fire, doesn't conduct heat that well.
You know how you stir spaghetti with a wooden spoon rather than a metal one?
And then the other thing that happens, your feet get, uh... cold because when you're nervous, you ever felt this vaso-- constriction of your veins, your hands get cold?
And then the big one is you wet the area around the fire, like, wet.
So, the first couple steps... the liquid water on your feet turns to steam.
So, that buys you another couple steps.
But you can't just, like, stand in hot coals.
-You can't just stand, but you can walk.
-Or run.
Another trick, yeah, motor.
Get her done.
Now, I'm not kidding.
It looks like an effect that could not possibly work.
-But I claim it does.
-Okay.
And what we're gonna do is see if we can prove me wrong.
Are you up for it?
-What I'm saying here--
-I want you to be correct.
'Cause I have a feeling I'm gonna be the guinea pig in this situation.
-Well, I'll go right... after you.
-After?
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, here's the strange thing, you guys.
We have prepared a big fire.
[audience cheers]
And we're gonna go out there and try walking on it.
Are you with us?
[audience cheering]
-It's gonna be cool.
-I'm so excited!
Uh...
-let's go.
-Let's go.
-This way?
-Yeah.
You look great.
[cheering]
[Bill laughs]
-You can do this.
-No.
You can do this.
You're feeling it.
You can do this.
A bed of flaming coals.
You can feel the heat... the heat back here.
You can feel the heat, everybody?
It's cool.
Or it's hot.
Yes, yes.
The heat is mak-- It's moving my hair.
It's moving your laboratory coat.
-So...
-Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys.
So, we're ready to go, right?
-Oh, my God, you guys.
-Now, we have...
-I'm good.
I'm ready to go.
-Fearless.
Fearless.
Fearless.
What's our temperature?
We're below a thousand, probably.
-How much?
-What?
-A thousand degrees.
-Above a thousand degrees.
A thousand Fahrenheit.
That says, 90-
- Uh, yeah, it's hot.
[laughter]
So, if I understand this, we're supposed to walk with intentionality.
-How are you doing?
-I'm great.
Yeah.
You look great.
One, two, three, four, five.
[cheering]
[Donald] Wow.
[Bill] Go a little faster than that.
[cheering]
One, two, three, four.
Cool.
[screams] [audience cheers]
[Bill] So, uh, do you feel empowered?
To be honest with you, I felt some heat... on my feet.
[laughs]
-That's cool.
Way to go, man.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, Donald... having experienced the candle flame, and the can and the paper... do you feel that there is spiritual preparedness, that there's some sort of empowerment, that comes from some psychic force that enabled you to do that?
Or was it just... science?
Do I feel empowered?
Uh, yeah.
Do I feel like it's because of science?
-Yeah.
-I love you, man.
Be skeptical out there and question things, and together, we can, dare I say it... save the world.
Thanks, everybody.
[theme music playing]
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.
Okay, so, break it down.
How did it happen?
Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
Barry sang to me.
- And then he proposed.
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.
Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...
- ... to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?
On the house.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?
Uh, yeah, we're interested.
When?
First weekend in July.
Um, July.
Y... does that not work for you guys?
Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!
Don't do this!
Please?
I'm begging you!
Just...
Barry!
You lose, Barry.
No!
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.
Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.
I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.
It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
- Well, all bar one.
- _
It's a crime scene.
We gotta go.
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.
Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.
- Yeah.
Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?
Okay.
I'll keep working on it.
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...
I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
Yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.
Great, thanks.
Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.
That's two in under 12 hours.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.
I don't think that's yours, pal.
Flash.
You didn't think I'd want to come meet the newest resident of Iron Heights?
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.
Hmm.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
"... indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
Oh.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?
Oh, this guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good. remove it.
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
- Ahh.
- Ohh!
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
Mm-hmm.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Ah!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
Oh, there have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palm's are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...
I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
Mm, next time you operate on me, maybe you can... my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two meta-humans from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.
- We had the...
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
You gotta let somebody know next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.
Who was worried about me?
He was.
I'm touched.
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.
Is that lime Jell-O?
It's all you, H.R.
Are you serious?
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
I...
love the lime.
I love the lime!
You were really worried about him, weren't you?
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.
Cross my heart and hope to...
Caitlin?
Hey!
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
Somebody help!
W-w-what happened?
What happened?
I don't know, she just started seizing.
Hold her down, hold her down.
Hey, H.R., grab her legs.
Hold her down!
What... what's happening?
She's not breathing.
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.
Wheel it over here!
Slow and steady, over her mouth.
Okay, good.
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.
- That's it.
- What's happening?
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...
Give it here.
Clear.
All the way, turn it up to the top!
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.
Char... go.
Keep going.
Come on, Caitlin, come on!
Keep going, just keep going.
Uh, here, take this.
Here we go, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yes, she is.
Come on.
Here she comes.
Come on!
Don't stop.
Please.
Please don't stop.
She's gone.
Stop!
That's not what she wanted!
I don't care!
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?
Okay?
It's all right, mate, it's okay.
It's okay.
Caitlin?
Huh.
Caitlin.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.
Okay, so, break it down.
How did it happen?
Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
Barry sang to me.
- And then he proposed.
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.
Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...
- ... to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?
On the house.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?
Uh, yeah, we're interested.
When?
First weekend in July.
Um, July.
Y... does that not work for you guys?
Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!
Don't do this!
Please?
I'm begging you!
Just...
Barry!
You lose, Barry.
No!
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.
Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.
I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.
It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
- Well, all bar one.
- _
It's a crime scene.
We gotta go.
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.
Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.
- Yeah.
Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?
Okay.
I'll keep working on it.
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...
I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
Yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.
Great, thanks.
Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.
That's two in under 12 hours.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.
I don't think that's yours, pal.
Flash.
You didn't think I'd want to come meet the newest resident of Iron Heights?
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.
Hmm.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
"... indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
Oh.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?
Oh, this guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good. remove it.
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
- Ahh.
- Ohh!
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
Mm-hmm.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Ah!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
Oh, there have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palm's are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...
I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
Mm, next time you operate on me, maybe you can... my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two meta-humans from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.
- We had the...
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
You gotta let somebody know next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.
Who was worried about me?
He was.
I'm touched.
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.
Is that lime Jell-O?
It's all you, H.R.
Are you serious?
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
I...
love the lime.
I love the lime!
You were really worried about him, weren't you?
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.
Cross my heart and hope to...
Caitlin?
Hey!
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
Somebody help!
W-w-what happened?
What happened?
I don't know, she just started seizing.
Hold her down, hold her down.
Hey, H.R., grab her legs.
Hold her down!
What... what's happening?
She's not breathing.
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.
Wheel it over here!
Slow and steady, over her mouth.
Okay, good.
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.
- That's it.
- What's happening?
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...
Give it here.
Clear.
All the way, turn it up to the top!
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.
Char... go.
Keep going.
Come on, Caitlin, come on!
Keep going, just keep going.
Uh, here, take this.
Here we go, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yes, she is.
Come on.
Here she comes.
Come on!
Don't stop.
Please.
Please don't stop.
She's gone.
Stop!
That's not what she wanted!
I don't care!
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?
Okay?
It's all right, mate, it's okay.
It's okay.
Caitlin?
Huh.
Caitlin.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.
Okay, so, break it down.
How did it happen?
Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
Barry sang to me.
And then he proposed.
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.
Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...
- ... to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?
On the house.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?
Uh, yeah, we're interested.
When?
First weekend in July.
Um, July.
Y... does that not work for you guys?
Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!
Don't do this!
Please?
I'm begging you!
Just...
Barry!
You lose, Barry.
No!
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.
Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.
I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.
It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
- Well, all bar one.
- _
It's a crime scene.
We gotta go.
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.
Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.
- Yeah.
Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?
Okay.
I'll keep working on it.
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...
I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
Yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.
Great, thanks.
Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.
That's two in under 12 hours.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.
I don't think that's yours, pal.
Flash.
You didn't think I'd want to come meet the newest resident of Iron Heights?
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.
Hmm.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
"... indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy-Vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
Oh.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?
Oh, this guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers have we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good. remove it.
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
- Ahh.
- Ohh!
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
Mm-hmm.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Ah!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
Oh, there have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palm's are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...
I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
Mm, next time you operate on me, maybe you can... fix my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two meta-humans from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.

Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?

Who was worried about me?
He was.

You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.

Ah, ha ha ha ha!

Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
[groans] You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
[groans] I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
[groans]
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
[footsteps approaching]
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
[sighs]
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
[scoffs] I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers have we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
[sighs]
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.

I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.
Hmm.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
"... indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy-Vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
Oh.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?
Oh, this guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers have we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good. remove it.
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
- Ahh.
- Ohh!
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
Mm-hmm.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Ah!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
Oh, there have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palm's are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...
I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
Mm, next time you operate on me, maybe you can... fix my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two metas from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.
- We had the...
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
You gotta let somebody know next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.
Who was worried about me?
He was.
I'm touched.
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.
Is that lime Jell-O?
It's all you, H.R.
Are you serious?
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
I...
love the lime.
I love the lime!
You were really worried about him, weren't you?
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.
Cross my heart and hope to...
Caitlin?
Hey!
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
Somebody help!
W-w-what happened?
What happened?
I don't know, she just started seizing.
Hold her down, hold her down.
Hey, H.R., grab her legs.
Hold her down!
What... what's happening?
She's not breathing.
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.
Wheel it over here!
Slow and steady, over her mouth.
Okay, good.
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.
- That's it.
- What's happening?
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...
Give it here.
Clear.
All the way, turn it up to the top!
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.
Char... go.
Keep going.
Come on, Caitlin, come on!
Keep going, just keep going.
Uh, here, take this.
Here we go, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yes, she is.
Come on.
Here she comes.
Come on!
Don't stop.
Please.
Please don't stop.
She's gone.
Stop!
That's not what she wanted!
I don't care!
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?
Okay?
It's all right, mate, it's okay.
It's okay.
Caitlin?
Huh.
Caitlin.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal.
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
Yeah, he did.
Okay, so, break it down.
How did it happen?
Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
Barry sang to me.
And then he proposed.
My God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.
Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...
- to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?
On the house.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?
Yeah, we're interested.
When?
First weekend in July.
Um, July.
Y... does that not work for you guys?
Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!
Don't do this!
Please?
I'm begging you!
Just...
Barry!
You lose, Barry.
No!
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.
Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.
I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.
It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
- Well, all bar one.
- _.
It's a crime scene.
We gotta go.
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.
Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.
- Yeah.
Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?
Okay.
I'll keep working on it.
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...
I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
Yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.
Great, thanks.
Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.
That's two in under 12 hours.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.
I don't think that's yours, pal.
Flash.
You didn't think I'd want to come meet the newest resident of Iron Heights?
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, 2017.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is..."
"indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
That wasn't very smart, was it?
This guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good.
Remove it.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
My God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build.
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
There have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palm's are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...
I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
Next time you operate on me, maybe you can... my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two meta-humans from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.
- We had the...
- Okay.
My God.
Stop talking.
You gotta let somebody know next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.
Who was worried about me?
He was.
I'm touched.
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.
Is that lime Jell-O?
It's all you, H.R.
Are you serious?
Ha ha ha ha!
I...
love the lime.
I love the lime!
You were really worried about him, weren't you?
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.
Cross my heart and hope to...
Caitlin?
Hey!
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
Somebody help!
W-w-what happened?
What happened?
I don't know, she just started seizing.
Hold her down, hold her down.
Hey, H.R., grab her legs.
Hold her down!
What... what's happening?
She's not breathing.
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.
Wheel it over here!
Slow and steady, over her mouth.
Okay, good.
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.
- That's it.
- What's happening?
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...
Give it here.
Clear.
All the way, turn it up to the top!
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.
Char... go.
Keep going.
Come on, Caitlin, come on!
Keep going, just keep going.
Here, take this.
Here we go, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yes, she is.
Come on.
Here she comes.
Come on!
Don't stop.
Please.
Please don't stop.
She's gone.
Stop!
That's not what she wanted!
I don't care!
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?
Okay?
It's all right, mate, it's okay.
It's okay.
Caitlin?
Caitlin.
Barry:
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
♪ ♪
*THE FLASH* Season 03 Episode 18 "Abra Kadabra"
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.
Okay, so, break it down.
How did it happen?
Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
Barry sang to me.
And then he proposed.
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.
Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...
- to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?
On the house.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?
Uh, yeah, we're interested.
When?
First weekend in July.
Um, July.
Y... does that not work for you guys?
Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!
Don't do this!
Please?
I'm begging you!
Just...
Barry!
You lose, Barry.
No!
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.
Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.
I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.
It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
Well, all bar one.
It's a crime scene.
We gotta go.
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.
Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"

As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
Both: "indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.

Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.
- Yeah.
Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?
Okay.
I'll keep working on it.
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...
I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
Yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.
Great, thanks.
Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.
That's two in under 12 hours.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.
I don't think that's yours, pal.
Flash.
You didn't think I'd want to come meet the newest resident of Iron Heights?
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.
Hmm.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
"... indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy-Vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
Oh.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?
Oh, this guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers have we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good. remove it.
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
- Ahh.
- Ohh!
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
Mm-hmm.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Ah!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
Oh, there have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palm's are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, and then I...
I would just sit there there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.
Mm, next time you operate on me, maybe you can... fix my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two meta-humans from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.
- We had the...
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
You gotta let somebody know next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.
Who was worried about me?
He was.
I'm touched.
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.
Is that lime Jell-O?
It's all you, H.R.
Are you serious?
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
I...
love the lime.
I love the lime!
You were really worried about him, weren't you?
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.
Cross my heart and hope to...
Caitlin?
Hey!
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
Somebody help!
W-w-what happened?
What happened?
I don't know, she just started seizing.
Hold her down, hold her down.
Hey, H.R., grab her legs.
Hold her down!
What... what's happening?
She's not breathing.
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.
Wheel it over here!
Slow and steady, over her mouth.
Okay, good.
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.
- That's it.
- What's happening?
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...
Give it here.
Clear.
All the way, turn it up to the top!
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.
Char... go.
Keep going.
Come on, Caitlin, come on!
Keep going, just keep going.
Uh, here, take this.
Here we go, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yes, she is.
Come on.
Here she comes.
Come on!
Don't stop.
Please.
Please don't stop.
She's gone.
Stop!
That's not what she wanted!
I don't care!
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?
Okay?
It's all right, mate, it's okay.
It's okay.
Caitlin?
Huh.
Caitlin.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.
Okay, so, break it down.
How did it happen?
Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
Barry sang to me.
And then he proposed.
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.
Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...
- ... to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?
On the house.
I thought that maybe we could make it a double if you guys were interested?
Uh, yeah, we're interested.
When?
First weekend in July.
Um, July.
Y... does that not work for you guys?
Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!
Don't do this!
Please?
I'm begging you!
Just...
Barry!
You lose, Barry.
No!
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.
Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.
Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.
I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.
It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
- Well, all bar one.
- _
It's a crime scene.
We gotta go.
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.
Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thought so.
He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.
Watch.
I don't know that he will, Cisco.
Hey, Bar.
Anything?
Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.
- Yeah.
Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?
Okay.
I'll keep working on it.
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...
I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
Yeah, I know.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.
Great, thanks.
Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.
That's two in under 12 hours.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.
I don't think that's yours, pal.
Flash.
You didn't think I'd want to come meet the newest resident of Iron Heights?
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,
Barry...
Allen.
Now, how do you know who I am?
I'm from the future.
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.
Hmm.
How are things going with your doomed love,
Iris West?
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
You know Savitar.
I know everything about him, and you.
What the...
Gypsy.
Still seeking revenge, I see.
I'm gonna get it this time.
We'll see.
No!
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
"... indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?
Why?
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy-Vibe action.
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.
We can help you do that.
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.
I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?
I mean, if she gets ahold of him, she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.
I got nothing.
Why can't I find you?
I told you, this guy is smart.
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him, then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?
What are you doing?
I'm putting some search parameters into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency than Earth-1 folk.
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.
Oh.
I could hook you up, girl.
How about this,
I spend a few days on Earth-19, and set you up with something state-of-the-art.
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so.
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.
That kiss, that wasn't
"I'll see you around."
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."
Or did I misread that?
I-I-I've been preoccupied.
Is that the only reason?
Great timing!
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.
Let's grab the speedsters and go.
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?
You brought the whole team this time.
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?
Oh, this guy sucks.
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.
Do yourself a favor, give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.
I think I just did.
He's a hologram.
Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.
But what's it made out of?
Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.
Frankly, it's...
Beyond your understanding.
You make a move, you'll regret it.
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?
Told you.
Damn it.
Go, go, go!
Guys, move to the side.
Now...
I can get what I came for.
Everybody okay?
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.
Maybe not.
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
- What secret?
- I know who he is.
I know his name.
Hand him over!
Why'd you lock him up?
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.
Fine.
Get what you need from him, but when you're done, he's mine.
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.
Gypsy, darling?
You said you know who Savitar is.
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.
Like what?
That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...
Iris West.
Tell us who he is, now!
I don't think so.
It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.
All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.
And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
It's simple.
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.
The decision lies with you, Barry.
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him before we find out who Savitar is.
No, we cannot.
Then what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
What is it with you and this guy?
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.
Is that what this is about?
What this is about, Cisco, is he needs to be brought to justice, and I am not gonna let anything or anyone prevent me from doing that.
You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.
I'm fine, really.
It's merely a flesh wound, as the "Monty Python" boys would say.
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.
Of course.
Listen, I've been trying to find the right time to say this, and... now seems to be as good a time as any.
I was so focused on not hurting you... as Killer Frost... that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow, and for that I'm very sorry.
So I understand... if you don't trust me anymore, but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
You're good to go.
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers have we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.
No, you can save my life.
Not him.
Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.
And you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.
What do you want?
To be set free.
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.
Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.
This is about my daughter's life.
It's as simple as that for me.
You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.
A leap of faith for us both then.
Open the door.
If you take one step before you tell me,
I will blow you away.
Understood?
But you do not know this guy.
Great timing!
What is that?
- No.
- Gypsy!
Give me the name.
The name, now!
Savitar... is...
No!
What the hell are you doing?
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!
Damn it!
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!
And there we are.
Thank you, Doctor Wells.
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!
We had a deal.
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.
I've altered the terms of our agreement.
It appears that you have as well.
Move!
Caitlin!
Caitlin, are you all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- I'm okay.
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay, okay, easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Gentle, gentle.
Yeah, yeah, yup.
The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine,
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.
Here, here.
Okay, good.
Remove it.
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you, and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney if they're not removed immediately.
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.
And not just any meta.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.
Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.
We do have another option.
What is it?
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.
She can regenerate?
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
What?
No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake during your own surgery.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.
What the hell were you thinking?
Now is not the time, Gypsy.
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.
Guess which one takes priority?
That was my prisoner.
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.
He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!
It's because of you he's on the loose.
Because of me?
No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!
How much of that did you hear?
I heard enough.
This is my friend.
It's the man's daughter.
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?
I am doing that, you idiot!
Okay, what does that mean?
For who?
Who are you talking about?
I used to have a partner.
Like, a "partner" or... like a partner?
Both.
It was a long time ago, Cisco.
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but he did mean something to me.
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.
I'm sorry.
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.
So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.
No more delays.
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
Okay, let's start with the shrapnel on the surface.
Okey-dokey.
Just let me know if I do any... thing wrong, okay?
Okay, that's the first bit.
Well done.
Okay.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is there supposed to be this much blood?
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, nearly done, nearly done, hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, well done.
Well done, that's all the pieces of shrapnel from the surface gone.
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.
But you're doing great.
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.
If you hit them, there's a good chance
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?
But it's okay.
You've got this.
Okay.
All right.
Heart rate's increasing.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Great, pull it out.
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.
Then turn it.
Guys, it's getting up there.
It might be a tendon in the way.
If it's not a tendon...
Then I will rip this necklace off.
No!
I would rather die.
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.
- Ahh.
- Ohh!
Can you please stitch me up, because I think I need to pass out?
Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.
She's gonna be all right.
Thank God.
That really was amazing, Julian.
Seriously.
Julian Albert, MD.
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.
- Why?
- Build a time machine.
He's trying to get back to the future.
Presto.
What is that thing in his hands?
Everything Kadabra's been stealing, these are the exact components I used to build
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago, but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.
I think this is it.
So that's what he took from the time vault, its power source?
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.
Well, we need to find his ass before he pulls another disappearing act.
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself back to the future...
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.
Mm-hmm.
No, he's mine.
I look forward to showing him the same mercy he showed my partner.
Hey, Gypsy.
You can't go after him alone.
Sure I can.
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt, for your partner, right?
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.
I don't trust you guys anymore.
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.
He does it again through time,
I don't think we get this opportunity back.
Only way we catch him is together.
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.
He opened up a wormhole.
What do you say?
We can't let him get past us.
We're not gonna do that.
Catch me if you can.
Where's he at?
He's on State and Main!
We're on it!
You shall not pass!
Ah!
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!
You gotta stop this guy.
Time to go home.
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!
Yes!
He did it, he got him.
Thank God.
So much for your disappearing act.
No!
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.
Let her take me.
You'll never find out what I know.
And Iris dies.
You've come to see me off.
I'm really touched.
What are we gonna do here?
You're going with her.
I'm not gonna stop her.
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.
I have nothing to offer you.
No reprieve.
No escape for what you're facing.
You've done some terrible things.
But you are still a man.
You have a family, friends, people that you care about.
Somewhere inside of you there must be a glimmer of light, of hope.
It's that part of you that I'm asking.
I'm begging.
Help me save her.
Flash.
Begging.
See, here it is.
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.
Oh, there have been others, of course.
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe, but none of them hurt you like Savitar.
He truly broke you.
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.
Where does this leave us?
I don't know.
Cisco, I...
Hey.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.
Kadabra?
He's gone.
He's gone for good, apparently.
Sorry.
My palms are sweaty.
It's quite all right.
Honestly, my stitch work may leave quite a lot to be desired, so.
It's okay.
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit kind of gal anyway.
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery, that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands through it, that's quite the other.
You are immensely brave.
You fought through the pain like I've never seen anyone before.
You did all the hard work.
Hardly.
You going soft on me, Julian?
Yes.
Absolutely.
I'm so terribly sorry.
That's most clumsy of me.
Some bedside manner you got there.
I'm working on it.
Just rest.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Easy.
Sorry.
I should've been stronger.
You think you should've shot Kadabra?
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.
I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.
Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.
When you were a baby, I was...
I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.
I just didn't sleep.
I would just... sit in your room... and watch you sleep.
I put my hand on your chest, just to make sure you were breathing, in and out...
I would just sit there, praying that... you'd just keep breathing.
That's how I feel right now.
I don't know what I can do to save you.
I know how to save her.
What?
I know how to save her.
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.
You know, they're always one step ahead of us... for one reason... they know what's gonna happen.
So every move we make, every trap we try and set, it's all just history to them.
They're armed with the future.
Well, not anymore.
What does that mean?
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
I'm gonna run to the future.
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?
I just bought some, like, a week ago.
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some, slash... all.
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?
I will get you more.
No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkis, mister.
Mm, next time you operate on me, maybe you can... fix my broken heart.
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
If two metas from two different universes with the same vibrational powers can't make it work, then... what hope is there?
There you guys are.
I've been looking all over for... what are you doing in bed?
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.
- We had the...
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
You gotta let somebody know next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.
Who was worried about me?
He was.
I'm touched.
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer the next time you pull something like that.
Guys, stop it.
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.
Is that lime Jell-O?
It's all you, H.R.
Are you serious?
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
I...
love the lime.
I love the lime!
You were really worried about him, weren't you?
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.
Cross my heart and hope to...
Caitlin?
Hey!
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
Somebody help!
W-w-what happened?
What happened?
I don't know, she just started seizing.
Hold her down, hold her down.
Hey, H.R., grab her legs.
Hold her down!
What... what's happening?
She's not breathing.
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.
Wheel it over here!
Slow and steady, over her mouth.
Okay, good.
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.
- That's it.
- What's happening?
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...
Give it here.
Clear.
All the way, turn it up to the top!
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.
Char... go.
Keep going.
Come on, Caitlin, come on!
Keep going, just keep going.
Uh, here, take this.
Here we go, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yes, she is.
Come on.
Here she comes.
Come on!
Don't stop.
Please.
Please don't stop.
She's gone.
Stop!
That's not what she wanted!
I don't care!
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?
Okay?
It's all right, mate, it's okay.
It's okay.
Caitlin?
Huh.
Caitlin.
Barry:
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.
I'm Cisco, by the way.
You must be Gypsy.
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.
I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
[both laughing]
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
[alarm blaring]
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...
I doubt you'll have time.
[dramatic music] [both screaming]
♪ ♪ [upbeat pop music]
It's just beautiful.
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.
Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.

How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
[sighs] What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"

Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.
No one's saying a thing.
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.

- Okay.

- Do you wanna go get a condom?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
[both chuckle]
- [whirring] - [both chuckle]
[Mickey moaning]
Hey, can I get your Wi-Fi password?
Oh!
Getting a little ahead of yourself.
Aren't you, mister?
Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?
Yeah, I watched half that Edward Snowden documentary.
- And now I'm very careful.
- [chuckles] Seriously?
- No, it's just easier if I type it in.
- Oh, right. [sniffles]
Hey, I liked waking up next to you this morning.
You're a peaceful sleeper.
I like it.
Oh, yeah, I go into, like, a super deep trance zone.
- Yeah.
- You are not a peaceful sleeper.
- Oh, no?
- You were very chatty.
[groans] Fuck.
I've heard that before.
What did I say?
You were like, "I'm sorry, Brenda Blethyn."
- And then you started laughing.
- [laughs]
I laughed?
Well, that's super creepy.
Mmm, it was.
But I liked it.
This is nice.
Yeah.
Wish we could just stay in bed all day.
- Why don't we, huh?
You got any plans?
- [sighs] [smacks lips] I really want to, I do.
But I gotta go to SLAA.
SLAA.
S-L-A-A, that's what they call it.
Ah!
SLAA.
- I get it.
That makes sense.
- Yep.
What time is it?
[inhales] Now-ish?
Sorry.
- It's okay.
- [inhales deeply]
It's good that you're going.
Seriously.
You should go.
Go, go, go.
Do you want, like... a fresh T-shirt or something?
[grunts] No, I'm good.
Thanks.
You sure?
You ran, like, three miles last night.
Yeah?
[sniffs] Ugh!
I'm a little ripe.
- Here, this one should fit.
- Okay.
[sighs]
- I'm not tripping still, am I?
- You tell me.
[chuckles] I'm not.
- Oh, that looks cute on you.
- Thank you.
Hey, you know, you could come with me if you want to.
Really?
Is that cool?
- Yeah.
- Like, go into the meeting, or...
No.
Wait for me outside.
Yeah!
Sure, if that's cool.
As long as you won't get bored.
No.
I'll just... hang out in my car, watch videos of kids coming out from under anesthesia.
Have you ever seen those?
Uh, really, it's funny, seeing fucked-up kids.
- [snorts] - [Gus chuckles]
Ugh.
I hate all my clothes. [scoffs]
[sighs]
Mom, how's it goin'?
Is Dad around?
An estate sale?
That's cool.
This is embarrassing, but I don't remember your name.
[scoffs]
Jorie.
J-O-R-I-E.
- Short for Marjorie.
Just call whenever.
- Amazing.
Thank you, I will.
Okay... this may be against the rules or whatever, but...
Yeah?
What's up?
I hung out with this guy last night... and now I really wanna spend the day with him.
Is that not cool?
Should I not do that?
All right, well, were you honest with him about SLAA?
- Yeah.
- And he's cool with it?
Yeah.
I mean, don't look now, but he's waiting for me in the car.
He's almost too cool with it.
Yeah.
Just hang out with him.
Really?
'Cause I don't wanna binge on him.
I...
I wanna do this right for once.
The program is about learning to be in a healthy relationship.
And just because you are new doesn't mean you have to walk away from something good because of bad timing.
Fuck timing.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I gotta go to spin class.
The road to self-improvement is never ending.
- Bye, Jorie.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How's it going?
How was the meeting?
Or, uh, can I not...
I don't know what I'm allowed to ask.
- It was good.
- Good.
- Thank you for asking.
- Good.
Of course.
Cool.
Did you, uh, make some new friends?
- Yes, Mom.
- [both chuckle]
All right. [chuckles]
I just wanna know about you and your new friends.
If they're coming over, let me know, and I'll pick up some sodas beforehand.
Do you, uh... wanna get some food?
Yeah.
A little brunch action?
Yeah.
We can do that.
Sure.
[sniggers]
What?
I just saw you do your mirror face.
- My mirror face?
What is it?
- It was like this.
[chuckling] Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I look sexy in the mirror.
- [laughing]
- I gotta know how I look.
Oh, just you wait.
There's gonna come a day when I catch you doin' your mirror face.
I am gonna relish that shit.
[Mickey] Oh, my God.
- You see that building right there?
- Uh-huh.
That's where my first job in LA was.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
I was an assistant to this publicist who repped the entire cast of The Hills.
Oh, that's cool.
Mmm, no.
Too much drama.
Isn't that the point of the show?
Drama?
Not in real life.
Not when Justin Bobby shows up at your house in the middle of the night crying 'cause he's the only one who wasn't included in the spread in Teen Vogue.
[chuckles]
Oh, Justin Bobby.
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
No.
- That makes me like you so much more.
- [chuckles softly] Good.
[Mickey] Do you ever think,
"What would I do if there was an earthquake right now?"
[Gus] Oh, yeah, all the time.
I guarantee you and me will experience, like, a huge earthquake at some point in our lives.
- Really?
The big one?
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Because think about it.
We haven't had, like, a true crisis in Los Angeles in years.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
- In the '90s, there were the riots, the Northridge earthquakes, OJ.
- So we're due up for disaster.
- [inhales sharply]
Well, if there is an apocalyptic event, I will not be helpful.
I will almost certainly make things worse.
Mmm.
Stick with me, then, 'cause I have a good plan if there's a disaster.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
- Immediately kill myself.
- [Mickey] Mmm.
Smart.
How you gonna do it?
[Gus] Hmm, jump off the roof of The Grove parking lot.
So you didn't grow up with, like, a dream of becoming a teacher?
No.
No.
I didn't really wanna be a teacher.
I was always, like, obsessed with, like,
TV shows and movies and stuff.
I even memorized which studios made which movies.
Oh, my God, why?
To impress girls, obviously.
Forrest Gump.
[gasps] Okay, uh, Paramount.
- Mmm.
Se7en.
- New Line.
- Um, Fast and the Furious.
- Universal.
- First Wives Club.
- Paramount.
- Silence of the Lambs.
- Orion.
- La Dolce Vita.
- [inhales sharply]
Did you say, "Cocktail"?
Is that what I heard?
"Cocktail"?
Touchstone.
- Still impressive.
- Thank you.
Plus, I feel like I just got a window into the life of 14-year-old Gus.
Yikes!
Gus Cru-shek?
- Oh, right here.
- Hey.
- Are you not gonna correct her?
- That's close enough.
[boy] I don't wanna go to swim class.
[man] You have to go.
We already paid for it.
Cost 300 bucks for that whole package.
That's $50 for each one.
- [woman] Why don't you want to go...
- Makes sense.
That is such a classic, passive-aggressive dad move.
That reminds me of my dad when we'd go out in public and he'd yell at us.
- You know, just restrained and angry.
- Really?
Yeah.
I mean, usually it was about how, like... [inhales deeply] we shouldn't get dessert at the restaurant because we have plenty of ice cream at home, sort of thing.
- Yeah.
- But still, very mad.
We always ordered dessert, no question.
Oh, really?
You guys were a real, uh, Richie Rich family, huh?
We were kind of rich when my dad was still employed.
Hmm.
Yeah, we were strictly middle class, baby!
[both chuckle]
But if we had lived in a big city, you know, like, LA or New York, we would've been totally dirt poor.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Especially with four kids, so...
- Did you have siblings?
- Just one.
My brother Bob.
- Bobby Dobby.
- Bobby Dobb.
And, uh, what's, uh... [sighs] What's Bobby Dobby do now?
Lives in Tucson.
He's got two kids, Lilian and...
Fuck, I can never remember the boy's name.
- Your nephew?
- [gasps]
- You don't remember your nephew's name?
- Oh, okay.
In my defense, he's, like, three years old, so he hasn't made that big of an impression on me.
And the last time I saw him, he told me that my head looked like a butt.
[both chuckle softly]
What about you?
Older or younger, your siblings?
Oh, both. [inhales sharply]
I have an older brother, uh, Ken, who's the perfect kid.
- Wait.
You're not the perfect child?
- No.
- What?
- Uh, yeah, he, like...
He still lives in my hometown, Brookings, with his family, so my parents love him.
I mean, that makes sense.
And then, I have a...
a younger sister, Caroline, and she's the closest to me in age and we get along all the time.
She's awesome.
Then I have a youngest sibling.
He's my brother, Andrew...
Whatever.
He's a dick.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's just, like, moody, and when we were growing up, he would, like, smoke pot, and break curfew and... get away with it, which drove me insane.
Andrew's my hero.
I...
I love Andrew.
It's just typical sibling rivalry bullshit.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No.
I got this.
- You don't have to do that.
- No, no, no.
I'm happy to, really.
I'm gonna be honest, I was kinda doing the slow motion move for my wallet.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- [laughs]
You were moving pretty slow there.
It was like you were buffering.
- [laughs] I got you next time.
- [chuckling]
Okay.
Yeah.
So, um... [clicks tongue] what are you doin' now?
You wanna keep hangin' out?
You sick of me?
Or...
- I'm not getting sick of you.
- Well, I'm not sick of you.
You wanna... go to a movie or something?
There's a theater down the street.
Yeah.
- So, what's your go-to snack?
- Hmm.
Good question.
Maybe a...
Kit Kat.
Oh, my God.
Okay, pretend you're talking.
Okay, uh... blah, blah, blah.
We're pretending, we're pretending.
Who are we trying to avoid?
Oh, God.
My ex.
He's over there.
- I cannot deal with him.
- Wait, the guy in the white shirt?
Don't look at him.
Stop.
Hey, buddy, want a little popcorn with that butter?
Geez Louise.
He's putting on a lot of butter.
You can't see.
Okay, he is going...
He is gone.
- Oh, thank God.
- So, uh...
How did you meet, uh...
What's his name?
- Dustin.
- Dustin.
He used to manage my friend's band.
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.
Turns out, it's only cool-adjacent, which suits him perfectly.
Mmm.
[sighs]
Were you crying during the movie?
- No.
- Yes, you were.
- Mmm...
What?
- [laughing]
Come on, gimme a break.
Father-son stuff always really gets to me.
So...
But he was a terrible father.
He didn't start caring about his son until he followed in his footsteps and became a bounty hunter.
No, he wanted to be a good father, he just couldn't be.
- That's, like, why I was so sad.
- Mmm.
You know what makes me cry during movies?
When a character faces death with dignity.
That's some real Terms of Endearment shit.
- Oh, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, it's okay that you cried.
- Thank you.
It could also be the shrooms.
'Cause sometimes people are emotional the day after they take them.
I appreciate how much you're trying to help me, but I would've cried regardless.
[chuckles]
Okay. [chuckles]
Um, I'm gonna pee.
- Do you mind holding this for me?
- Sure.
- I don't wanna pee all over it.
- No.
- All right.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Mickey.
Oh.
Jesus.
Hi.
- Oh, sorry.
Did I scare you?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've actually been wanting to apologize for what I said at Shaun's party.
Okay.
They were tenting my place for termites.
It was a nightmare.
And then I saw you that night and you were an easy target...
Anyway, I'm...
I'm sorry I called you a, uh...
- Whore?
- Whore.
Yes.
I'm very sorry. [clears throat] That's not who I am.
I mean, it's who I was in that moment... but I shouldn't have said that.
Thank you.
I...
I appreciate that.
[smacks lips] So... here alone?
Uh, yeah, you?
No.
With a guy.
Oh.
A boyfriend?
No, just a guy I see movies with.
Mmm, mysterious.
How's the dog?
- You mean our dog?
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
It's your dog.
I clearly remember giving up parental rights.
[laughs] Um, he is good.
I just took him downtown for the blessing of the animals.
- You wanna see a picture?
- Yeah, of course.
- [Mickey] Oh, my God.
Look at Buster.
- [chuckles]
He is so cute and so old.
- Yeah, look at this.
- [sighs] [softly] Oh, my God.
His whole snout's gray now.
- [chuckles]
- Has it really been that long?
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
Um... [smacks lips]
- Dustin, this is Gus.
- Hello.
- Hey.
- Gus, this is Dustin.
- And that is his dog Buster.
- Yeah.
Ah, look at that cutie. [chuckles]
He takes after you.
He's got your eyes.
- [laughs] Yeah.
- [Gus chuckles]
What are you kids doing today?
I don't know.
I guess, we're just kinda playing it by ear.
- Making it up as we go along.
Yeah.
- Nothing wrong with that.
How's your Sunday going?
Uh, it's fine.
I actually...
I gotta run, 'cause I do have plans.
- Okay, cool.
- Nice to see you.
- Have a nice day, kids.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you too.
Nice to meet ya.
Hey, I know I'm not supposed to like him, but I kinda do.
Well, he was a huge asshole to me the last time I saw him, but...
Oh, should I have been meaner to him?
Do you want me to online bully him or anything, or... [laughing]
No, no, he... actually, just apologized to me, weirdly.
- I was...
- Oh?
- kind of impressed.
- About what?
He was, uh, freaking out at me and accusing me of cheating on him, which I kind of did.
Okay.
But we were basically broken up.
And he was always out of town, and I would never do anything like that anymore because that's not who I am now, with SLAA, and you're nothing like...
Whatever.
You know what?
I'm...
I'm happy that I did it.
Because if I was with Dustin now, then I wouldn't be here with you.
That's sweet.
Here we go.
[car lock beeps] [sighs] All right.
[scoffs] Okay, I gotta ask.
Why do you always have a beach towel in your backseat?
Uh...
I don't know.
It's kind of a aspirational thing, like...
I hope that one day I can go to the beach and use that towel.
So you've never actually used it?
No.
I mean, I've... put it on wet grass at the park, but it's never touched sand.
- Let's go right now.
- To the beach?
Yeah.
Why not?
Okay.
Let's give this towel the best day of its life.
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's road trip.

[Gus] Yeah.
[Mickey] It's the best day I've had in a long time.
Yeah, me too.
It's funny though, when something like this is, like, going really well...
I get, like, super nervous, like,
"Oh, when is something bad gonna happen and it's all gonna end?"
- Ya know?
- Yeah.
Me too.
[sighs]
What's the worst thing you've ever done?
[sighs heavily] Seriously?
We're gonna find it out eventually, may as well get it over with.
All right, that makes sense.
Yeah.
You go first.
Um, let me think.
Okay, uh...
If you can't think of it right away, you've never done anything that bad.
No, I'm just stalling, trying to come up with a way not to tell you this.
You can't.
Okay.
Um... [exhales sharply]
When I was in college,
I went to this party and I got, like, super wasted, and then everybody started daring me to...
- take a shit in my hand.
- Mmm-hmm.
And, um...
I did.
- I...
I took a shit in my hand.
- Okay.
And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
"Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."
Yeah, I can't play this game with you.
You're an amateur.
You can't do that.
That's cheating.
Just tell me your fifth-worst thing.
[Gus] Okay.
All right.
Let's go.
- No, thank you, sir.
- What?
- You have to.
- No!
Are you kidding me?
It's super polluted, and it's really cold.
My mom sent me this whole article about how all the city's run-off ends up in the ocean.
It's a health hazard.
We came all this way to be at the beach.
You don't just climb up to the tower and not ring that bell.
Let's get in there.
Let's get in the water.
This is being at the beach.
I'm on the towel.
I'm good.
No, being at the beach is getting into the ocean.
What if we go in there, we get a disease and die?
Come on, there's billions and trillions of gallons of water in there.
If you get E. coli...
I'll buy you ice cream.
I'm not dressed for it!
This isn't a beach outfit!
Okay.
Tell the towel.
You tell the towel that we came all this way just to sit in sand and not go into the water.
- Come on.
- All right.
- But I'm only putting my toe in.
- Toes, that's fine.
- Toes only.
- At least you're getting wet.
Awesome!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
You should never make a woman do things she doesn't wanna do.
[laughing] Don't make me sound awful.

Okay, come on.

It happened!
It fucking happened.
We didn't think it would.

Sorry.
It's okay.

Did you, uh, make some new friends?
Yes, Mom.
All right.
I just wanna know about you and your new friends.
If they're coming over, let me know, and I'll pick up some sodas beforehand.
Do you, uh... wanna get some food?
Yeah.
A little brunch action?
Yeah.
We can do that.
Sure.
What?
I just saw you do your mirror face.
- My mirror face?
What is it?
- It was like this.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I look sexy in the mirror.
I gotta know how I look.
Oh, just you wait.
There's gonna come a day when I catch you doin' your mirror face.
I am gonna relish that shit.
Oh, my God.
- You see that building right there?
- Uh-huh.
That's where my first job in LA was.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
I was an assistant to this publicist who repped the entire cast of The Hills.
Oh, that's cool.
Mmm, no.
Too much drama.
Isn't that the point of the show?
Drama?
Not in real life.
Not when Justin Bobby shows up at your house in the middle of the night crying 'cause he's the only one who wasn't included in the spread in Teen Vogue.
Oh, Justin Bobby.
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
No.
- That makes me like you so much more.
- Good.
Do you ever think,
"What would I do if there was an earthquake right now?"
Oh, yeah, all the time.
I guarantee you and me will experience, like, a huge earthquake at some point in our lives.
- Really?
The big one?
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Because think about it.
We haven't had, like, a true crisis in Los Angeles in years.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
- In the '90s, there were the riots, the Northridge earthquakes, OJ.
So we're due up for disaster.
Well, if there is an apocalyptic event, I will not be helpful.
I will almost certainly make things worse.
Mmm.
Stick with me, then, 'cause I have a good plan if there's a disaster.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
- Immediately kill myself.
- Mmm.
Smart.
How you gonna do it?
Hmm, jump off the roof of The Grove parking lot.
So you didn't grow up with, like, a dream of becoming a teacher?
No.
No.
I didn't really wanna be a teacher.
I was always, like, obsessed with, like,
TV shows and movies and stuff.
I even memorized which studios made which movies.
Oh, my God, why?
To impress girls, obviously.
Forrest Gump.
Okay, uh, Paramount.
- Mmm.
Se7en.
- New Line.
- Um, Fast and the Furious.
- Universal.
- First Wives Club.
- Paramount.
- Silence of the Lambs.
- Orion.
La Dolce Vita.
Did you say, "Cocktail"?
Is that what I heard?
"Cocktail"?
Touchstone.
- Still impressive.
- Thank you.
Plus, I feel like I just got a window into the life of 14-year-old Gus.
Yikes!
Gus Cru-shek?
- Oh, right here.
- Hey.
- Are you not gonna correct her?
- That's close enough.
I don't wanna go to swim class.
You have to go.
We already paid for it.
Cost 300 bucks for that whole package.
That's $50 for each one.
- Why don't you want to go...
- Makes sense.
That is such a classic, passive-aggressive dad move.
That reminds me of my dad when we'd go out in public and he'd yell at us.
- You know, just restrained and angry.
- Really?
Yeah.
I mean, usually it was about how, like... we shouldn't get dessert at the restaurant because we have plenty of ice cream at home, sort of thing.
- Yeah.
- But still, very mad.
We always ordered dessert, no question.
Oh, really?
You guys were a real, uh, Richie Rich family, huh?
We were kind of rich when my dad was still employed.
Hmm.
Yeah, we were strictly middle class, baby!
But if we had lived in a big city, you know, like, LA or New York, we would've been totally dirt poor.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Especially with four kids, so...
- Did you have siblings?
- Just one.
My brother Bob.
- Bobby Dobby.
- Bobby Dobb.
And, uh, what's, uh...
What's Bobby Dobby do now?
Lives in Tucson.
He's got two kids, Lilian and...
Fuck, I can never remember the boy's name.
Your nephew?
- You don't remember your nephew's name?
- Oh, okay.
In my defense, he's, like, three years old, so he hasn't made that big of an impression on me.
And the last time I saw him, he told me that my head looked like a butt.
What about you?
Older or younger, your siblings?
Oh, both.
I have an older brother, uh, Ken, who's the perfect kid.
- Wait.
You're not the perfect child?
- No.
- What?
- Uh, yeah, he, like...
He still lives in my hometown, Brookings, with his family, so my parents love him.
I mean, that makes sense.
And then, I have a...
a younger sister, Caroline, and she's the closest to me in age and we get along all the time.
She's awesome.
Then I have a youngest sibling.
He's my brother, Andrew...
Whatever.
He's a dick.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's just, like, moody, and when we were growing up, he would, like, smoke pot, and break curfew and... get away with it, which drove me insane.
Andrew's my hero.
I...
I love Andrew.
It's just typical sibling rivalry bullshit.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No.
I got this.
- You don't have to do that.
- No, no, no.
I'm happy to, really.
I'm gonna be honest, I was kinda doing the slow motion move for my wallet.
Yeah, I noticed.
You were moving pretty slow there.
It was like you were buffering.
I got you next time.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, um... what are you doin' now?
You wanna keep hangin' out?
You sick of me?
Or...
- I'm not getting sick of you.
- Well, I'm not sick of you.
You wanna... go to a movie or something?
There's a theater down the street.
Yeah.
- So, what's your go-to snack?
- Hmm.
Good question.
Maybe a...
Kit Kat.
Oh, my God.
Okay, pretend you're talking.
Okay, uh... blah, blah, blah.
We're pretending, we're pretending.
Who are we trying to avoid?
Oh, God.
My ex.
He's over there.
- I cannot deal with him.
- Wait, the guy in the white shirt?
Don't look at him.
Stop.
Hey, buddy, want a little popcorn with that butter?
Geez Louise.
He's putting on a lot of butter.
You can't see.
Okay, he is going...
He is gone.
- Oh, thank God.
- So, uh...
How did you meet, uh...
What's his name?
- Dustin.
- Dustin.
He used to manage my friend's band.
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.
Turns out, it's only cool-adjacent, which suits him perfectly.
Mmm.
Were you crying during the movie?
- No.
- Yes, you were.
Mmm...
What?
Come on, gimme a break.
Father-son stuff always really gets to me.
So...
But he was a terrible father.
He didn't start caring about his son until he followed in his footsteps and became a bounty hunter.
No, he wanted to be a good father, he just couldn't be.
- That's, like, why I was so sad.
- Mmm.
You know what makes me cry during movies?
When a character faces death with dignity.
That's some real Terms of Endearment shit.
- Oh, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, it's okay that you cried.
- Thank you.
It could also be the shrooms.
'Cause sometimes people are emotional the day after they take them.
I appreciate how much you're trying to help me, but I would've cried regardless.
Okay.
Um, I'm gonna pee.
- Do you mind holding this for me?
- Sure.
- I don't wanna pee all over it.
- No.
- All right.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Mickey.
Oh.
Jesus.
Hi.
- Oh, sorry.
Did I scare you?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've actually been wanting to apologize for what I said at Shaun's party.
Okay.
They were tenting my place for termites.
It was a nightmare.
And then I saw you that night and you were an easy target...
Anyway, I'm...
I'm sorry I called you a, uh...
- Whore?
- Whore.
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
That's not who I am.
I mean, it's who I was in that moment... but I shouldn't have said that.
Thank you.
I...
I appreciate that.
So... here alone?
Uh, yeah, you?
No.
With a guy.
Oh.
A boyfriend?
No, just a guy I see movies with.
Mmm, mysterious.
How's the dog?
- You mean our dog?
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
It's your dog.
I clearly remember giving up parental rights.
Um, he is good.
I just took him downtown for the blessing of the animals.
- You wanna see a picture?
- Yeah, of course.
Oh, my God.
Look at Buster.
He is so cute and so old.
Yeah, look at this.
Oh, my God.
His whole snout's gray now.
Has it really been that long?
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
Um...
- Dustin, this is Gus.
- Hello.
- Hey.
- Gus, this is Dustin.
- And that is his dog Buster.
- Yeah.
Ah, look at that cutie.
He takes after you.
He's got your eyes.
Yeah.
What are you kids doing today?
I don't know.
I guess, we're just kinda playing it by ear.
- Making it up as we go along.
Yeah.
- Nothing wrong with that.
How's your Sunday going?
Uh, it's fine.
I actually...
I gotta run, 'cause I do have plans.
- Okay, cool.
- Nice to see you.
- Have a nice day, kids.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you too.
Nice to meet ya.
Hey, I know I'm not supposed to like him, but I kinda do.
Well, he was a huge asshole to me the last time I saw him, but...
Oh, should I have been meaner to him?
Do you want me to online bully him or anything, or...
No, no, he... actually, just apologized to me, weirdly.
- I was...
- Oh?
- kind of impressed.
- About what?
He was, uh, freaking out at me and accusing me of cheating on him, which I kind of did.
Okay.
But we were basically broken up.
And he was always out of town, and I would never do anything like that anymore because that's not who I am now, with SLAA, and you're nothing like...
Whatever.
You know what?
I'm...
I'm happy that I did it.
Because if I was with Dustin now, then I wouldn't be here with you.
That's sweet.
Here we go.
All right.
Okay, I gotta ask.
Why do you always have a beach towel in your backseat?
Uh...
I don't know.
It's kind of a aspirational thing, like...
I hope that one day I can go to the beach and use that towel.
So you've never actually used it?
No.
I mean, I've... put it on wet grass at the park, but it's never touched sand.
- Let's go right now.
- To the beach?
Yeah.
Why not?
Okay.
Let's give this towel the best day of its life.
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's road trip.
Okay.
I gotta admit.
This is pretty nice.
Yeah.
It's the best day I've had in a long time.
Yeah, me too.
It's funny though, when something like this is, like, going really well...
I get, like, super nervous, like,
"Oh, when is something bad gonna happen and it's all gonna end?"
- Ya know?
- Yeah.
Me too.
What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Seriously?
We're gonna find it out eventually, may as well get it over with.
All right, that makes sense.
Yeah.
You go first.
Um, let me think.
Okay, uh...
If you can't think of it right away, you've never done anything that bad.
No, I'm just stalling, trying to come up with a way not to tell you this.
You can't.
Okay.
Um...
When I was in college,
I went to this party and I got, like, super wasted, and then everybody started daring me to...
- take a shit in my hand.
- Mmm-hmm.
And, um...
I did.
- I...
I took a shit in my hand.
- Okay.
And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
"Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."
Yeah, I can't play this game with you.
You're an amateur.
You can't do that.
That's cheating.
Just tell me your fifth-worst thing.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go.
- No, thank you, sir.
- What?
- You have to.
- No!
Are you kidding me?
It's super polluted, and it's really cold.
My mom sent me this whole article about how all the city's run-off ends up in the ocean.
It's a health hazard.
We came all this way to be at the beach.
You don't just climb up to the tower and not ring that bell.
Let's get in there.
Let's get in the water.
This is being at the beach.
I'm on the towel.
I'm good.
No, being at the beach is getting into the ocean.
What if we go in there, we get a disease and die?
Come on, there's billions and trillions of gallons of water in there.
If you get E. coli...
I'll buy you ice cream.
I'm not dressed for it!
This isn't a beach outfit!
Okay.
Tell the towel.
You tell the towel that we came all this way just to sit in sand and not go into the water.
- Come on.
- All right.
- But I'm only putting my toe in.
- Toes, that's fine.
- Toes only.
- At least you're getting wet.
Awesome!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
You should never make a woman do things she doesn't wanna do.
Don't make me sound awful.
Like I'm a terrible human being.
Okay, come on.
Right.
That's good.
- All right.
No!
- All right.
Okay.
That's good.
Okay.
All right.
Wait for it.
- All right.
- Here it is.
God, here it comes.
- Oh, no.
- Here we go.
Yeah!
It happened!
It fucking happened.
We didn't think it would.
Okay...
All right, then.
- Bye.
- Bye.
So, uh...
What you up to this week?
So, like, I wanna text you... but I don't wanna pester you or annoy you.
We don't have to do this.
What?
I'm sorry.
I just...
I meant that...
I'm not gonna disappear on you, Gus.
Text me whenever.
I always wanna hear from you.
You're not going to annoy me.
You're not gonna annoy me either.
So...
I like you.
I like you too.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Do you wanna go get a condom?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Hey, can I get your Wi-Fi password?
Oh!
Getting a little ahead of yourself.
Aren't you, mister?
Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?
Yeah, I watched half that Edward Snowden documentary.
- And now I'm very careful.
- Seriously?
- No, it's just easier if I type it in.
- Oh, right.
Hey, I liked waking up next to you this morning.
You're a peaceful sleeper.
I like it.
Oh, yeah, I go into, like, a super deep trance zone.
- Yeah.
- You are not a peaceful sleeper.
- Oh, no?
- You were very chatty.
Fuck.
I've heard that before.
What did I say?
You were like, "I'm sorry, Brenda Blethyn."
And then you started laughing.
I laughed?
Well, that's super creepy.
Mmm, it was.
But I liked it.
This is nice.
Yeah.
Wish we could just stay in bed all day.
Why don't we, huh?
You got any plans?
I really want to, I do.
But I gotta go to SLAA.
SLAA.
S-L-A-A, that's what they call it.
Ah!
SLAA.
- I get it.
That makes sense.
- Yep.
What time is it?
Now-ish?
Sorry.
It's okay.
It's good that you're going.
Seriously.
You should go.
Go, go, go.
Do you want, like... a fresh T-shirt or something?
No, I'm good.
Thanks.
You sure?
You ran, like, three miles last night.
Yeah?
Ugh!
I'm a little ripe.
- Here, this one should fit.
- Okay.
- I'm not tripping still, am I?
- You tell me.
I'm not.
- Oh, that looks cute on you.
- Thank you.
Hey, you know, you could come with me if you want to.
Really?
Is that cool?
- Yeah.
- Like, go into the meeting, or...
No.
Wait for me outside.
Yeah!
Sure, if that's cool.
As long as you won't get bored.
No.
I'll just... hang out in my car, watch videos of kids coming out from under anesthesia.
Have you ever seen those?
Uh, really, it's funny, seeing fucked-up kids.
Ugh.
I hate all my clothes.
Mom, how's it goin'?
Is Dad around?
An estate sale?
That's cool.
This is embarrassing, but I don't remember your name.
Jorie.
J-O-R-I-E.
- Short for Marjorie.
Just call whenever.
- Amazing.
Thank you, I will.
Okay... this may be against the rules or whatever, but...
Yeah?
What's up?
I hung out with this guy last night... and now I really wanna spend the day with him.
Is that not cool?
Should I not do that?
All right, well, were you honest with him about SLAA?
- Yeah.
- And he's cool with it?
Yeah.
I mean, don't look now, but he's waiting for me in the car.
He's almost too cool with it.
Yeah.
Just hang out with him.
Really?
'Cause I don't wanna binge on him.
I...
I wanna do this right for once.
The program is about learning to be in a healthy relationship.
And just because you are new doesn't mean you have to walk away from something good because of bad timing.
Fuck timing.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I gotta go to spin class.
The road to self-improvement is never ending.
- Bye, Jorie.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How's it going?
How was the meeting?
Or, uh, can I not...
I don't know what I'm allowed to ask.
- It was good.
- Good.
- Thank you for asking.
- Good.
Of course.
Cool.
Did you, uh, make some new friends?
Yes, Mom.
All right.
I just wanna know about you and your new friends.
If they're coming over, let me know, and I'll pick up some sodas beforehand.
Do you, uh... wanna get some food?
Yeah.
A little brunch action?
Yeah.
We can do that.
Sure.
What?
I just saw you do your mirror face.
- My mirror face?
What is it?
- It was like this.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I look sexy in the mirror.
I gotta know how I look.
Oh, just you wait.
There's gonna come a day when I catch you doin' your mirror face.

- I don't wanna pee all over it.
- No.
- All right.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Mickey.
Oh.
Jesus.
Hi.
- Oh, sorry.
Did I scare you?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've actually been wanting to apologize for what I said at Shaun's party.
Okay.
They were tenting my place for termites.
It was a nightmare.
And then I saw you that night and you were an easy target...
Anyway, I'm...
I'm sorry I called you a, uh...
- Whore?
- Whore.
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
That's not who I am.
I mean, it's who I was in that moment... but I shouldn't have said that.
Thank you.
I...
I appreciate that.
So... here alone?
Uh, yeah, you?
No.
With a guy.
Oh.
A boyfriend?
No, just a guy I see movies with.
Mmm, mysterious.
How's the dog?
- You mean our dog?
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
It's your dog.
I clearly remember giving up parental rights.
Um, he is good.
I just took him downtown for the blessing of the animals.
- You wanna see a picture?
- Yeah, of course.
Oh, my God.
Look at Buster.
He is so cute and so old.
Yeah, look at this.
Oh, my God.
His whole snout's gray now.
Has it really been that long?
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
Um...
- Dustin, this is Gus.
- Hello.
- Hey.
- Gus, this is Dustin.
- And that is his dog Buster.
- Yeah.
Ah, look at that cutie.
He takes after you.
He's got your eyes.
Yeah.
What are you kids doing today?
I don't know.
I guess, we're just kinda playing it by ear.
- Making it up as we go along.
Yeah.
- Nothing wrong with that.
How's your Sunday going?
Uh, it's fine.
I actually...
I gotta run, 'cause I do have plans.
- Okay, cool.
- Nice to see you.
- Have a nice day, kids.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you too.
Nice to meet ya.
Hey, I know I'm not supposed to like him, but I kinda do.
Well, he was a huge asshole to me the last time I saw him, but...
Oh, should I have been meaner to him?
Do you want me to online bully him or anything, or...
No, no, he... actually, just apologized to me, weirdly.
- I was...
- Oh?
- kind of impressed.
- About what?
He was, uh, freaking out at me and accusing me of cheating on him, which I kind of did.
Okay.
But we were basically broken up.
And he was always out of town, and I would never do anything like that anymore because that's not who I am now, with SLAA, and you're nothing like...
Whatever.
You know what?
I'm...
I'm happy that I did it.
Because if I was with Dustin now, then I wouldn't be here with you.
That's sweet.
Here we go.
All right.
Okay, I gotta ask.
Why do you always have a beach towel in your backseat?
Uh...
I don't know.
It's kind of a aspirational thing, like...
I hope that one day I can go to the beach and use that towel.
So you've never actually used it?
No.
I mean, I've... put it on wet grass at the park, but it's never touched sand.
- Let's go right now.
- To the beach?
Yeah.
Why not?
Okay.
Let's give this towel the best day of its life.
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's road trip.
Okay.
I gotta admit.
This is pretty nice.
Yeah.
It's the best day I've had in a long time.
Yeah, me too.
It's funny though, when something like this is, like, going really well...
I get, like, super nervous, like,
"Oh, when is something bad gonna happen and it's all gonna end?"
- Ya know?
- Yeah.
Me too.
What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Seriously?
We're gonna find it out eventually, may as well get it over with.
All right, that makes sense.
Yeah.
You go first.
Um, let me think.
Okay, uh...
If you can't think of it right away, you've never done anything that bad.
No, I'm just stalling, trying to come up with a way not to tell you this.
You can't.
Okay.
Um...
When I was in college,
I went to this party and I got, like, super wasted, and then everybody started daring me to...
- take a shit in my hand.
- Mmm-hmm.
And, um...
I did.
- I...
I took a shit in my hand.
- Okay.
And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
"Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."
Yeah, I can't play this game with you.
You're an amateur.
You can't do that.
That's cheating.
Just tell me your fifth-worst thing.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go.
- No, thank you, sir.
- What?
- You have to.
- No!
Are you kidding me?
It's super polluted, and it's really cold.
My mom sent me this whole article about how all the city's run-off ends up in the ocean.
It's a health hazard.
We came all this way to be at the beach.
You don't just climb up to the tower and not ring that bell.
Let's get in there.
Let's get in the water.
This is being at the beach.
I'm on the towel.
I'm good.
No, being at the beach is getting into the ocean.
What if we go in there, we get a disease and die?
Come on, there's billions and trillions of gallons of water in there.
If you get E. coli...
I'll buy you ice cream.
I'm not dressed for it!
This isn't a beach outfit!
Okay.
Tell the towel.
You tell the towel that we came all this way just to sit in sand and not go into the water.
- Come on.
- All right.
- But I'm only putting my toe in.
- Toes, that's fine.
- Toes only.
- At least you're getting wet.
Awesome!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
You should never make a woman do things she doesn't wanna do.
Don't make me sound awful.
Like I'm a terrible human being.
Okay, come on.
Right.
That's good.
- All right.
No!
- All right.
Okay.
That's good.
Okay.
All right.
Wait for it.
- All right.
- Here it is.
God, here it comes.
- Oh, no.
- Here we go.
Yeah!
It happened!
It fucking happened.
We didn't think it would.
Okay...
All right, then.
- Bye.
- Bye.
So, uh...
What you up to this week?
So, like, I wanna text you... but I don't wanna pester you or annoy you.
We don't have to do this.
What?
I'm sorry.
I just...
I meant that...
I'm not gonna disappear on you, Gus.
Text me whenever.
I always wanna hear from you.
You're not going to annoy me.
You're not gonna annoy me either.
So...
I like you.
I like you too.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.

[theme music playing]
[Gus inhales deeply]
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Okay.
[Gus grunts] [both breathing heavily]
- Do you wanna go get a condom?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
[both chuckle]
- [whirring] - [both chuckle]
[Mickey moaning]
Hey, can I get your Wi-Fi password?
Oh!
Getting a little ahead of yourself.
Aren't you, mister?
Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?
Yeah, I watched half that Edward Snowden documentary.
- And now I'm very careful.
- [chuckles] Seriously?
- No, it's just easier if I type it in.
- Oh, right. [sniffles]
Hey, I liked waking up next to you this morning.
You're a peaceful sleeper.
I like it.
Oh, yeah, I go into, like, a super deep trance zone.
- Yeah.
- You are not a peaceful sleeper.
- Oh, no?
- You were very chatty.
[groans] Fuck.
I've heard that before.
What did I say?
You were like, "I'm sorry, Brenda Blethyn."
- And then you started laughing.
- [laughs]
I laughed?
Well, that's super creepy.
Mmm, it was.
But I liked it.
This is nice.
Yeah.
Wish we could just stay in bed all day.
- Why don't we, huh?
You got any plans?
- [sighs] [smacks lips] I really want to, I do.
But I gotta go to SLAA.
SLAA.
S-L-A-A, that's what they call it.
Ah!
SLAA.
- I get it.
That makes sense.
- Yep.
What time is it?
[inhales] Now-ish?
Sorry.
- It's okay.
- [inhales deeply]
It's good that you're going.
Seriously.
You should go.
Go, go, go.
Do you want, like... a fresh T-shirt or something?
[grunts] No, I'm good.
Thanks.
You sure?
You ran, like, three miles last night.
Yeah?
[sniffs] Ugh!
I'm a little ripe.
- Here, this one should fit.
- Okay.
[sighs]
- I'm not tripping still, am I?
- You tell me.
[chuckles] I'm not.
- Oh, that looks cute on you.
- Thank you.
Hey, you know, you could come with me if you want to.
Really?
Is that cool?
- Yeah.
- Like, go into the meeting, or...
No.
Wait for me outside.
Yeah!
Sure, if that's cool.
As long as you won't get bored.
No.
I'll just... hang out in my car, watch videos of kids coming out from under anesthesia.
Have you ever seen those?
Uh, really, it's funny, seeing fucked-up kids.
- [snorts] - [Gus chuckles]
Ugh.
I hate all my clothes. [scoffs]
[sighs]
Mom, how's it goin'?
Is Dad around?
An estate sale?
That's cool.
This is embarrassing, but I don't remember your name.
[scoffs]
Jorie.
J-O-R-I-E.
- Short for Marjorie.
Just call whenever.
- Amazing.
Thank you, I will.
Okay... this may be against the rules or whatever, but...
Yeah?
What's up?
I hung out with this guy last night... and now I really wanna spend the day with him.
Is that not cool?
Should I not do that?
All right, well, were you honest with him about SLAA?
- Yeah.
- And he's cool with it?
Yeah.
I mean, don't look now, but he's waiting for me in the car.
He's almost too cool with it.
Yeah.
Just hang out with him.
Really?
'Cause I don't wanna binge on him.
I...
I wanna do this right for once.
The program is about learning to be in a healthy relationship.
And just because you are new doesn't mean you have to walk away from something good because of bad timing.
Fuck timing.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I gotta go to spin class.
The road to self-improvement is never ending.
- Bye, Jorie.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How's it going?
How was the meeting?
Or, uh, can I not...
I don't know what I'm allowed to ask.
- It was good.
- Good.
- Thank you for asking.
- Good.
Of course.
Cool.
Did you, uh, make some new friends?
- Yes, Mom.
- [both chuckle]
All right. [chuckles]
I just wanna know about you and your new friends.
If they're coming over, let me know, and I'll pick up some sodas beforehand.
Do you, uh... wanna get some food?
Yeah.
A little brunch action?
Yeah.
We can do that.
Sure.
[sniggers]
What?
I just saw you do your mirror face.
- My mirror face?
What is it?
- It was like this.
[chuckling] Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I look sexy in the mirror.
- [laughing]
- I gotta know how I look.
Oh, just you wait.
There's gonna come a day when I catch you doin' your mirror face.
I am gonna relish that shit.
[Mickey] Oh, my God.
- You see that building right there?
- Uh-huh.
That's where my first job in LA was.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
I was an assistant to this publicist who repped the entire cast of The Hills.
Oh, that's cool.
Mmm, no.
Too much drama.
Isn't that the point of the show?
Drama?
Not in real life.
Not when Justin Bobby shows up at your house in the middle of the night crying 'cause he's the only one who wasn't included in the spread in Teen Vogue.
[chuckles]
Oh, Justin Bobby.
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
No.
- That makes me like you so much more.
- [chuckles softly] Good.
[Mickey] Do you ever think,
"What would I do if there was an earthquake right now?"
[Gus] Oh, yeah, all the time.
I guarantee you and me will experience, like, a huge earthquake at some point in our lives.
- Really?
The big one?
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Because think about it.
We haven't had, like, a true crisis in Los Angeles in years.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
- In the '90s, there were the riots, the Northridge earthquakes, OJ.
- So we're due up for disaster.
- [inhales sharply]
Well, if there is an apocalyptic event, I will not be helpful.
I will almost certainly make things worse.
Mmm.
Stick with me, then, 'cause I have a good plan if there's a disaster.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
- Immediately kill myself.
- [Mickey] Mmm.
Smart.
How you gonna do it?
[Gus] Hmm, jump off the roof of The Grove parking lot.
So you didn't grow up with, like, a dream of becoming a teacher?
No.
No.
I didn't really wanna be a teacher.
I was always, like, obsessed with, like,
TV shows and movies and stuff.
I even memorized which studios made which movies.
Oh, my God, why?
To impress girls, obviously.
Forrest Gump.
[gasps] Okay, uh, Paramount.
- Mmm.
Se7en.
- New Line.
- Um, Fast and the Furious.
- Universal.
- First Wives Club.
- Paramount.
- Silence of the Lambs.
- Orion.
- La Dolce Vita.
- [inhales sharply]
Did you say, "Cocktail"?
Is that what I heard?
"Cocktail"?
Touchstone.
- Still impressive.
- Thank you.
Plus, I feel like I just got a window into the life of 14-year-old Gus.
Yikes!
Gus Cru-shek?
- Oh, right here.
- Hey.
- Are you not gonna correct her?
- That's close enough.
[boy] I don't wanna go to swim class.
[man] You have to go.
We already paid for it.
Cost 300 bucks for that whole package.
That's $50 for each one.
- [woman] Why don't you want to go...
- Makes sense.
That is such a classic, passive-aggressive dad move.
That reminds me of my dad when we'd go out in public and he'd yell at us.
- You know, just restrained and angry.
- Really?
Yeah.
I mean, usually it was about how, like... [inhales deeply] we shouldn't get dessert at the restaurant because we have plenty of ice cream at home, sort of thing.
- Yeah.
- But still, very mad.
We always ordered dessert, no question.
Oh, really?
You guys were a real, uh, Richie Rich family, huh?
We were kind of rich when my dad was still employed.
Hmm.
Yeah, we were strictly middle class, baby!
[both chuckle]
But if we had lived in a big city, you know, like, LA or New York, we would've been totally dirt poor.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Especially with four kids, so...
- Did you have siblings?
- Just one.
My brother Bob.
- Bobby Dobby.
- Bobby Dobb.
And, uh, what's, uh... [sighs] What's Bobby Dobby do now?
Lives in Tucson.
He's got two kids, Lilian and...
Fuck, I can never remember the boy's name.
- Your nephew?
- [gasps]
- You don't remember your nephew's name?
- Oh, okay.
In my defense, he's, like, three years old, so he hasn't made that big of an impression on me.
And the last time I saw him, he told me that my head looked like a butt.
[both chuckle softly]
What about you?
Older or younger, your siblings?
Oh, both. [inhales sharply]
I have an older brother, uh, Ken, who's the perfect kid.
- Wait.
You're not the perfect child?
- No.
- What?
- Uh, yeah, he, like...
He still lives in my hometown, Brookings, with his family, so my parents love him.
I mean, that makes sense.
And then, I have a...
a younger sister, Caroline, and she's the closest to me in age and we get along all the time.
She's awesome.
Then I have a youngest sibling.
He's my brother, Andrew...
Whatever.
He's a dick.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's just, like, moody, and when we were growing up, he would, like, smoke pot, and break curfew and... get away with it, which drove me insane.
Andrew's my hero.
I...
I love Andrew.
It's just typical sibling rivalry bullshit.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No.
I got this.
- You don't have to do that.
- No, no, no.
I'm happy to, really.
I'm gonna be honest, I was kinda doing the slow motion move for my wallet.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- [laughs]
You were moving pretty slow there.
It was like you were buffering.
- [laughs] I got you next time.
- [chuckling]
Okay.
Yeah.
So, um... [clicks tongue] what are you doin' now?
You wanna keep hangin' out?
You sick of me?
Or...
- I'm not getting sick of you.
- Well, I'm not sick of you.
You wanna... go to a movie or something?
There's a theater down the street.
Yeah.
- So, what's your go-to snack?
- Hmm.
Good question.
Maybe a...
Kit Kat.
Oh, my God.
Okay, pretend you're talking.
Okay, uh... blah, blah, blah.
We're pretending, we're pretending.
Who are we trying to avoid?
Oh, God.
My ex.
He's over there.
- I cannot deal with him.
- Wait, the guy in the white shirt?
Don't look at him.
Stop.
Hey, buddy, want a little popcorn with that butter?
Geez Louise.
He's putting on a lot of butter.
You can't see.
Okay, he is going...
He is gone.
- Oh, thank God.
- So, uh...
How did you meet, uh...
What's his name?
- Dustin.
- Dustin.
He used to manage my friend's band.
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.
Turns out, it's only cool-adjacent, which suits him perfectly.
Mmm.
[sighs]
Were you crying during the movie?
- No.
- Yes, you were.
- Mmm...
What?
- [laughing]
Come on, gimme a break.
Father-son stuff always really gets to me.
So...
But he was a terrible father.
He didn't start caring about his son until he followed in his footsteps and became a bounty hunter.
No, he wanted to be a good father, he just couldn't be.
- That's, like, why I was so sad.
- Mmm.
You know what makes me cry during movies?
When a character faces death with dignity.
That's some real Terms of Endearment shit.
- Oh, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, it's okay that you cried.
- Thank you.
It could also be the shrooms.
'Cause sometimes people are emotional the day after they take them.
I appreciate how much you're trying to help me, but I would've cried regardless.
[chuckles]
Okay. [chuckles]
Um, I'm gonna pee.
- Do you mind holding this for me?
- Sure.
- I don't wanna pee all over it.
- No.
- All right.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Mickey.
Oh.
Jesus.
Hi.
- Oh, sorry.
Did I scare you?
- Uh, yeah.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've actually been wanting to apologize for what I said at Shaun's party.

Yes.
I'm very sorry. [clears throat] That's not who I am.
I mean, it's who I was in that moment... but I shouldn't have said that.
Thank you.
I...
I appreciate that.
[smacks lips] So... here alone?
Uh, yeah, you?
No.

Oh.

No, just a guy I see movies with.

He is so cute and so old.
- Yeah, look at this.
- [sighs] [softly] Oh, my God.
His whole snout's gray now.
- [chuckles]
- Has it really been that long?
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
Um... [smacks lips]
- Dustin, this is Gus.
- Hello.
- Hey.
- Gus, this is Dustin.

He takes after you.
He's got your eyes.

Because if I was with Dustin now, then I wouldn't be here with you.
That's sweet.
Here we go.
[car lock beeps] [sighs] All right.
[scoffs] Okay, I gotta ask.
Why do you always have a beach towel in your backseat?
Uh...
I don't know.
It's kind of a aspirational thing, like...
I hope that one day I can go to the beach and use that towel.
So you've never actually used it?
No.
I mean, I've... put it on wet grass at the park, but it's never touched sand.
- Let's go right now.
- To the beach?
Yeah.
Why not?
Okay.
Let's give this towel the best day of its life.
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's road trip.

I gotta admit.
This is pretty nice.
[Gus] Yeah.
[Mickey] It's the best day I've had in a long time.
Yeah, me too.
It's funny though, when something like this is, like, going really well...

We're gonna find it out eventually, may as well get it over with.
All right, that makes sense.
Yeah.
You go first.
Um, let me think.
Okay, uh...
If you can't think of it right away, you've never done anything that bad.
No, I'm just stalling, trying to come up with a way not to tell you this.
You can't.

And, um...
I did.
- I...
I took a shit in my hand.
- Okay.
And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
"Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."
Yeah, I can't play this game with you.
You're an amateur.
You can't do that.
That's cheating.
Just tell me your fifth-worst thing.
[Gus] Okay.
All right.
Let's go.
- No, thank you, sir.
- What?
- You have to.
- No!
Are you kidding me?
It's super polluted, and it's really cold.
My mom sent me this whole article about how all the city's run-off ends up in the ocean.

[laughing] Don't make me sound awful.
- [laughs]
- Like I'm a terrible human being.
Okay, come on.
Right.
That's good.
- [Mickey] All right.
No!
- All right.
Okay.
That's good.
Okay.
All right.
Wait for it.
- All right.
- Here it is.
[Mickey] God, here it comes.
- Oh, no.
- [Gus] Here we go.
- [Mickey screams] - [laughing] Yeah!
It happened!
It fucking happened.
We didn't think it would.

Dear Lord... please forgive me.
I was a fool.
I thought You'd betrayed me, and all I could hear was my own anger.
But now I know.
You have chosen me.
You have a purpose for me.
You said to Jeremiah, "Call to Me,
"and I will answer you,
"and I will tell you great and mighty things which you do not know."
Well, here I am, God... calling to You.
I am Your servant.
Reveal my path to me, and I shall do everything You demand.
Your will be done.
Water's perfect.
You coming?
I haven't been in the pool in five years.
That's a fucking shame.
People lucky enough to have a pool should pay a fine if they don't use it once a month.
Open it to the public.
Even better.
You reading the obituaries?
I'm trying to see if there's going to be a funeral for her, but I can't find it.
The Natasha girl?
Yeah.
I should be there.
Okay.
Whatever gets your ass out of the house.
- Don't.
- Uch, Crys, this is just...
This is so stupid.
I get that you're spooked.
So am I.
But you don't know that that cop shot her.
I heard his voice.
Then you call the FBI.
You call the fucking DEA.
Anybody with badges and guns.
And say what?
So you do nothing?
Forever?
I love you, honey, and boy, do I love hanging out by your fucking pool.
But I can't be your babysitter for the rest of your life.
I told you when I got here that I could only stay till today.
Wait, wait.
Just one more day, please.
Why?
If you're not going to do anything, how will tomorrow be any different than today?
If you don't trust the cops, you should at least call Pernell.
I got a letter from our landlord today.
60 day notice.
Guess what.
They can kiss my ass.
This is our home.
This is the home of truth.
You know, that's why they don't want us here.
They don't want us to tell the truth.
But because you do...
You want the truth.
- Paul...
- You need to know...
Alicia, I...
I just wrinkled up the letter.
I have one chance to do it fresh.
Okay.
You need to see this.
You need to see this.
I already called the cops.
Thanks.
Just ask him to leave.
If he refuses, don't push it.
Just wait for the cops.
Actually, Holly, I'll talk to him.
There he is, the skeptic.
You still mad at God?
Here I am.
Take it out on me.
I don't want to fight.
Why are you in our chapel?
We worship God here.
We've been found.
So have I.
I believe.
We don't want you here.
Why not?
Aren't all believers welcome?
You don't believe.
Yes, I do.
I'm anointed.
No.
You need help.
This is why I'm here.
God is sending me messages through this pen.
I would like for you to help me understand it.
All right, you might think you're anointed.
You're not going to get my help again.
I am telling you that everything you told me was right.
- I see that now.
- You hurt people.
Bad people who I never would have found without God's guidance and your help.
A few days ago, you wanted to kill me because you didn't think there was a God.
And now you're back to thinking you're anointed?
When did that change?
When I realized that God kept His promise.
You remember Tessie?
Yeah, your call girl.
My wife.
She's pregnant.
It's a boy.
My boy.
Your hooker wife is pregnant, and you think that makes you anointed?
God didn't give PJ back to me, but he did give me a son.
He answered me.
Just... not in the way that I expected.
I'm glad you believe again.
I truly hope you can walk your path with Jesus by your side, but this is not the church for you.
Who's the nonbeliever now?
You okay, Judge Harris?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know what it's like...
I saw this video one time where this deaf kid got an operation so he could hear for the first time.
These cochlear implants they got.
Anyway, after the operation, they set him down at this table, and, and they tapped one, but they haven't turned the thing on yet, so he doesn't hear anything.
And then they turn on the device, and they tap... and the kid... he starts bawling.
That's all it took...
A little tap.
That's how I feel, Keith.
Like I've been going through life with no sound, and now everything I hear is a miracle.
That's how it is for me, too, Judge Harris.
When I first met you in that courtroom, it was like somebody tapped on the table.
You've been right all along.
I'm so sorry I made you wait.
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with patience.
Well... the waiting's over.
We're going to put an end to this fucking trial.
Shane Caldwell's wife said that there's a video that I would pay good money for.
Does she have it?
I don't think so, but she definitely knows what's on it.
I want to start there.
Bring her to me.
Yes, sir.
She's not going to come by choice.
Not the same old steakhouse here, right?
Every once in a while, you got to change up the rhythm.
Half the kitchen staff here is from El Salvador.
This is what they cook for themselves.
I thought so.
There's pepperoni in this papusa.
Yeah, these guys pick up some new flavors from el norte.
You want to get some slaw on that.
It's good stuff.
You ever been to El Salvador?
Beautiful.
You should take your lady there some time.
Or your man or whatever.
Just go for yourself.
What the hell.
Went down there for my third honeymoon.
If I'm smart, it's my last.
You ever been married?
No.
Yeah.
Mach dot This, eHookUp, whatever.
Everyone keeps asking like it's so hard to get into a relationship.
It ain't half as hard as getting out of one.
You know what I mean?
I was wondering when we'd get around to having this conversation.
- Two more beers.
- At once.
Go ahead.
Okay.
San Vicente politics have run on Harris family money for forever.
It's a bad relationship, which gives you a real opportunity here...
A chance to turn being the biggest employer in San Vicente to being a political force.
But there are going to be some people you need to have on your side.
People you could persuade?
A lot of them are more loyal to the Harris family money than they are to Pernell.
You know anything about Africanized honeybees?
Word is they have extra-big stingers.
That's probably a myth.
What they have is a uniquely political behavior, even for social insects.
When they find another hive, they send a few workers over.
They cling to the hive, make themselves known to the local bees, communicate, share food.
So when an African queen shows up to take over, they welcome her as one of their own.
Here we are.
I paid for two clinics, a park, a quarter of the REAL Initiative so far.
Yes, you have.
Senior elections are coming up, and there's going to be campaigns to fund.
You get the right friends in line, it's going to take bigger moves and deeper pockets.
What if I fully funded the REAL Initiative myself?
No Harris money.
No fundraisers, that sort of move?
Well, yeah.
That would make an impression.
You understand that once the process of taking over a hive begins, it can become chaotic.
There can be no order until the new power structure's in place.
Like humans, like bees, right?
Not really.
Humans sometimes tolerate multiple loyalties, but a hive can only have one queen.
Then I say viva la fucking bees.
Here we are, sir.
Wine list and menu.
Both Boss Hogs.
Thanks.
- It's proper.
- No.
Kaplan couldn't fucking believe it, but the judge sustained it.
He says if the dog is in the will, it has standing to contest.
His face goes all red!
Hey, let's get out of here, okay?
Ahem.
Caldwell's wife is gone.
Gone shopping or gone gone?
Clothes missing, the flowers are dead, and the milk's gone sour.
Seems like she left in a hurry.
Maybe somebody made her leave.
Didn't want her talking to me.
I took some mail and stuff.
Should help us track her down.
If she's traveling with a kid, it's going to make it easier.
She's got a sister in Ukiah.
Well, that day may come, but it's not today.
God gave me the meaning of another one of my visions.
What was it?
You know Proverbs 25:19?
Yeah.
Something about teeth?
That's the one.
I can call another vote for the Harris High name change, but it won't matter.
It's still going to be 4-3 in Pernell Harris' favor.
Why poke the bear?
Do you hear yourself?
You're basically saying that you're more afraid of Pernell Harris than of Robert Boston, and that's okay.
I don't want you to be scared of me.
I want you to believe in me.
I'm at the top of my game, and next year I'll be re-elected in a cakewalk, and he will be on trial for murder.
See what I mean?
You know I love you, Robert, but my position is not appointed.
I have to run, just like you, and the Harris family is my biggest donor, by far, every election.
You don't need them anymore, Gloria.
You got name recognition now.
- How do you think I got that?
- Gloria, stop.
I need you to trust me.
Put the vote back on the agenda for next week.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor.
Looks like Pernell RSVP'd to your party.
- You're kidding me.
- Plus one, which I have no idea who that could be because Crystal already RSVP'd last week solo.
He's not coming to my party.
So you invite your three ex-wives but not your bestie?
Yes.
Once he becomes my ex-friend long enough, then he'll get invited again.
But not this year.
Okay.
I'll send an email.
No.
No.
You deliver that message in person.
Me?
Yes.
You should be afraid of me.
- Um...
- I'll do it, Pops.
I'll have Cam drive me.
Crys?
Honey...
I got to go.
I want to get home before dark.
- This doesn't make sense.
- What?
The ME's report.
It's just...
It's bullshit.
What's wrong with it?
It says that she was shot during a drug deal.
They found a pipe in a bag and empty meth phials everywhere.
Well, maybe she was a part-time user.
She wasn't a tweaker.
She was a hacker.
She was a brilliant one.
PJ got high, didn't he?
You do.
I was on the phone with her.
She was not buying drugs.
Guy next door was.
Wrong place wrong time.
That is not what happened!
This is just...
It's a cover-up.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm trying to make this right.
Are you?
Or are you trying to make yourself feel better because you fucked up?
You didn't kill her.
She'd be alive today if I didn't talk her into going.
Crys, you can't control everything!
And I know that's what you like to do.
You've always done that, and it's gotten you really far from where you started.
But you are drinking your own Kool-Aid if you think you've ever been in charge.
Shit happens.
Life is gonna fuck you.
You have nothing to do with it.
She didn't deserve to die like that.
She was a...
She was a fucking kid.
Just like PJ?
Is that what this is?
Bright kids are going to go where they go.
They're going to do what they do.
They're going to love who they love, and... we don't get to choose.
I'll call you when I get home.
Come in.
Hey.
Asa.
How you doing, Pernell?
Great.
My dad is not coming.
Have a seat.
Nah.
This isn't gonna take long.
He doesn't want you at his party.
If you show up, they'll stop you at the door.
They'll s...
I haven't missed one of your father's birthday parties in 20-something years.
Might be time to start a new tradition, right?
I know I fucked up, but, I mean, how am I going to make it right if I can't talk to him?
Every time you do talk to him, you make something else wrong.
Listen, Pernell, it's just not a good time.
He wants to regain some control over his life, make his own decisions.
If they can't track us, they can't control us, you know?
What do you mean by that?
PJ said that in a video.
You heard it before, right?
Maybe.
I don't remember.
What's that have to do with your old man's birthday party?
Nothing.
I just figured you'd heard it.
Look, just steer clear tomorrow night, all right?
There's been enough static.
There's things he needs to know, Asa.
So tell me.
I'll tell him.
Nah.
This is just for him.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you post it?
Not yet.
I don't know if I want to.
Why not?
I mean, that guy who beat your ass a week ago was here begging for forgiveness.
I'd think our followers would eat that up.
What if he's right?
About what?
Being chosen.
He's crazy.
Don't let him suck you in.
Whatever money he might give us, it's not worth the trouble.
I'm not thinking about the money.
Paul, he's a murderer.
Why are we even having this conversation?
Why did God choose Saul, a man who killed hundreds of Christians, to become His apostle?
Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene, a whore, to be His travel companion?
- Stop it.
- I'm just saying that God's ways are mysterious...
Sometimes.
But Pernell's aren't.
I don't care if he starts walking on water.
I don't want him here.
He's dangerous.
Sorry I called you so late.
What's going on, Crys?
If I let you come back, you okay with the guest room?
I fucking love the guest room.
A knife?
Why do you have that?
Crystal.
What the fuck's going on?
Wilson's dead.
What?
She went to that meeting.
He shot her.
Who shot her?
Chief Clay.
Toby?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.
Come here.
Were you there?
So how do you know it was Toby?
I heard his voice.
I was on the phone with her.
I heard everything.
Now I feel like he's always right outside the door... and he's waiting for me, and I don't know what to do.
First thing you're gonna do is get some sleep.
There's nobody outside that door.
Nobody's going to hurt you, not while I'm here.
We're going to figure all this shit out in the morning.
Thank you.
You got a little more junk in your trunk these days.
Been a busy month.
Here.
This one.
Are you sure about that?
I don't give a fuck, Fortune.
They all look good.
Okay.
Make my job a little easier.
Now, maybe next time,
I'll just have a suit off the rack from Macy's.
Hey, look, I didn't mean it like that.
You know.
Come on.
What do you think?
Nice.
Want to talk to me about the Valco tract?
No.
Want me to talk to you about the Valco tract?
We're done here, Fortune.
I just need my box.
Bobo, you're playing games with yourself.
You told me that the Shane Caldwell connection meant nothing.
That Valco order was going to be signed, no matter what.
It won't look that way.
Do you honestly think that I'm the only person that knows how to connect the dots?
There aren't any dots to connect.
Really?
There's no dots?
Well, let me tell you what I found in two days.
Shane Caldwell... dot.
Eminent domain order for the Valco tract... dot.
Holding companies that own land around the Brooks development... dot, two of which I've already been able to connect to the Harris Family Trust...
Dot dot.
And the value of the land has tripled since construction started...
- Dot-dot-dot.
- Dot-dot-dot-goose.
I get it.
You're so good at what you do.
Now I understand why you didn't want to testify.
I didn't do anything illegal.
Don't aim too high now.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You think I'm any different than any other politician?
I used to.
Izzy, you been around long enough.
You know what it is.
I don't make the rules.
The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
And it was hanging on by a thread.
So I had to make Pernell happy to get the deal done.
- That's it.
- But blaming Pernell is not going to make you look any better, Bobo.
Of course not.
But it is his fault, the reason why I'm in this position.
That you're looking at me with disappointment in your eyes.
I...
I got Brooks Innovation setting up shop in my city.
I'm launching a $40 million education initiative.
I've got 500 people coming to my birthday party thinking I'm the toast of the town.
But the truth of the matter is what?
I'm one trial away from my whole legacy going up in smoke.
And that's his fault.
That's his fault.
See what I mean?
Crys, you do realize that Toby doesn't know that you know he killed Wilson, right?
You don't know what he knows.
I know he knows where you live.
And I know he has dozens of plausible reasons for his guys to storm in here and start shooting and you end up accidentally dead.
But that hasn't happened, and he's had days.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
So what is it?
I called her this morning.
Wilson's...
Natasha's mother.
Aw, shit.
I told her what happened to Natasha wasn't her fault.
No, it wasn't.
And I told her that... the bag was mine and I made her score drugs for me.
Jesus.
Why would you do that, Crys?
Because maybe I can't control everything.
But Toby Clay put a bullet in her little girl's throat, and that woman deserves somebody to hate.
Maybe hate's not the right answer.
Sometimes it's all a mother has left.
Dear Lord, please lead him to speak with truth and enlightenment so that we may find the next step in our path.
- Amen.
- Amen.
So this neurologist that I was seeing... he said that the brain, under stress... can have these episodes.
It may seem like hallucinations, but, um, it's really the brain in overdrive making these connections that you would never see otherwise.
You think that's possible?
I mean, it's plausible, right?
So this thing that's been bugging me,
I kept having these visions of your teeth falling out, and I couldn't figure it out.
And then I saw you yesterday, and it hit me.
You know your Bible, Adam?
Proverbs 25:19?
Relying on a treacherous man in time of trouble is like chewing with a broken tooth.
A treacherous man.
That's you, Adam.
Lose the gag.
You can talk now if you want.
It's what you're good at, isn't it?
You're out of your mind if you think you can get away with this.
Chances are I'm getting a lethal injection, so you don't think I give a fuck what I can get away with, do you?
You, on the other hand, should be very concerned because you're on trial, too, and I'm the judge, so bang-bang-bang, court's in session.
First and only witness, Mr. Adam Regis.
Help!
Nope.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Careful, Adam.
My bailiff is very enthusiastic.
How did they get you to sell me out?
Did they pay you?
Or was it as easy as just asking?
I...
I didn't do anything.
Aah!
Aah!
Perjury is a very serious offense in this courtroom, Mr. Regis.
Please.
I didn't.
Adam, Adam.
When I went to see that doctor in San Francisco, they got a photo of me on the Bay Bridge.
They knew exactly where I was going to be, when I was going to be there, and only one other motherfucker on this planet knew that information, so please cut the shit.
Or maybe we could put your mother on the stand.
I mean, Keith can find her anywhere any time.
No, I didn't...
So who did you report to?
Was it McCauley?
Toby?
Or both?
Toby!
To-Toby!
Just Toby!
Good.
Now, you see how easy that was?
By the way, you're still fucking guilty.
Please.
- So...
- Please.
Let's talk about restitution.
W-What do you mean?
Well, there's a reason why my friend left your pretty face untouched.
Something you're going to do for me, Adam.
Or we could go the other way.
What other way?
No.
No, please.
Please.
Death... or restitution.
Here we go.
No more bets.
Thanks for your vote.
Glad you could make it.
I appreciate it.
Come on, everybody.
Have a good time.
The drinks are free.
Ooh.
Sorry.
Yeah.
This way.
Smile.
Shit.
Look, honey.
Look at me.
You're safe.
I promise.
Just smile.
You'll be fine.
Hey!
Good evening, Mrs. Harris, judge.
Can you hold on a moment?
Hey, Asa.
Boy, you're looking good tonight.
Pernell, what are you doing here?
This is not part of our agreement.
I'm not taking my wife through the kitchen, Ace.
Fine.
Fuck.
Whatever.
Let's go.
I'll go get myself a drink.
Or three.
Come on, Pernell.
You having a good time?
Go get whatever you want.
If she'd have known
I'd be balling like this one day, she'd have had a little more patience with me.
How long since you're divorced?
11 years now.
And you're still concerned with what she thinks?
Well, that's not why I invited her.
This is to remind her she fucked up.
Ha ha.
Hey, Mr. Brooks, sorry.
I need him a minute.
Okay.
What's up?
He came.
- Who?
- Pernell.
Come on, Ace.
Pops, you would really rather spend your birthday with Nathan Brooks?
That's supposed to be my choice.
Look, you know how sentimental he can be.
Just give him a few minutes.
Maybe he'll go home.
Well, shit.
I knew it.
Where is he?
I put him in the pool room.
It's the billiard room, not the pool room.
So do you play billiards in there, or do you shoot pool?
You know what?
I need another drink for this one.
Go tell him I'll be there in ten minutes.
All right.
Mrs. Harris.
Jesus.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
No, no, you're not.
You're bleeding.
Can I get a first aid kit here, please?
I should just go to the bathroom.
There's a shard in there.
You don't need any stitches, but you're bleeding a lot.
It's because your heart is racing.
Try taking some deep breaths.
Not so good with blood?
I think I should go to the ER.
Shh.
Hold on.
There.
You got blood on your hand.
Here we are, Mrs. Harris.
I'll take care of this in no time.
I don't suppose you want to shoot a rack.
If anything gets shot in here, it's going to be you.
You were asked not to come.
Got you a present.
What is it, a horse's head?
I mean, it's your birthday, motherfucker.
Can you please just lighten up?
My son said you wanted to talk.
We've been talking.
You done yet?
Remember that time...
Ida stepped out on Papa Gene?
Look, if you came here to talk shit about my mother,
I will put my foot up your ass.
What was the name of that motherfucker she went out with?
Weird little dude.
He's got a beard under here, some shit.
Marion Townsend.
Marion Townsend.
Yeah.
I never did understand what she saw in him.
It was the Mercedes that caught her eye.
A janitor's wife don't get that kind of ride at home.
Right.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car.
He brought it home.
He put it back on his Caprice.
What did he call it?
The...
The Merchevy.
The Merchevy, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He kept swapping that thing from car to car until my mother passed.
She never stepped out on him again, though.
I mean, you know, things went south for a little while, but they made it right.
You know.
She stuck with him... till she died.
I'm tired of you and me playing games, Pernell.
Let me ask you a question.
You really think it was some symbolic gesture that kept my folks together?
I do think symbols matter.
Get you started, maybe.
Get you a night, maybe a week.
But things add up over time, and it takes more than symbols to get past it all.
What got my folks through another couple of decades was honesty.
Really?
Honesty about what?
Everything, my man.
Whatever you want to know... just ask.
What happened to Shane?
What's the matter, you don't gamble?
My stomach's bothering me.
Too much rich food.
Too much Pernell.
What's the hottest girl at the party doing hanging out all by herself?
Nursing my wound.
Holy shit.
What happened?
Broke a glass.
Guess who insisted on administering first aid.
Pernell tried to apologize to me.
That's great.
See if you can spin that into something more.
Toby, there's a video.
Of what?
I don't know, but he thinks it's going to get him off.
I'm going to deal with Toby.
No.
Now is not the time to go in hot.
Did it ever occur to you that I just might have a plan?
Why don't I get the driver to take you home?
No.
I'm staying.
He can't hurt me here.
Fuck him.
All right.
See you at home.
Gorgeous.
Hey.
You okay?
Come on.
Let's cut the cake.
Fireworks.
I've never been to a party with fireworks.
There he is.
Thank you, thank you.
You've got great singing voices.
Thank you so much.
Um...
You know what?
All year long, you all have to listen to me make speeches and go off about whatever the hell is so important on that day.
So tonight
I'm going to give you all a present:
No speeches.
You like that.
You like that one, yeah.
No, seriously, thank you all for coming, and, um... here's hoping we can do this again 48 years from now.
Thank you.
Can we get the fire department here?
Because this is...
This is dangerous.
You know what?
I got my team here.
We'll take care of it.
Be careful what you wish for.
Let's bring it in.
Cut the cake!
Enjoy the party.
Enjoy the party.
You know, he doesn't have to come back out.
Nah.
Regis scared him by telling him about the video.
I want to know who he came running to about it.
We have a fucking problem.
Do you know that somewhere in this building there is a shipment of Justin Bieber wigs?
I'm not mocking your being bald.
You're always so fucking amused.
We all make choices.
Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know
I killed that hacker chick?
Well, guess what.
She does.
She didn't know a few days ago.
Well, she sure as shit knows now!
She about jumped out of her skin when she saw me tonight.
And her fucking husband's got some video Caldwell made that's going to blow up his case?
I sincerely doubt that.
You can afford doubt.
I need certainty.
I need you to make sure that she never talks.
Crystal Harris is going to find Bathwater for me.
I could give a flying fuck about Bathwater!
You don't need to give a flying fuck.
Give a flying fuck about passionately is what I want, and what I want is Crystal Harris alive and free until she finishes the job.
I don't want to...
mess up our arrangement, but I can't have Crystal walking around out there.
What could she prove?
What can she prove?
Nothing.
And I wouldn't worry about the video.
Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
I do.
You...
You motherfucker.
Give it to me.
No.
- Give it to me.
- No.
It's clearly best for both of us if I have some influence over your actions.
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker.
Shit.
Fuck this.
Keith!
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm all right, I think.
Just a nick.
Who did this?
Quick little fucker.
Dark hair, beard.
He told Toby he has the tape.
Heh.
Now that's good.
Please, God.
"You were right."
"The gun is going to protect you."
Evening, Judge Harris.
Manny, um... give me some of your,
Balvenie 40 year, would you?
You know that's $500 a shot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Better make it a double.
Celebrating?
No, I'm just trying to make the most of my last few days of freedom.
You'll beat it, sir.
Your lips to God's ears, Manny.
You a lefty?
The only people I see using Mont Blanc ballpoints are lefties.
They can't use fountain pens.
Right, because there's too much smear.
Yeah, my son got me this as a gift.
Yeah, he understood because...
You all right?
Pernell?
You okay?
Page 2.
Line 18, section C.
Shit.
Fuck.
No.
I don't want to look at this.
Read it, Crys.
"Based on fingerprints,
"victim-held gun in left hand when firing fatal shot."
They fucked up, Crys.
They saw PJ write his suicide note with his left hand, so they assumed he was left-handed, so that's where they put the gun.
Except PJ did everything else right-handed.
So why would he have a gun in his left hand?
He wouldn't.
Exactly.
Our son didn't shoot himself, Crys.
He was murdered.
Dear Lord... please forgive me.
I was a fool.
I thought You'd betrayed me, and all I could hear was my own anger.
But now I know.
You have chosen me.
You have a purpose for me.
You said to Jeremiah, "Call to Me,
"and I will answer you,
"and I will tell you great and mighty things which you do not know."
Well, here I am, God... calling to You.
I am Your servant.
Reveal my path to me, and I shall do everything You demand.
Your will be done.
Water's perfect.
You coming?
I haven't been in the pool in five years.
Oh, that's a fucking shame.
People lucky enough to have a pool should pay a fine if they don't use it once a month.
Open it to the public.
Even better.
You reading the obituaries?
I'm trying to see if there's going to be a funeral for her, but I can't find it.
The Natasha girl?
Yeah.
I should be there.
Oh.
Okay.
Whatever gets your ass out of the house.
- Don't.
- Uch, Crys, this is just-- this is so stupid.
I get that you're spooked.
So am I.
But you don't know that that cop shot her.
I heard his voice.
Then you call the FBI.
You call the fucking DEA.
Anybody with badges and guns.
And say what?
So you do nothing?
Forever?
I love you, honey, and boy, do I love hanging out by your fucking pool.
But I can't be your babysitter for the rest of your life.
I told you when I got here that I could only stay till today.
Wait, wait.
Just one more day, please.
Why?
If you're not going to do anything, how will tomorrow be any different than today?
If you don't trust the cops, you should at least call Pernell.
I got a letter from our landlord today.
60 day notice.
Guess what.
They can kiss my ass.
This is our home.
This is the home of truth.
You know, that's why they don't want us here.
They don't want us to tell the truth.
But because you do-- You want the truth.
- Paul--
- You need to know--
Alicia, I-
- I just wrinkled up the letter.
I have one chance to do it fresh.
Okay.
You need to see this.
You need to see this.
I already called the cops.
Thanks.
Just ask him to leave.
If he refuses, don't push it.
Just wait for the cops.
Actually, Holly, I'll talk to him.
There he is, the skeptic.
You still mad at God?
Here I am.
Take it out on me.
I don't want to fight.
Why are you in our chapel?
We worship God here.
We've been found.
So have I.
I believe.
We don't want you here.
Why not?
Aren't all believers welcome?
You don't believe.
Yes, I do.
I'm anointed.
No.
You need help.
This is why I'm here.
God is sending me messages through this pen.
I would like for you to help me understand it.
All right, you might think you're anointed.
You're not going to get my help again.
I am telling you that everything you told me was right.
- I see that now.
- You hurt people.
Bad people who I never would have found without God's guidance and your help.
A few days ago, you wanted to kill me because you didn't think there was a God.
And now you're back to thinking you're anointed?
When did that change?
When I realized that God kept His promise.
You remember Tessie?
Yeah, your call girl.
My wife.
She's pregnant.
It's a boy.
My boy.
Your hooker wife is pregnant, and you think that makes you anointed?
God didn't give PJ back to me, but he did give me a son.
He answered me.
Just...not in the way that I expected.
I'm glad you believe again.
I truly hope you can walk your path with Jesus by your side, but this is not the church for you.
Who's the nonbeliever now?
You okay, Judge Harris?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know what it's like...
I saw this video one time where this deaf kid got an operation so he could hear for the first time.
These cochlear implants they got.
Anyway, after the operation, they set him down at this table, and, uh, and they tapped one, but they haven't turned the thing on yet, so he doesn't hear anything.
And then they turn on the device, and they tap... and the kid... he starts bawling.
That's all it took-- a little tap.
That's how I feel, Keith.
Like I've been going through life with no sound, and now everything I hear is a miracle.
That's how it is for me, too, Judge Harris.
When I first met you in that courtroom, it was like somebody tapped on the table.
You've been right all along.
I'm so sorry I made you wait.
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with patience.
Well... the waiting's over.
We're going to put an end to this fucking trial.
Shane Caldwell's wife said that there's a video that I would pay good money for.
Does she have it?
I don't think so, but she definitely knows what's on it.
I want to start there.
Bring her to me.
Yes, sir.
She's not going to come by choice.
Not the same old steakhouse here, right?
Every once in a while, you got to change up the rhythm.
Half the kitchen staff here is from El Salvador.
This is what they cook for themselves.
I thought so.
There's pepperoni in this papusa.
Yeah, these guys pick up some new flavors from el norte.
You want to get some slaw on that.
It's good stuff.
You ever been to El Salvador?
Beautiful.
You should take your lady there some time.
Or your man or whatever.
Just go for yourself.
What the hell.
Went down there for my third honeymoon.
If I'm smart, it's my last.
You ever been married?
No.
Yeah.
Mach dot This, eHookUp, whatever.
Everyone keeps asking like it's so hard to get into a relationship.
It ain't half as hard as getting out of one.
You know what I mean?
I was wondering when we'd get around to having this conversation.
- Two more beers.
- At once.
Go ahead.
Okay.
San Vicente politics have run on Harris family money for forever.
It's a bad relationship, which gives you a real opportunity here-- a chance to turn being the biggest employer in San Vicente to being a political force.
But there are going to be some people you need to have on your side.
People you could persuade?
A lot of them are more loyal to the Harris family money than they are to Pernell.
You know anything about Africanized honeybees?
Word is they have extra-big stingers.
That's probably a myth.
What they have is a uniquely political behavior, even for social insects.
When they find another hive, they send a few workers over.
They cling to the hive, make themselves known to the local bees, communicate, share food.
So when an African queen shows up to take over, they welcome her as one of their own.
Here we are.
I paid for two clinics, a park, a quarter of the REAL Initiative so far.
Yes, you have.
Senior elections are coming up, and there's going to be campaigns to fund.
You get the right friends in line, it's going to take bigger moves and deeper pockets.
What if I fully funded the REAL Initiative myself?
No Harris money.
No fundraisers, that sort of move?
Well, yeah.
That would make an impression.
You understand that once the process of taking over a hive begins, it can become chaotic.
There can be no order until the new power structure's in place.
Like humans, like bees, right?
Not really.
Humans sometimes tolerate multiple loyalties, but a hive can only have one queen.
Then I say viva la fucking bees.
Here we are, sir.
Wine list and menu.
Both Boss Hogs.
Thanks.
- It's proper.
- No.
Kaplan couldn't fucking believe it, but the judge sustained it.
He says if the dog is in the will, it has standing to contest.
His face goes all red!
Hey, uh, let's get out of here, okay?
Ahem.
Caldwell's wife is gone.
Gone shopping or gone gone?
Clothes missing, the flowers are dead, and the milk's gone sour.
Seems like she left in a hurry.
Maybe somebody made her leave.
Didn't want her talking to me.
I took some mail and stuff.
Should help us track her down.
If she's traveling with a kid, it's going to make it easier.
She's got a sister in Ukiah.
Well, that day may come, but it's not today.
God gave me the meaning of another one of my visions.
What was it?
You know Proverbs 25:19?
Yeah.
Something about teeth?
That's the one.
I can call another vote for the Harris High name change, but it won't matter.
It's still going to be 4-3 in Pernell Harris' favor.
Why poke the bear?
Do you hear yourself?
You're basically saying that you're more afraid of Pernell Harris than of Robert Boston, and that's okay.
I don't want you to be scared of me.
I want you to believe in me.
I'm at the top of my game, and next year I'll be re-elected in a cakewalk, and he will be on trial for murder.
See what I mean?
You know I love you, Robert, but my position is not appointed.
I have to run, just like you, and the Harris family is my biggest donor, by far, every election.
You don't need them anymore, Gloria.
You got name recognition now.
- How do you think I got that?
- Gloria, stop.
I need you to trust me.
Put the vote back on the agenda for next week.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor.
Looks like Pernell RSVP'd to your party.
- You're kidding me.
- Plus one, which I have no idea who that could be because Crystal already RSVP'd last week solo.
He's not coming to my party.
So you invite your three ex-wives but not your bestie?
Yes.
Once he becomes my ex-friend long enough, then he'll get invited again.
But not this year.
Okay.
I'll send an email.
No.
No.
You deliver that message in person.
Me?
Yes.
You should be afraid of me.
- Um...
- I'll do it, Pops.
I'll have Cam drive me.
Crys?
Honey--
I got to go.
I want to get home before dark.
- This doesn't make sense.
- What?
The ME's report.
It's just-
- It's bullshit.
What's wrong with it?
It says that she was shot during a drug deal.
They found a pipe in a bag and empty meth phials everywhere.
Well, maybe she was a part-time user.
She wasn't a tweaker.
She was a hacker.
She was a brilliant one.
PJ got high, didn't he?
You do.
I was on the phone with her.
She was not buying drugs.
Guy next door was.
Wrong place wrong time.
That is not what happened!
This is just-- It's a cover-up.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm trying to make this right.
Are you?
Or are you trying to make yourself feel better because you fucked up?
You didn't kill her.
She'd be alive today if I didn't talk her into going.
Crys, you can't control everything!
And I know that's what you like to do.
You've always done that, and it's gotten you really far from where you started.
But you are drinking your own Kool-Aid if you think you've ever been in charge.
Shit happens.
Life is gonna fuck you.
You have nothing to do with it.
She didn't deserve to die like that.
She was a--
She was a fucking kid.
Just like PJ, huh?
Is that what this is?
Bright kids are going to go where they go.
They're going to do what they do.
They're going to love who they love, and... we don't get to choose.
I'll call you when I get home.
Uh--
Uhh.
Come in.
Hey.
Asa.
How you doing, Pernell?
Great.
My dad is not coming.
Oh.
Oh.
Have a seat.
Nah.
This isn't gonna take long.
He doesn't want you at his party.
If you show up, they'll stop you at the door.
They'll s--
I haven't missed one of your father's birthday parties in 20-something years.
Might be time to start a new tradition, right?
I know I fucked up, but, I mean, how am I going to make it right if I can't talk to him?
Every time you do talk to him, you make something else wrong.
Listen, Pernell, it's just not a good time.
He wants to regain some control over his life, make his own decisions.
If they can't track us, they can't control us, you know?
What do you mean by that?
PJ said that in a video.
You heard it before, right?
Maybe.
I don't remember.
What's that have to do with your old man's birthday party?
Nothing.
I just figured you'd heard it.
Look, just steer clear tomorrow night, all right?
There's been enough static.
There's things he needs to know, Asa.
So tell me.
I'll tell him.
Nah.
This is just for him.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you post it?
Not yet.
I don't know if I want to.
Why not?
I mean, that guy who beat your ass a week ago was here begging for forgiveness.
I'd think our followers would eat that up.
What if he's right?
About what?
Being chosen.
He's crazy.
Don't let him suck you in.
Whatever money he might give us, it's not worth the trouble.
I'm not thinking about the money.
Paul, he's a murderer.
Why are we even having this conversation?
Why did God choose Saul, a man who killed hundreds of Christians, to become His apostle?
Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene, a whore, to be His travel companion?
- Stop it.
- I'm just saying that God's ways are mysterious-- sometimes.
But Pernell's aren't.
I don't care if he starts walking on water.
I don't want him here.
He's dangerous.
Sorry I called you so late.
What's going on, Crys?
If I let you come back, you okay with the guest room?
I fucking love the guest room.
A knife?
Why do you have that?
Crystal.
What the fuck's going on?
Wilson's dead.
What?
She went to that meeting.
He shot her.
Who shot her?
Chief Clay.
Toby?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.
Come here.
Oh.
Were you there?
Mm-mm.
So how do you know it was Toby?
I heard his voice.
I was on the phone with her.
I heard everything.
Now I feel like he's always right outside the door... and he's waiting for me, and I don't know what to do.
First thing you're gonna do is get some sleep.
There's nobody outside that door.
Nobody's going to hurt you, not while I'm here.
We're going to figure all this shit out in the morning.
Thank you.
Oh.
You got a little more junk in your trunk these days.
Been a busy month.
Here.
This one.
Hmm.
Are you sure about that?
I don't give a fuck, Fortune.
They all look good.
Oh.
Okay.
Make my job a little easier.
Now, maybe next time,
I'll just have a suit off the rack from Macy's.
Hey, look, I didn't mean it like that.
- Uh-huh.
- You know.
Come on.
What do you think?
Nice.
Want to talk to me about the Valco tract?
No.
Want me to talk to you about the Valco tract?
We're done here, Fortune.
I just need my box.
Bobo, you're playing games with yourself.
You told me that the Shane Caldwell connection meant nothing.
That Valco order was going to be signed, no matter what.
It won't look that way.
Do you honestly think that I'm the only person that knows how to connect the dots?
There aren't any dots to connect.
Really?
There's no dots?
Well, let me tell you what I found in two days.
Shane Caldwell-- dot.
Eminent domain order for the Valco tract-- dot.
Holding companies that own land around the Brooks development-- dot, two of which I've already been able to connect to the Harris Family Trust-- dot dot.
And the value of the land has tripled since construction started- dot-dot-dot.
- Dot-dot-dot-goose.
I get it.
You're so good at what you do.
Now I understand why you didn't want to testify.
I didn't do anything illegal.
Mm.
Don't aim too high now.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You think I'm any different than any other politician?
I used to.
Izzy, you been around long enough.
You know what it is.
I don't make the rules.
The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
And it was hanging on by a thread.
So I had to make Pernell happy to get the deal done.
- That's it.
- But blaming Pernell is not going to make you look any better, Bobo.
Of course not.
But it is his fault, the reason why I'm in this position.
That you're looking at me with disappointment in your eyes.
I--
I got Brooks Innovation setting up shop in my city.
I'm launching a $40 million education initiative.
I've got 500 people coming to my birthday party thinking I'm the toast of the town.
But the truth of the matter is what?
I'm one trial away from my whole legacy going up in smoke.
And that's his fault.
That's his fault.
See what I mean?
Crys, you do realize that Toby doesn't know that you know he killed Wilson, right?
You don't know what he knows.
I know he knows where you live.
And I know he has dozens of plausible reasons for his guys to storm in here and start shooting and you end up accidentally dead.
But that hasn't happened, and he's had days.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
So what is it?
I called her this morning.
Wilson's-- Natasha's mother.
Aw, shit.
I told her what happened to Natasha wasn't her fault.
No, it wasn't.
And I told her that... the bag was mine and I made her score drugs for me.
Jesus.
Why would you do that, Crys?
Because maybe I can't control everything.
But Toby Clay put a bullet in her little girl's throat, and that woman deserves somebody to hate.
Maybe hate's not the right answer.
Sometimes it's all a mother has left.
Dear Lord, please lead him to speak with truth and enlightenment so that we may find the next step in our path.
- Amen.
- Amen.
So this neurologist that I was seeing... he said that the brain, under stress--
Mm.
...can have these episodes.
It may seem like hallucinations, but, um, it's really the brain in overdrive making these connections that you would never see otherwise.
You think that's possible?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, it's plausible, right?
So this thing that's been bugging me,
I kept having these visions of your teeth falling out, and I couldn't figure it out.
And then I saw you yesterday, and it hit me.
You know your Bible, Adam?
- Proverbs 25:19?
- Mm-mm.
Relying on a treacherous man in time of trouble is like chewing with a broken tooth.
A treacherous man.
That's you, Adam.
Mm-mm.
Mm.
Lose the gag.
You can talk now if you want.
It's what you're good at, isn't it?
You're out of your mind if you think you can get away with this.
Chances are I'm getting a lethal injection, so you don't think I give a fuck what I can get away with, do you?
You, on the other hand, should be very concerned because you're on trial, too, and I'm the judge, so bang-bang-bang, court's in session.
First and only witness, Mr. Adam Regis.
Help!
Nope.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Careful, Adam.
My bailiff is very enthusiastic.
How did they get you to sell me out?
Did they pay you?
Or was it as easy as just asking?
I-
- I didn't do anything.
Aah!
Aah!
Perjury is a very serious offense in this courtroom, Mr. Regis.
Please.
I didn't.
Adam, Adam.
When I went to see that doctor in San Francisco, they got a photo of me on the Bay Bridge.
They knew exactly where I was going to be, when I was going to be there, and only one other motherfucker on this planet knew that information, so please cut the shit.
Or maybe we could put your mother on the stand.
I mean, Keith can find her anywhere any time.
No, I didn't...
So who did you report to?
Was it McCauley?
Toby?
Or both?
Huh?
Toby!
To-Toby!
Just Toby!
Good.
Now, you see how easy that was?
Huh?
Oh, by the way, you're still fucking guilty.
Please.
- So--
- Please.
...let's talk about restitution.
W-What do you mean?
Well, there's a reason why my friend left your pretty face untouched.
Something you're going to do for me, Adam.
Or we could go the other way.
What other way?
No.
No, please.
Please.
Death... or restitution.
Here we go.
No more bets.
Thanks for your vote.
Glad you could make it.
I appreciate it.
Come on, everybody.
Have a good time.
The drinks are free.
Ooh.
Sorry.
Yeah.
This way.
Smile.
Oh, shit.
Look, honey.
Look at me.
You're safe.
I promise.
Just smile.
You'll be fine.
Hey!
Good evening, Mrs. Harris, judge.
Can you hold on a moment?
Hey, Asa.
Boy, you're looking good tonight.
Pernell, what are you doing here?
This is not part of our agreement.
I'm not taking my wife through the kitchen, Ace.
Fine.
Fuck.
Whatever.
Let's go.
I'll go get myself a drink.
Or three.
Come on, Pernell.
- You having a good time?
- Mm-hmm.
Go get whatever you want.
Ah, if she'd have known
I'd be balling like this one day, she'd have had a little more patience with me.
How long since you're divorced?
Uh, 11 years now.
And you're still concerned with what she thinks?
Well, that's not why I invited her.
This is to remind her she fucked up.
Ha ha.
Hey, Mr. Brooks, sorry.
I need him a minute.
Uh, okay.
What's up?
He came.
- Who?
- Pernell.
Come on, Ace.
Pops, you would really rather spend your birthday with Nathan Brooks?
That's supposed to be my choice.
Look, you know how sentimental he can be.
Just give him a few minutes.
Maybe he'll go home.
Well, shit.
I knew it.
Where is he?
I put him in the pool room.
It's the billiard room, not the pool room.
So do you play billiards in there, or do you shoot pool?
You know what?
I need another drink for this one.
Go tell him I'll be there in ten minutes.
All right.
Mrs. Harris.
Mm--
Jesus.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
No, no, you're not.
You're bleeding.
Can I get a first aid kit here, please?
I should just go to the bathroom.
There's a shard in there.
You don't need any stitches, but you're bleeding a lot.
It's because your heart is racing.
Try taking some deep breaths.
Not so good with blood?
I think I should go to the ER.
Shh.
Hold on.
There.
You got blood on your hand.
Here we are, Mrs. Harris.
I'll take care of this in no time.
I don't suppose you want to shoot a rack.
If anything gets shot in here, it's going to be you.
You were asked not to come.
Got you a present.
What is it, a horse's head?
I mean, it's your birthday, motherfucker.
Can you please just lighten up?
My son said you wanted to talk.
We've been talking.
You done yet?
Remember that time...
Ida stepped out on Papa Gene?
Look, if you came here to talk shit about my mother,
I will put my foot up your ass.
What was the name of that motherfucker she went out with?
Weird little dude.
He's got a beard under here, some shit.
Marion Townsend.
Marion Townsend.
Yeah.
I never did understand what she saw in him.
It was the Mercedes that caught her eye.
A janitor's wife don't get that kind of ride at home.
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car.
He brought it home.
He put it back on his Caprice.
What did he call it?
The, uh...
The Merchevy.
The Merchevy, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He kept swapping that thing from car to car until my mother passed.
She never stepped out on him again, though.
I mean, you know, things went south for a little while, but they made it right.
You know.
She stuck with him... till she died.
I'm tired of you and me playing games, Pernell.
Let me ask you a question.
You really think it was some symbolic gesture that kept my folks together?
I do think symbols matter.
Get you started, maybe.
Get you a night, maybe a week.
But things add up over time, and it takes more than symbols to get past it all.
What got my folks through another couple of decades was honesty.
Oh, really?
Honesty about what?
Everything, my man.
Whatever you want to know... just ask.
What happened to Shane?
What's the matter, you don't gamble?
My stomach's bothering me.
Too much rich food.
Too much Pernell.
What's the hottest girl at the party doing hanging out all by herself?
Nursing my wound.
Holy shit.
What happened?
Broke a glass.
Guess who insisted on administering first aid.
Pernell tried to apologize to me.
That's great.
See if you can spin that into something more.
Toby, there's a video.
Of what?
I don't know, but he thinks it's going to get him off.
I'm going to deal with Toby.
No.
Now is not the time to go in hot.
Did it ever occur to you that I just might have a plan?
Why don't I get the driver to take you home?
No.
I'm staying.
He can't hurt me here.
Fuck him.
All right.
See you at home.
Gorgeous.
Hey.
You okay?
Come on.
Let's cut the cake.
Fireworks.
I've never been to a party with fireworks.
There he is.
Thank you, thank you.
You've got great singing voices.
Thank you so much.
Um...
You know what?
All year long, you all have to listen to me make speeches and go off about whatever the hell is so important on that day.
So tonight
I'm going to give you all a present:
no speeches.
You like that.
You like that one, yeah.
No, seriously, thank you all for coming, and, um... here's hoping we can do this again 48 years from now.
Thank you.
Can we get the fire department here?
Because this is-- this is dangerous.
You know what?
I got my team here.
We'll take care of it.
Be careful what you wish for.
Let's bring it in.
Cut the cake!
Enjoy the party.
Enjoy the party.
You know, he doesn't have to come back out.
Nah.
Regis scared him by telling him about the video.
I want to know who he came running to about it.
We have a fucking problem.
Do you know that somewhere in this building there is a shipment of Justin Bieber wigs?
I'm not mocking your being bald.
You're always so fucking amused.
We all make choices.
Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know
I killed that hacker chick?
Well, guess what.
She does.
She didn't know a few days ago.
Well, she sure as shit knows now!
She about jumped out of her skin when she saw me tonight.
And her fucking husband's got some video Caldwell made that's going to blow up his case?
I sincerely doubt that.
You can afford doubt.
I need certainty.
I need you to make sure that she never talks.
Crystal Harris is going to find Bathwater for me.
I could give a flying fuck about Bathwater!
You don't need to give a flying fuck.
...give a flying fuck about passionately is what I want, and what I want is Crystal Harris alive and free until she finishes the job.
I don't want to...
mess up our arrangement, but I can't have Crystal walking around out there.
What could she prove?
What can she prove?
Nothing.
And I wouldn't worry about the video.
Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
I do.
You-
- You motherfucker.
Give it to me.
No.
- Give it to me.
- No.
It's clearly best for both of us if I have some influence over your actions.
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker.
Shit.
Fuck this.
Keith!
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm all right, I think.
Just a nick.
Who did this?
Quick little fucker.
Dark hair, beard.
He told Toby he has the tape.
Heh.
Ohh.
Now that's good.
Ohh.
Please, God.
"You were right."
"The gun is going to protect you."
Evening, Judge Harris.
Manny, um... give me some of your, uh,
Balvenie 40 year, would you?
You know that's $500 a shot.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Better make it a double.
Celebrating?
No, I'm just trying to make the most of my last few days of freedom.
You'll beat it, sir.
Your lips to God's ears, Manny.
You a lefty?
The only people I see using Mont Blanc ballpoints are lefties.
They can't use fountain pens.
Right, because there's too much smear.
Yeah, my son got me this as a gift.
Yeah, he understood because--
You all right?
Pernell?
You okay?
Page 2.
Line 18, section C.
Oh, shit.
Fuck.
No.
I don't want to look at this.
Read it, Crys.
"Based on fingerprints,
"victim-held gun in left hand when firing fatal shot."
They fucked up, Crys.
They saw PJ write his suicide note with his left hand, so they assumed he was left-handed, so that's where they put the gun.
Except PJ did everything else right-handed.
So why would he have a gun in his left hand?
He wouldn't.
Exactly.
Our son didn't shoot himself, Crys.
He was murdered.
Dear Lord... please forgive me.
I was a fool.
I thought You'd betrayed me, and all I could hear was my own anger.
But now I know.
You have chosen me.
You have a purpose for me.
You said to Jeremiah, "Call to Me,
"and I will answer you,
"and I will tell you great and mighty things which you do not know."
Well, here I am, God... calling to You.
I am Your servant.
Reveal my path to me, and I shall do everything You demand.
Your will be done.

♫ I'm a man ♫
♫ These streets ♫
♫ Got me wandering ♫

♫ I should've prayed ♫
♫ The night before ♫
♫ Now I'm losing ♫
♫ Everything I have ♫
♫ Yesterday it felt so good ♫
♫ But now today ♫
♫ It feels so bad ♫
♫♫
♫ I'm slowing' down the tune ♫
♫ I never liked it fast ♫
♫ You want to get there soon ♫
♫ I want to get there last ♫
♫ It's not because I'm old ♫
♫ It's not the life I live ♫
♫ I always liked it slow ♫
♫ If that's what my mama says ♫
♫ I always liked it slow ♫
♫ I never liked it fast ♫

Water's perfect.
You coming?
I haven't been in the pool in five years.
Oh, that's a fucking shame.
People lucky enough to have a pool should pay a fine if they don't use it once a month.
Open it to the public.
Even better.
You reading the obituaries?
I'm trying to see if there's going to be a funeral for her, but I can't find it.
The Natasha girl?
Yeah.
I should be there.
Oh.
Okay.
Whatever gets your ass out of the house.
- Don't.
- Uch, Crys, this is just-- this is so stupid.
I get that you're spooked.
So am I.
But you don't know that that cop shot her.
I heard his voice.
Then you call the FBI.
You call the fucking DEA.
Anybody with badges and guns.
And say what?
So you do nothing?
Forever?
I love you, honey, and boy, do I love hanging out by your fucking pool.
But I can't be your babysitter for the rest of your life.
I told you when I got here that I could only stay till today.
Wait, wait.
Just one more day, please.
Why?
If you're not going to do anything, how will tomorrow be any different than today?
If you don't trust the cops, you should at least call Pernell.
I got a letter from our landlord today.
60 day notice.
Guess what.
They can kiss my ass.
This is our home.
This is the home of truth.
You know, that's why they don't want us here.
They don't want us to tell the truth.
But because you do-- You want the truth.
- Paul--
- You need to know--
Alicia, I-
- I just wrinkled up the letter.
I have one chance to do it fresh.
Okay.
You need to see this.
You need to see this.
[sigh]
I already called the cops.
Thanks.
Just ask him to leave.
If he refuses, don't push it.
Just wait for the cops.
[whispering]
Actually, Holly, I'll talk to him.
There he is, the skeptic.
You still mad at God?
Here I am.
Take it out on me.
I don't want to fight.
Why are you in our chapel?
We worship God here.
We've been found.
So have I.
I believe.
We don't want you here.
Why not?
Aren't all believers welcome?
You don't believe.
Yes, I do.
I'm anointed.
No.
You need help.
This is why I'm here.
God is sending me messages through this pen.
I would like for you to help me understand it.
All right, you might think you're anointed.
You're not going to get my help again.
I am telling you that everything you told me was right.
- I see that now.
- You hurt people.
Bad people who I never would have found without God's guidance and your help.
A few days ago, you wanted to kill me because you didn't think there was a God.
And now you're back to thinking you're anointed?
When did that change?
When I realized that God kept His promise.
You remember Tessie?
Yeah, your call girl.
My wife.
She's pregnant.
It's a boy.
My boy.
Your hooker wife is pregnant, and you think that makes you anointed?
God didn't give PJ back to me, but he did give me a son.
He answered me.
Just...not in the way that I expected.
I'm glad you believe again.
I truly hope you can walk your path with Jesus by your side, but this is not the church for you.
Who's the nonbeliever now?
You okay, Judge Harris?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know what it's like...
I saw this video one time where this deaf kid got an operation so he could hear for the first time.
These cochlear implants they got.
Anyway, after the operation, they set him down at this table, and, uh, and they tapped one, but they haven't turned the thing on yet, so he doesn't hear anything.
And then they turn on the device, and they tap... and the kid... [sniffle] he starts bawling.
That's all it took-- a little tap.
That's how I feel, Keith.
Like I've been going through life with no sound, and now everything I hear is a miracle.
That's how it is for me, too, Judge Harris.
When I first met you in that courtroom, it was like somebody tapped on the table.
You've been right all along.
I'm so sorry I made you wait.
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with patience.
Well... the waiting's over.
We're going to put an end to this fucking trial.
Shane Caldwell's wife said that there's a video that I would pay good money for.
Does she have it?
I don't think so, but she definitely knows what's on it.
I want to start there.
Bring her to me.
Yes, sir.
She's not going to come by choice.
Not the same old steakhouse here, right?
Every once in a while, you got to change up the rhythm.
Half the kitchen staff here is from El Salvador.
This is what they cook for themselves.
I thought so.
There's pepperoni in this papusa.
[laughing] Yeah, these guys pick up some new flavors from el norte.
You want to get some slaw on that.
It's good stuff.
You ever been to El Salvador?
Beautiful.
You should take your lady there some time.
Or your man or whatever.
Just go for yourself.
What the hell.
Went down there for my third honeymoon.
If I'm smart, it's my last.
You ever been married?
No.
Yeah.
Mach dot This, eHookUp, whatever.
Everyone keeps asking like it's so hard to get into a relationship.
It ain't half as hard as getting out of one.
You know what I mean?
I was wondering when we'd get around to having this conversation.
- Two more beers.
- At once.
Go ahead.
Okay.
San Vicente politics have run on Harris family money for forever.
It's a bad relationship, which gives you a real opportunity here-- a chance to turn being the biggest employer in San Vicente to being a political force.
But there are going to be some people you need to have on your side.
People you could persuade?
A lot of them are more loyal to the Harris family money than they are to Pernell.
You know anything about Africanized honeybees?
Word is they have extra-big stingers.
That's probably a myth.
[chuckling]
What they have is a uniquely political behavior, even for social insects.
When they find another hive, they send a few workers over.
They cling to the hive, make themselves known to the local bees, communicate, share food.
So when an African queen shows up to take over, they welcome her as one of their own.
Here we are.
I paid for two clinics, a park, a quarter of the REAL Initiative so far.
Yes, you have.
Senior elections are coming up, and there's going to be campaigns to fund.
You get the right friends in line, it's going to take bigger moves and deeper pockets.
What if I fully funded the REAL Initiative myself?
No Harris money.
No fundraisers, that sort of move?
Well, yeah.
That would make an impression.
You understand that once the process of taking over a hive begins, it can become chaotic.
There can be no order until the new power structure's in place.
Like humans, like bees, right?
Not really.
Humans sometimes tolerate multiple loyalties, but a hive can only have one queen.
Then I say viva la fucking bees.
[chatter]
Here we are, sir.
Wine list and menu.
Both Boss Hogs.
Thanks.
[chatter] [laughter]
- It's proper.
- No.
Kaplan couldn't fucking believe it, but the judge sustained it.
He says if the dog is in the will, it has standing to contest.
[laughing]
His face goes all red!
Hey, uh, let's get out of here, okay?
Ahem.
Caldwell's wife is gone.
Gone shopping or gone gone?
Clothes missing, the flowers are dead, and the milk's gone sour.
Seems like she left in a hurry.
Maybe somebody made her leave.
Didn't want her talking to me.
I took some mail and stuff.
Should help us track her down.
If she's traveling with a kid, it's going to make it easier.
She's got a sister in Ukiah.
Well, that day may come, but it's not today.
God gave me the meaning of another one of my visions.
What was it?
You know Proverbs 25:19?
Yeah.
Something about teeth?
That's the one.
I can call another vote for the Harris High name change, but it won't matter.
It's still going to be 4-3 in Pernell Harris' favor.
Why poke the bear?
Do you hear yourself?
You're basically saying that you're more afraid of Pernell Harris than of Robert Boston, and that's okay.
I don't want you to be scared of me.
I want you to believe in me.
I'm at the top of my game, and next year I'll be re-elected in a cakewalk, and he will be on trial for murder.
See what I mean?
You know I love you, Robert, but my position is not appointed.
I have to run, just like you, and the Harris family is my biggest donor, by far, every election.
You don't need them anymore, Gloria.
You got name recognition now.
- How do you think I got that?
- Gloria, stop.
I need you to trust me.
Put the vote back on the agenda for next week.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor.
Looks like Pernell RSVP'd to your party.
- You're kidding me.
- Plus one, which I have no idea who that could be because Crystal already RSVP'd last week solo.
He's not coming to my party.
So you invite your three ex-wives but not your bestie?
Yes.
Once he becomes my ex-friend long enough, then he'll get invited again.
But not this year.
Okay.
I'll send an email.
No.
No.
You deliver that message in person.
Me?
Yes.
You should be afraid of me.
- Um...
- I'll do it, Pops.
I'll have Cam drive me.
Crys?
Honey--
I got to go.
I want to get home before dark.
- This doesn't make sense.
- What?
The ME's report.
It's just-
- It's bullshit.
What's wrong with it?
It says that she was shot during a drug deal.
They found a pipe in a bag and empty meth phials everywhere.
Well, maybe she was a part-time user.
She wasn't a tweaker.
She was a hacker.
She was a brilliant one.
PJ got high, didn't he?
You do.
I was on the phone with her.
She was not buying drugs.
Guy next door was.
Wrong place wrong time.
That is not what happened!
This is just-- It's a cover-up.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm trying to make this right.
Are you?
Or are you trying to make yourself feel better because you fucked up?
You didn't kill her.
She'd be alive today if I didn't talk her into going.
Crys, you can't control everything!
And I know that's what you like to do.
You've always done that, and it's gotten you really far from where you started.
But you are drinking your own Kool-Aid if you think you've ever been in charge.
Shit happens.
Life is gonna fuck you.
You have nothing to do with it.
She didn't deserve to die like that.
She was a--
She was a fucking kid.
Just like PJ, huh?
Is that what this is?
Bright kids are going to go where they go.
They're going to do what they do.
They're going to love who they love, and... we don't get to choose.
I'll call you when I get home.
Uh--
Uhh.
- [knocking]
- Come in.
Hey.
Asa.
How you doing, Pernell?
Great.
My dad is not coming.
Oh.
Oh.
Have a seat.
Nah.
This isn't gonna take long.
He doesn't want you at his party.
If you show up, they'll stop you at the door.
They'll s--
I haven't missed one of your father's birthday parties in 20-something years.
Might be time to start a new tradition, right?
I know I fucked up, but, I mean, how am I going to make it right if I can't talk to him?
Every time you do talk to him, you make something else wrong.
Listen, Pernell, it's just not a good time.
He wants to regain some control over his life, make his own decisions.
If they can't track us, they can't control us, you know?
What do you mean by that?
PJ said that in a video.
You heard it before, right?
Maybe.
I don't remember.
What's that have to do with your old man's birthday party?
Nothing.
I just figured you'd heard it.
Look, just steer clear tomorrow night, all right?
There's been enough static.
There's things he needs to know, Asa.
So tell me.
I'll tell him.
Nah.
This is just for him.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you post it?
Not yet.
I don't know if I want to.
Why not?
I mean, that guy who beat your ass a week ago was here begging for forgiveness.
I'd think our followers would eat that up.
What if he's right?
About what?
Being chosen.
He's crazy.
Don't let him suck you in.
Whatever money he might give us, it's not worth the trouble.
I'm not thinking about the money.
Paul, he's a murderer.
Why are we even having this conversation?
Why did God choose Saul, a man who killed hundreds of Christians, to become His apostle?
Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene, a whore, to be His travel companion?
- Stop it.
- I'm just saying that God's ways are mysterious-- sometimes.
But Pernell's aren't.
I don't care if he starts walking on water.
I don't want him here.
He's dangerous.
[keys jingling] [door opens]
Sorry I called you so late.
What's going on, Crys?
If I let you come back, you okay with the guest room?
I fucking love the guest room.
A knife?
Why do you have that?
Crystal.
What the fuck's going on?
Wilson's dead.
What?
She went to that meeting.
He shot her.
Who shot her?
Chief Clay.
Toby?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.
Come here.
Oh.
[sobbing]
Were you there?
Mm-mm.
So how do you know it was Toby?
I heard his voice.
I was on the phone with her.
I heard everything.
Now I feel like he's always right outside the door... and he's waiting for me, and I don't know what to do.
First thing you're gonna do is get some sleep.
There's nobody outside that door.
Nobody's going to hurt you, not while I'm here.
We're going to figure all this shit out in the morning.
Thank you.
Oh.
You got a little more junk in your trunk these days.
Been a busy month.
Here.
This one.
Hmm.
Are you sure about that?
I don't give a fuck, Fortune.
They all look good.
Oh.
Okay.
Make my job a little easier.
Now, maybe next time,
I'll just have a suit off the rack from Macy's.
Hey, look, I didn't mean it like that.
- Uh-huh.
- You know.
Come on.
What do you think?
Nice.
Want to talk to me about the Valco tract?
No.
Want me to talk to you about the Valco tract?
We're done here, Fortune.
I just need my box.
Bobo, you're playing games with yourself.
You told me that the Shane Caldwell connection meant nothing.
That Valco order was going to be signed, no matter what.
It won't look that way.
Do you honestly think that I'm the only person that knows how to connect the dots?
There aren't any dots to connect.
Really?
There's no dots?
Well, let me tell you what I found in two days.
Shane Caldwell-- dot.
Eminent domain order for the Valco tract-- dot.
Holding companies that own land around the Brooks development-- dot, two of which I've already been able to connect to the Harris Family Trust-- dot dot.
And the value of the land has tripled since construction started- dot-dot-dot.
- Dot-dot-dot-goose.
I get it.
You're so good at what you do.
Now I understand why you didn't want to testify.
I didn't do anything illegal.
Mm.
Don't aim too high now.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You think I'm any different than any other politician?
I used to.
Izzy, you been around long enough.
You know what it is.
I don't make the rules.
The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
And it was hanging on by a thread.
So I had to make Pernell happy to get the deal done.
- That's it.
- But blaming Pernell is not going to make you look any better, Bobo.
Of course not.
But it is his fault, the reason why I'm in this position.
That you're looking at me with disappointment in your eyes.
I--
I got Brooks Innovation setting up shop in my city.
I'm launching a $40 million education initiative.
I've got 500 people coming to my birthday party thinking I'm the toast of the town.
But the truth of the matter is what?
I'm one trial away from my whole legacy going up in smoke.
And that's his fault.
That's his fault.
See what I mean?
Crys, you do realize that Toby doesn't know that you know he killed Wilson, right?
You don't know what he knows.
I know he knows where you live.
And I know he has dozens of plausible reasons for his guys to storm in here and start shooting and you end up accidentally dead.
But that hasn't happened, and he's had days.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
So what is it?
[sigh]
I called her this morning.
Wilson's-- Natasha's mother.
Aw, shit.
I told her what happened to Natasha wasn't her fault.
No, it wasn't.
And I told her that... the bag was mine and I made her score drugs for me.
Jesus.
Why would you do that, Crys?
Because maybe I can't control everything.
But Toby Clay put a bullet in her little girl's throat, and that woman deserves somebody to hate.
Maybe hate's not the right answer.
Sometimes it's all a mother has left.
Dear Lord, please lead him to speak with truth and enlightenment so that we may find the next step in our path.
- Amen.
- Amen.
So this neurologist that I was seeing... he said that the brain, under stress--
Mm.
...can have these episodes.
It may seem like hallucinations, but, um, it's really the brain in overdrive making these connections that you would never see otherwise.
You think that's possible?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, it's plausible, right?
So this thing that's been bugging me,
I kept having these visions of your teeth falling out, and I couldn't figure it out.
And then I saw you yesterday, and it hit me.
You know your Bible, Adam?
- Proverbs 25:19?
- Mm-mm.
Relying on a treacherous man in time of trouble is like chewing with a broken tooth.
A treacherous man.
That's you, Adam.
Mm-mm.
Mm.
Lose the gag.
- [coughing]
- You can talk now if you want.
It's what you're good at, isn't it?
You're out of your mind if you think you can get away with this.
Chances are I'm getting a lethal injection, so you don't think I give a fuck what I can get away with, do you?
You, on the other hand, should be very concerned because you're on trial, too, and I'm the judge, so bang-bang-bang, court's in session.
First and only witness, Mr. Adam Regis.
Help!
[muffled shouts]
Nope.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Careful, Adam.
My bailiff is very enthusiastic.
[gasping, coughing]
How did they get you to sell me out?
Did they pay you?
Or was it as easy as just asking?
I-
- I didn't do anything.
Aah!
Aah!
[sobbing]
Perjury is a very serious offense in this courtroom, Mr. Regis.
Please.
I didn't.
[screaming]
Adam, Adam.
When I went to see that doctor in San Francisco, they got a photo of me on the Bay Bridge.
They knew exactly where I was going to be, when I was going to be there, and only one other motherfucker on this planet knew that information, so please cut the shit.
[whimpering]
Or maybe we could put your mother on the stand.
I mean, Keith can find her anywhere any time.
No, I didn't...
So who did you report to?
Was it McCauley?
Toby?
Or both?
Huh?
Toby!
To-Toby!
Just Toby!
[sobbing]
Good.
Now, you see how easy that was?
Huh?
Oh, by the way, you're still fucking guilty.
Please.
- So--
- Please.
...let's talk about restitution.
W-What do you mean?
Well, there's a reason why my friend left your pretty face untouched.
Something you're going to do for me, Adam.
Or we could go the other way.
What other way?
No.
No, please.
Please.
Death... or restitution.
Here we go.
No more bets.
♫ Hey, well, that's exactly what a nigga came for ♫ [cheering]
Thanks for your vote.
Glad you could make it.
I appreciate it.
Come on, everybody.
Have a good time.
The drinks are free.
Ooh.
Sorry.
Yeah.
This way.
Smile.
Oh, shit.
Look, honey.
Look at me.
You're safe.
I promise.
Just smile.
You'll be fine.
Hey!
Good evening, Mrs. Harris, judge.
Can you hold on a moment?
Hey, Asa.
Boy, you're looking good tonight.
Pernell, what are you doing here?
This is not part of our agreement.
I'm not taking my wife through the kitchen, Ace.
Fine.
Fuck.
Whatever.
Let's go.
[sigh]
I'll go get myself a drink.
Or three.
Asa:
Come on, Pernell.
- You having a good time?
- Mm-hmm.
Go get whatever you want.
Ah, if she'd have known
I'd be balling like this one day, she'd have had a little more patience with me.
How long since you're divorced?
Uh, 11 years now.
And you're still concerned with what she thinks?
Well, that's not why I invited her.
This is to remind her she fucked up.
Ha ha.
Hey, Mr. Brooks, sorry.
I need him a minute.
Uh, okay.
What's up?
He came.
- Who?
- Pernell.
Come on, Ace.
Pops, you would really rather spend your birthday with Nathan Brooks?
That's supposed to be my choice.
Look, you know how sentimental he can be.
Just give him a few minutes.
Maybe he'll go home.
[scoff]
Well, shit.
I knew it.
Where is he?
I put him in the pool room.
It's the billiard room, not the pool room.
So do you play billiards in there, or do you shoot pool?
You know what?
I need another drink for this one.
Go tell him I'll be there in ten minutes.
All right.
Mrs. Harris.
Mm-- [gasp]
Jesus.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
No, no, you're not.
You're bleeding.
Can I get a first aid kit here, please?
I should just go to the bathroom.
There's a shard in there.
You don't need any stitches, but you're bleeding a lot.
It's because your heart is racing.
Try taking some deep breaths.
Not so good with blood?
I think I should go to the ER.
Shh.
Hold on.
There.
You got blood on your hand.
Here we are, Mrs. Harris.
I'll take care of this in no time.
I don't suppose you want to shoot a rack.
If anything gets shot in here, it's going to be you.
You were asked not to come.
[balls clink]
Got you a present.
What is it, a horse's head?
I mean, it's your birthday, motherfucker.
Can you please just lighten up?
My son said you wanted to talk.
We've been talking.
You done yet?
Remember that time...
Ida stepped out on Papa Gene?
Look, if you came here to talk shit about my mother,
I will put my foot up your ass.
What was the name of that motherfucker she went out with?
Weird little dude.
He's got a beard under here, some shit.
Marion Townsend.
Marion Townsend.
Yeah.
I never did understand what she saw in him.
It was the Mercedes that caught her eye.
A janitor's wife don't get that kind of ride at home.
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car.
He brought it home.
He put it back on his Caprice.
What did he call it?
The, uh...
The Merchevy.
The Merchevy, yeah.
[laughing]
Yeah.
Yeah.
He kept swapping that thing from car to car until my mother passed.
She never stepped out on him again, though.
I mean, you know, things went south for a little while, but they made it right.
You know.
She stuck with him... till she died.
I'm tired of you and me playing games, Pernell.
Let me ask you a question.
You really think it was some symbolic gesture that kept my folks together?
I do think symbols matter.
Get you started, maybe.
Get you a night, maybe a week.
But things add up over time, and it takes more than symbols to get past it all.
What got my folks through another couple of decades was honesty.
Oh, really?
Honesty about what?
Everything, my man.
Whatever you want to know... just ask.
What happened to Shane?
What's the matter, you don't gamble?
My stomach's bothering me.
Too much rich food.
Too much Pernell.
What's the hottest girl at the party doing hanging out all by herself?
Nursing my wound.
Holy shit.
What happened?
Broke a glass.
Guess who insisted on administering first aid.
Pernell tried to apologize to me.
That's great.
See if you can spin that into something more.
Toby, there's a video.
Of what?
I don't know, but he thinks it's going to get him off.
I'm going to deal with Toby.
No.
Now is not the time to go in hot.
Did it ever occur to you that I just might have a plan?
Why don't I get the driver to take you home?
No.
I'm staying.
He can't hurt me here.
Fuck him.
All right.
See you at home.
Gorgeous.
Hey.
You okay?

And her fucking husband's got some video Caldwell made that's going to blow up his case?
I sincerely doubt that.
You can afford doubt.
I need certainty.
I need you to make sure that she never talks.
Crystal Harris is going to find Bathwater for me.
I could give a flying fuck about Bathwater!
You don't need to give a flying fuck.
...give a flying fuck about passionately is what I want, and what I want is Crystal Harris alive and free until she finishes the job.
I don't want to...
mess up our arrangement, but I can't have Crystal walking around out there.
What could she prove?
What can she prove?
Nothing.
And I wouldn't worry about the video.
Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
I do.

Read it, Crys.
"Based on fingerprints,
"victim-held gun in left hand when firing fatal shot."
They fucked up, Crys.
They saw PJ write his suicide note with his left hand, so they assumed he was left-handed, so that's where they put the gun.
Except PJ did everything else right-handed.
So why would he have a gun in his left hand?
He wouldn't.
Exactly.

- I didn't go because
I'm actually not an intern anymore.
Oh, they let you go?
Gosh, it's the nature of the biz, I guess.
One day you're up, and the next you're sitting on a blow-up pillow because your perineum's dented like a can at the supermarket.
No, I got promoted.
I'm a PA now.
Oh, really?
Congratulations on all your success.
Okay, get this: that fink Aidan got promoted.
- Wait, who?
- Aidan, the intern from downstairs who started after me.
Ugh, what is this feeling I have?
I'm sad, I'm angry, I want to... [demon voice] Destroy him.
It's okay, you're experiencing professional jealousy, like how I used to get so mad about Cheryl from my college because she thinks she's so great because she wrote one book about college.
[crumples]
I wanna move up in this business.
Why does Aidan get to skip the line?
Why, because he asked for extra assignments?
Because he doesn't take a nap every day in the tape room?
I'm gonna take a nap in the tape room.
No, Mom, he's not skipping the line, he's hustling, like me.
Why do you think
- I didn't go home last night?
- Because you live in a 16th floor walk-up in the Werewolf District?
No, because I was working on the story of a lifetime.
Guess how many celebrities got hacked this month.
- 83?
- 29, why did you guess such a high number?
Anyway, I did some digging.
It's 1:00 a.m., I'm staring at Kate Upton's natural larges,

- Okay, okay, I saw this coming.
I love you no matter what, just promise me that you will wear the dress at the wedding and she'll wear the tux
- with the sneakers.
- No, Mom, that the hacks could be connected to something bigger.
I found these message boards that the hackers use to talk to each other, and I found a source who is willing to talk, and that's not an assignment,
- Mom, that is me, hustling.
- Okay, I get it.
Well, maybe I could be a hustler like you.

Sorry I'm late, everyone.
I just came from a three-hour management seminar entitled
"How to Keep Your Morning Meetings Focused and On Task."
So I have something I wanna say.
As you know, I love being an intern, but I don't want to be an intern forever.
As Jay-Z once said, "I'm a hustler, baby.
Noodles ask about me." He doesn't really say "noodles"
- in the song.
He says...
- Okay, Mom, maybe if you would
- just get to the point?
- I want to pitch a story
- for tonight's show.
- Carol, I admire your pluck, but let's leave the pitching to the professionals.
- Gene, what have you got?
- How about an investigative piece where we follow the cantor from my synagogue who's always texting my wife?
Okay, Carol, what do you have?
Oh, so the story is Biscuit Blitz.
It's a phone game that all of my friends and I play, and the scoop is, it's fun!
Congratulations, Carol.
Took a lot of guts to say something that stupid in front of a room full of people.
You should be proud.
Well, I don't think it's stupid.
Biscuit Blitz is everywhere
- right now, actually...
- Oh, it's everywhere, huh?
That's funny, I don't remember hearing about it this morning
- from my shoeshine man.
- Well, I think
- we should do the story.
- Fine, Katie, you can produce Portia's... and I guess Carol's...
Biscuit Blitz piece.
- [gasps]
- I actually have a hacking
- story that I would really...
- Look, Portia, I understand why you think some little game is newsworthy, since your last job was at E!
co-hosting "Fashion 911"...
Um, it was "Fashion 9-11,"
and it was immediately canceled.
But journalists can't just report on what they like.
What, should I interview my bird on the show?
Wait, should I interview my bird on the show?
Can you stop mansplaining my job to me and interrupting me
- every single time I...
- Shh, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, you have to listen to someone who knows better.
Well, I'm just happy that my story's on the show tonight.
Great meeting, gang.
Let's get to work.
We haven't done anything yet, Carol!
We just watched two people fight!
Greg?
Greg, I don't wanna do that Biscuit Blitz piece, but it's for a really good reason.
I think I'm about to crack the biggest story of my career.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, let's hear it.
- Yeah, you better roll up those sleeves 'cause this is some "Spotlight" shizz.
Okay, so I think the recent celebrity hacks are part of a bigger story, and I found a source who I'm hoping will be willing to spill the electronic beans, or, as the hackers might call them, e-beans.
- And who is this source?
- I can't tell you, or know that, but his handle is Doctor Skullcrusher, except the Ls are 1s.
Isn't that so computer-y?
Wait, wait, wait, put the sleeves back up.
So what you're saying is, you have nothing.
Well, Greg, you're not giving me a ch...
Look, I get it.
We all dream about bagging the big story, but our job isn't tracking down clues or meeting mysterious sources.
It's saying stuff on TV that people already read on the Internet.
Okay, but, Greg, aren't you afraid that you're gonna miss out?
This could be huge.
No, I'm scared that you're gonna chase an anonymous source and wind up making a fool out of yourself.
Wait, why would I make a fool out of myself?
Do you not trust my instincts?
I mean, come on, you remember what happened when you tried to break a story on the fashion industry?
My source turned out to be an ad bot for Ann Taylor Loft, and I fell in love with him, but that wasn't my fault,
- he kept calling me.
- Exactly.
- Do not waste your time on this.
- But, Greg, I...
- I said no.

- I'm gonna be giving the speech when we win the Daytime Emmy.
I have a lot of people

I picked the font that Katie didn't use.
- [phone buzzes] - "I can meet to talk between 4:00 and 4:30.
It's now or never."
Who are you texting?
Are you still dating
- that undertaker?
- No, Portia, I said I wish
I was dating The Undertaker, from wrestling.
No, I have a source, and he wants to talk.
Oh, are you gonna meet him?
Greg won't let me.
He says I have bad instincts.
Oh, he won't let you?
Katie, it's sometime between 2010 and 2020.

But I can't leave now.

Well, the piece is basically done, and if Greg asks,
I'll just say that you flushed your leg down the toilet again.
Okay, thanks, Portia.
Okay...

- You had bad instincts.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
[all murmuring]
Okay, so now we're doing the murmur at the end.
Hey, Chuck.
Can I help you with something?
Actually, I do need something.
Can you get me my eye drops?
They're in the trunk of my car next to what may seem like makeup for men.
It's actually makeup
- for women, that I use.
- Ah, you have dry eye from playing Biscuit Blitz all night.
I didn't play all night.
I took a long break to pee into that jar.
You're only on level three?
Ah, I know the problem.
You're not using Biscuit Bombs.
I don't need to.
I know what I'm doing.
Shh, honey, honey, honey, you need to listen to someone who knows better.
Why is this know-it-all tone going into my ears instead of coming out of my mouth?
I don't need you momsplaining to me something I already know.
Oh, crap.
I just learned a lesson.
About the way you spoke to Portia yesterday?
Yes, I was so condescending.
And if journalism is half as important to her as Blitzing is to me, then, wow, just wow.
Carol, thank you.
Don't forget my jar.
No, no, no, wait, ah, I'm crocheting you an apology, and it's not done yet.
It's supposed to be a blanket that says, "I'm sorry, Greg."
- I am sorry.
- It's fine.
No, for real.
I...
I meant to only privately humiliate you, and then, you know, maybe show our coworkers later.
- Behind your back.
- Unfortunately for you, you're not the only good reporter around here.
Wait, I'm a good reporter?
I've done a little investigating of my own.
About you.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
In high school, you attended Court Jester Camp
- at Medieval Times.
- Gah.
And who could forget the scathing op-ed you wrote for your college paper about how there should be more cake options in the dining halls?
"Chocolate and Vanilla Leave Students Wanting More."
And I dearly love your "World of Warcraft" character,
- L'Erotica the News Elf.
- Okay, she was the best reporter in the realm, but, wait, go back to the part
- about me being a good reporter.
- I'm sorry
I doubted your instincts.
Maybe that source
- of yours was legit.
- No, he definitely was not.
He keeps texting me asking if I wanna do a stripper dance
- at his friend's bar mitzvah.
- I also did a little digging on him.
His father works for
- a cyber security firm.
- Wait, you think that kid
- might know something?
- Uh, you think?
Sorry, I guess I was still a little mad.
Thought you were coming alone.
Who's your friend?
Would you two be willing to lez out at Mark's bar mitzvah?
Okay, listen, you little punk.
If you don't tell me everything you know, I will make your life a Dust Bowl.
I don't know what that means.
I never did my report.
You better listen to what she says, all right?
You do not want to see her angry.
Do you think this is some kind of joke?
That famous butts and wangs are just out there
- for the world to see?
- It's not just celebrities.
It's a huge data breach.
They think
- it's an app or something.
- What's the app?
I've got your teacher tied up in a warehouse, soaked in kerosene.
Katie, just dial it back a tad.
I don't know!
Why are you doing this?
It's my birthday.
It's your birthday?
I'm so sorry, but I made you a blanket that will say,
- "Happy birthday, Source."
- Why are you here again?
- Get out of our lives!
- Should we run?
Mm-hmm.
Portia, I'm not good at apologizing.
Uh, was that it?
Well, let me try this again in language you understand.
Urban Dictionary defines
"apologizing" as a sex act where the man stands
- in the tank of a toilet...
- Okay, fine, fine,
I accept your apology, as long as you can admit that there are some things I know better than you.
Yes, Portia, of course.
I promise.
And from now on, I will listen and not always assume I know best.
Maybe I am good at apologizing.
Hey, Chuck, I think you just got hacked.
The "New York Post" published your fiber journals.
What?
Oh, God.
I hope they don't find my drunk voice mails to Nancy Pelosi.
I can explain the nickname "Captain Orgasm."
- It's worse than it sounds.
- You know, just a piece
- of advice, when I was hacked...
- I'm not listening to you.
I know about this.
I know about everything.
[Portia sighs]
Aidan's gonna have a field day with this.
Oh, I download one app on my boss's phone and look what happens.
- Wait, one app?
- Yeah, Biscuit Blitz.
Maybe that's what that kid was talking about.
Biscuit Blitz is the data breach.
It's on everyone's phone, it has access to
- 100 million users worldwide.
- Oh, my God.
- Do you know what this means?
- You may have just cracked
- the story of a lifetime.
- No, it means I pitched the story of a lifetime.
Oh, you take that, Aidan.
I'm gonna rub his face in it.
That twerp.
[laughs]
Wait, wait, I found something.
It's the other boot.
Well, my career in England's over.
Maybe I could move to America, become a better version of myself, like Stefan Ur'kel.
Thanks for nothing, Nessie.
[splashing] [ominous music]
Hey, Aidan, didn't see you at the intern softball game this weekend.
I got a home run.
But don't ask anybody about it, because they'll lie and say I sat on a ball and had to
- go to the hospital.
- I didn't go because
I'm actually not an intern anymore.
Oh, they let you go?
Gosh, it's the nature of the biz, I guess.
One day you're up, and the next you're sitting on a blow-up pillow because your perineum's dented like a can at the supermarket.
No, I got promoted.
I'm a PA now.
Oh, really?
Congratulations on all your success.
Okay, get this: that fink Aidan got promoted.
- Wait, who?
- Aidan, the intern from downstairs who started after me.
Ugh, what is this feeling I have?
I'm sad, I'm angry, I want to...
Destroy him.
It's okay, you're experiencing professional jealousy, like how I used to get so mad about Cheryl from my college because she thinks she's so great because she wrote one book about college.
I wanna move up in this business.
Why does Aidan get to skip the line?
Why, because he asked for extra assignments?
Because he doesn't take a nap every day in the tape room?
I'm gonna take a nap in the tape room.
No, Mom, he's not skipping the line, he's hustling, like me.
Why do you think
- I didn't go home last night?
- Because you live in a 16th floor walk-up in the Werewolf District?
No, because I was working on the story of a lifetime.
Guess how many celebrities got hacked this month.
- 83?
- 29, why did you guess such a high number?
Anyway, I did some digging.
It's 1:00 a.m., I'm staring at Kate Upton's natural larges,
- and you know what I realize?
- Okay, okay, I saw this coming.
I love you no matter what, just promise me that you will wear the dress at the wedding and she'll wear the tux
- with the sneakers.
- No, Mom, that the hacks could be connected to something bigger.
I found these message boards that the hackers use to talk to each other, and I found a source who is willing to talk, and that's not an assignment,
- Mom, that is me, hustling.
- Okay, I get it.
Well, maybe I could be a hustler like you.
Mom, be serious.
No, I'm just kidding.
I understood this conversation.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.
I just came from a three-hour management seminar entitled
"How to Keep Your Morning Meetings Focused and On Task."
So I have something I wanna say.
As you know, I love being an intern, but I don't want to be an intern forever.
As Jay-Z once said, "I'm a hustler, baby.
Noodles ask about me." He doesn't really say "noodles"
- in the song.
He says...
- Okay, Mom, maybe if you would
- just get to the point?
- I want to pitch a story
- for tonight's show.
- Carol, I admire your pluck, but let's leave the pitching to the professionals.
- Gene, what have you got?
- How about an investigative piece where we follow the cantor from my synagogue who's always texting my wife?
Okay, Carol, what do you have?
Oh, so the story is Biscuit Blitz.
It's a phone game that all of my friends and I play, and the scoop is, it's fun!
Congratulations, Carol.
Took a lot of guts to say something that stupid in front of a room full of people.
You should be proud.
Well, I don't think it's stupid.
Biscuit Blitz is everywhere
- right now, actually...
- Oh, it's everywhere, huh?
That's funny, I don't remember hearing about it this morning
- from my shoeshine man.
- Well, I think
- we should do the story.
- Fine, Katie, you can produce Portia's... and I guess Carol's...
Biscuit Blitz piece.
I actually have a hacking
- story that I would really...
- Look, Portia, I understand why you think some little game is newsworthy, since your last job was at E!
co-hosting "Fashion 911"...
Um, it was "Fashion 9-11,"
and it was immediately canceled.
But journalists can't just report on what they like.
What, should I interview my bird on the show?
Wait, should I interview my bird on the show?
Can you stop mansplaining my job to me and interrupting me
- every single time I...
- Shh, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, you have to listen to someone who knows better.
Well, I'm just happy that my story's on the show tonight.
Great meeting, gang.
Let's get to work.
We haven't done anything yet, Carol!
We just watched two people fight!
Greg?
Greg, I don't wanna do that Biscuit Blitz piece, but it's for a really good reason.
I think I'm about to crack the biggest story of my career.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, let's hear it.
- Yeah, you better roll up those sleeves 'cause this is some "Spotlight" shizz.
Okay, so I think the recent celebrity hacks are part of a bigger story, and I found a source who I'm hoping will be willing to spill the electronic beans, or, as the hackers might call them, e-beans.
- And who is this source?
- I can't tell you, or know that, but his handle is Doctor Skullcrusher, except the Ls are 1s.
Isn't that so computer-y?
Wait, wait, wait, put the sleeves back up.
So what you're saying is, you have nothing.
Well, Greg, you're not giving me a ch...
Look, I get it.
We all dream about bagging the big story, but our job isn't tracking down clues or meeting mysterious sources.
It's saying stuff on TV that people already read on the Internet.
Okay, but, Greg, aren't you afraid that you're gonna miss out?
This could be huge.
No, I'm scared that you're gonna chase an anonymous source and wind up making a fool out of yourself.
Wait, why would I make a fool out of myself?
Do you not trust my instincts?
I mean, come on, you remember what happened when you tried to break a story on the fashion industry?
My source turned out to be an ad bot for Ann Taylor Loft, and I fell in love with him, but that wasn't my fault,
- he kept calling me.
- Exactly.
- Do not waste your time on this.
- But, Greg, I...
I said no.
Howard, hey, it's really not a good time.
Hello, Katie Wendelman.
Spring into spring with savings at Ann Taylor Loft.
This is so exciting.
We're producing
- a piece together.
- Sure, Mom, and which part of
- the work are you doing, again?
- I'm gonna be giving the speech when we win the Daytime Emmy.
I have a lot of people
- I need to tell off.
- Okay, here's the script for the Biscuit Blitz piece.
I picked the font that Katie didn't use.
"I can meet to talk between 4:00 and 4:30.
It's now or never."
Who are you texting?
Are you still dating
- that undertaker?
- No, Portia, I said I wish
I was dating The Undertaker, from wrestling.
No, I have a source, and he wants to talk.
Oh, are you gonna meet him?
Greg won't let me.
He says I have bad instincts.
Oh, he won't let you?
Katie, it's sometime between 2010 and 2020.
Women need to stop listening to guys like Chuck and Greg and start listening to their gut.
- My gut says he's wrong.
- My gut says I'm hungry, but my hips say, "Shut up!"
You need to speak to your source, and I need to stand up to Chuck.
But I can't leave now.
I'll miss the show.
Well, the piece is basically done, and if Greg asks,
I'll just say that you flushed your leg down the toilet again.
Okay, thanks, Portia.
Okay...
Ooh, I see a typo.
Oh, good catch.
Why don't you just fix whatever needs fixing?
And then we'll be good to go.
You mean produce the piece?
Yeah, who cares?
Oh, I'm sorry, Chuck.
I didn't mean to take up
- more space than a woman should.
- Oh, well, thank you for apologizing, Portia.
That's very thoughtful of you.
No, Chuck, I'm manspreading to make a point about your mansplaining.
You're not making any sense.
Are you on drugs?
Did you smoke one of those electric marijuana kazoos?
She scratched me!
Just, in light of what happened this morning,
I would love it if this rehearsal didn't devolve into a petty fight, please.
He needs to apologize for talking down to me in front of everyone.
I was trying to save you from doing a stupid story.
It was an act of chivalry.
It's like when you lend a woman your coat because she's cold or you go watch the game when she's having a baby.
Just because you don't know what Biscuit Blitz is doesn't mean it isn't news.
It's the most downloaded app for 18 to 35-year-olds with 100 million users and annual profits exceeding the GDP of the Maldives, but you wouldn't know that because your demographic is mummies, who rose from the dead and found a suit.
Uh...
Excuse me.
I have to get this.
It's my doctor.
Hello?
Oh, so I have tested positive for diarrhea then.
I have to leave the room?
Oh, no, I'm in a conversation that I love and I know what I'm gonna say next in.
Oh, well, you're the doctor.
Bye.
I don't know if you heard any of that, Portia, but I...
Get out.
Oh, God, I hope he's not a murderer.
I really don't want my age in the newspaper.
Oh, hi, is your father, the source, home?
No, baby, it's me.
I'm Doctor Skullcrusher.
Oh, my God, but you're...
You're a kid.
The Ls were 1s because you're... 11, playa.
Here's how it's gonna go down:
I got info that you want, but I'm gonna need three things.
One, you take me to see the new "Beauty and the Beast."
Emma Watson has natural larges.
- Uh.
- Two, you write a five-page report on the Dust Bowl for Miss Regina's class.
Three, we touch tongues, and you post it on your Instagram.
Okay, I'm obviously not gonna do any of that stuff because you are a tiny liar, and I already saw
- "Beauty and the Beast."
- How was it?
It was pretty scary.
Excuse me, who are you?
- Why are you talking to my son?
- Hi, yeah, I can explain.
I met your son in an online chat room.
Okay, I'm in a run.
- Carol, get in here.
- Oh, sorry, Chuck.
Oh, I've been busy producing a news piece.
Unrelated, do you know how to produce a news piece?
Look, I need you to fill me in on Biscuit Blitz.
Really?
This morning, you said Biscuit Blitz was stupid.
Well, I'm a newsman.
I have natural curiosity.
Also an extreme desire to make Portia eat her words like a big, fat peanut butter sandwich.
There's nothing much to know, Chuck.
All you do is download it and play.
Uh, well, why don't you download it for me?
My assistant used to be the tech-savvy one, but she turned 90 and died of natural causes.
Hold on.
You don't have one app?
Not even "Calkalator"?
No, when I first opened the map, a little blue dot followed me everywhere I went.
I said, "Enough, I'm not gonna be terrorized."
I said, "Take off everything"
except for the little green phone."
There you go, this is Biscuit Blitz.
This is what everyone's talking about?
All you do is line up the little pretend biscuits,
- and then... oh, they explode.
- Mmm, good!
It talks.
Hey, how are ya?
I'm Chuck, and I... love you.
Just do that one, right there.
Leave us, Carol!
A spokesman for the FEC announced that there will be a special election to fill all 37 vacant Senate seats.
A gruesome reminder to always make sure someone is driving your party bus.
That's our show.
Good night.
Hey, there you are.
Great work on that Biscuit Blitz piece.
I think that's one of the
- best segments we've ever done.
- It was?
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah.
And I was thinking, someone who's capable of producing such high quality content surely deserves a promotion.
- A promotion, like Aidan?
- Oh, definitely.
Above all the Aidans.
But, Katie, you produced it, right?
You should get all the glory.
Maybe you should be given the employee of the month hat.
No, it was me!
I produced the segment!
I deserve the hat!
Of course it was you, Carol.
It was terrible.
It was the worst segment we've ever done.
- Is there a hat for that?
- Carol, news stories usually answer the questions who, what, and why.
Yours did, in a way.
Who is this woman?
What is she doing?
Why is she ruining my life?
So was it worth it?
Did your source crack open the story of a lifetime?
'Cause I have a slight suspicion he did not, and you're starting to feel
- a bit like an idiot right now.
- Well, you're wrong.
- He did, and I don't.
- You're lying.
Like that time I asked if you'd ever tried sushi.
I have, it was... wet and smoky?
My source was legit, okay?
And he confirmed that I am big-time right.
Well, we can't just sit on a story like that, can we?
- Mm-mm.
- Let's lead with it tomorrow.
- Great.
- Great, and when it airs,
I'll buy you a celebratory dinner, just remind me, what are your favorite
- sushi rolls again?
- Sweet tuna, super crab, dragon carnival, Colorado rolls, and, my personal favorite, a big ol' bowl of snake eggs.
Mom, you're on my sad couch.
Scooch over.
I'm sorry I made a mess of your piece.
I guess I hustled too close to the sun.
Yeah, so did I. Now I have 24 hours to just create a story out of thin air or admit that Greg was right and that I have terrible instincts.
Don't you listen to him.
You know who had terrible instincts?
Your great-aunt.
She married two different serial killers.
But, Mom, why would Greg say it if it wasn't true?
You know, insults are just a sign of insecurity.
You remember your high school bully.
She used to say, "Katie's a bad basketball player," when she was the one in the wheelchair.
Mom, you're right.
Why is Greg being so hard on me?
He called me an idiot and said I'd make a fool of myself.
Do you think he's covering up some weird insecurity?
Maybe that's a story.
Who?
Greg.
What?
Being weird.
Why?
Who knows?
- Me.
No, I don't.
- I'm gonna do some more reporter-ing and find out, 'cause, thanks to you, Mom,
- I have another hunch.
- Now that I've helped you,
- I can finally take a nap.
- Mom!
I knew you were gonna say it like that.
Okay, fine, I'll keep hustling.
I'll keep hustling.
Good morning, Greg.
I think I've finally cracked the story, and I've got all the evidence
- I need right here.
- That is a tiny penguin.
It's... oh.
Well, if you're sure about this, we should do it properly.
- Mm-hmm.
- Right, come on in, everyone.
Katie has the story of a lifetime.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
This should be very interesting.
Especially since I tricked Carol into telling me your source was a 12-year-old boy.
He was 11, and that's not the story I'm talking about.
I haven't cracked my phone hacking story yet, but what I did crack is the story of why you're being such a turd to me.
I thought more of us were going to murmur.
Katie, I'm not sure what it is you think you found.
You don't think I'm an amazing reporter, but check this, Jack...
Cool phrase.
You started acting weird when I wanted to meet with an anonymous source, and here's why, Jack.
You once had your own anonymous source, and this happened.
Instincts Attack!
Oh, no.
Tonight on this live special, we'll be making the world's first human contact with the Loch Ness Monster.
- Wait... what?
- I got what seemed like a credible tip from an Internet renowned monster scientist.
Let's just fast-forward, shall we?
Three hours later.
Well, that was a load of crap.
All we found was a boot.
Whose bloody, stupid idea was this then, eh?
Eh?
Any of you?
Did I do that?
In my defense, we had just gotten "Family Matters"
in the UK, so that was actually a very cool thing to say.
I didn't make a fool of myself.
You made a fool of yourself.
I didn't have bad instincts.
- You had bad instincts.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Okay, so now we're doing the murmur at the end.
Hey, Chuck.
Can I help you with something?
Actually, I do need something.
Can you get me my eye drops?
They're in the trunk of my car next to what may seem like makeup for men.
It's actually makeup
- for women, that I use.
- Ah, you have dry eye from playing Biscuit Blitz all night.
I didn't play all night.
I took a long break to pee into that jar.
You're only on level three?
Ah, I know the problem.
You're not using Biscuit Bombs.
I don't need to.
I know what I'm doing.
Shh, honey, honey, honey, you need to listen to someone who knows better.

Katie, just dial it back a tad.
I don't know!
Why are you doing this?
It's my birthday.
It's your birthday?
I'm so sorry, but I made you a blanket that will say,
- "Happy birthday, Source."
- Why are you here again?
- Get out of our lives!
- Should we run?
Mm-hmm.
Portia, I'm not good at apologizing.
Uh, was that it?
Well, let me try this again in language you understand.

Yes, Portia, of course.

And from now on, I will listen and not always assume I know best.
Maybe I am good at apologizing.
Hey, Chuck, I think you just got hacked.
The "New York Post" published your fiber journals.
What?
Oh, God.
I hope they don't find my drunk voice mails to Nancy Pelosi.
I can explain the nickname "Captain Orgasm."
- It's worse than it sounds.
- You know, just a piece
- of advice, when I was hacked...
- I'm not listening to you.
I know about this.
I know about everything.

Oh, you take that, Aidan.
I'm gonna rub his face in it.
That twerp.
Wait, wait, I found something.
It's the other boot.
Well, my career in England's over.
Maybe I could move to America, become a better version of myself, like Stefan Ur'kel.
Thanks for nothing, Nessie.
Girls, prepare to be more obsolete than you already are.
Which will be hard.
You're one step above newspapers.
Behold, the future!
Oh, no.
I'm still here in the future?
Or, Han, your sister's here.
Hello, mola, Konichiwa.
I guess now's a good time to admit that I ate a bunch of shrooms and I'm seeing a robot in a bowtie.
This is a room service robot that delivers food.
My aunt's Holiday Inn went belly-up.
I got this and one night stand.
That's the only one night stand you're ever gonna get.
Must be a different kind of room service than they have at Tuggington's Hourly Motel.
Where the first tug is free.
R2, thank God.
I thought I lost you when we blew up the Death Star.
Would you like a late check out?
Sorry, toots.
I checked out years ago.
List diner specials.
You have ordered four adult films.
That's a lie.
I've only ordered three.
Shut down, robot.
Hey!
Hey!
This is what happens when you get a robot for free!
R2, no!
Yoda's our friend!
Somebody help me!
If that thing could show cleavage and steal silver wear,
I'd be out of a job.
*2 BROKE GIRLS* Season 06 Episode 15 "And the Turtle Sense"
I can't wait for our date either, Bobby.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
You hang up first.
No, you hang up...
Oh, he hung up.
I'm liking this guy more and more.
I know.
Isn't Bobby the cutest?
Not smoking Chinese baby cute, but not bad.
Max, I'm so excited.
This is the first date I'll be going on since Julia Roberts could still open a romantic comedy.
I'm still pissed at them for stealing my life story for "Pretty Woman."
Jason Alexander's character was totally me.
For our date, he's thinking of taking me on an afternoon picnic in the park.
The pretty one, where you crotch punched that mime into a pond.
You know the fact that Bobby's taking you on a day date is a bad sign, right?
It probably means he's married.
Or worse, afraid of the dark.
Actually, the day date was my idea.
You know we're not married, right?
That's not why I call you my old lady.
It's cause you write thank you notes and use the word jeepers.
Jeepers, Max!
I just figured if I go out at night, you'll have to run the dessert bar alone and you've never done that before.
I've also never flossed my back teeth.
And they're fine when it's not windy.
I got this.
Hey, girls.
I just thought I'd take a walk and stretch my knees.
Then I remembered I don't have any.
Earl, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max will be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Ooh, speaking of disasters, that reminds me,
I have to return "Risky Business" to Blockbuster.
When do they close?
2009.
So I still have time.
Hey, guys, look.
It's a groundhog.
So it's gonna be an early spring.
No.
He saw his shadow this year.
Know your facts.
Earl, you're supposed to be in the diner.
I had to ask our shrimp supplier to cover for you.
I thought your mother was our shrimp supplier.
Han, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max'll be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Sure, like when I had her run the diner by herself.
Which never happened because I'm not a damn fool!
Let's go, Earl.
All right, fine.
I left my knees there, anyway.
Hey, I was, uh...
I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd hop on two subways and a Citi Bike and come say hi.
A Citi Bike?
Oh, this city gal is flattered.
Jeepers.
Isn't he the cutest?
Oh, not dog running in his sleep cute, but I'm all right.
Bobby, I have some good news.
I don't want you to think I'm loose or fast or whatever the kids say, but I am available for a night date, like a person.
Hey, really?
That's great.
I usually save my day dates for my grandma.
She likes a noon dinner.
- I like a noon...
- No.
Since we're going out at night,
I can cancel all the romantic errands we were gonna run to the bank and my dry cleaners.
Now I can take you to a movie.
There's this new theater that has couches and waiter service.
Wow.
We work in a restaurant and we don't have waiter service.
He has a bank and clean clothes?
Caroline, don't screw this up.
Paging Dr. Pringle, you're needed in my stomach.
Okay, pop quiz on running the dessert bar.
What do you do if a customer chokes?
Look, if I have to cut a hole in someone's throat,
I'll cut a hole in someone's throat.
Cutting a hole in people can't be your answer for everything.
Next one.
What do you do if there's a fire?
Follow up question: did I or did I not start said fire?
Either way, I'm cutting a hole in someone.
Okay you failed this quiz now twice.
Especially the essay portion.
I'm calling Bobby and canceling.
Oh.
They're home.
He means, hey, girls.
How did you get a key to our apartment?
They specifically say on them,
"Do not copy for Oleg."
I find that when you go in a Home Depot pantless, they'll do anything to get you out quick.
We come down here on our date nights to pretend we're two destitute girls who are sleeping together for warmth.
Why do you guys come here?
Why don't you go to, like, I don't know, Olive Garden?
Yeah, this is date night.
Not find an overweight guy to film us night.
Staying in is a tradition.
You know, in Poland, you really can't go outside because of all the wild dogs.
And if it wasn't for the wolves,
You wouldn't be able to walk anywhere.
Of course, you still need your vulture stick.
Speaking of vultures circling a dead body,
Caroline's got a date tonight.
Oh, my God, Max.
That's a good one.
Say it again.
No, it's not a joke.
I'm really going on a date.
Stop it!
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna pee.
I'm going to that new movie theater with couches.
It's like watching at home, but there isn't a giant spring poking you in the butt.
Play your cards right, there will be.
Here you go.
Two Liquor Doodles.
And speaking of licking her doodle...
No.
What are you doing here?
I thought I left you at the apartment.
Which is what my abductor said when I ran into him at Baskin-Robbins.
Wait, did he work there or did you just want ice cream?
Because if he worked there, why would you go...
Anyway, I'm having Bobby pick me up here so I can keep my hand on the fire extinguisher until we get to our wherever it is he's taking me.
No.
You don't trust me.
You think I'm gonna mess this place up.
Ah, Caroline gone yet?
'Cause I got us some high-grade pot... to turn into the authorities immediately.
Earl, you go AWOL more often than Mischa Barton on a movie set.
What do I have to do to keep you in that diner?
Well a date with Halle Berry would be nice.
I also wouldn't hate minimum wage.
How about a butterscotch pudding?
That works, too.
That pudding has saved me thousands over the years.
And who told him about minimum wage?
Will you just go on your date already?
- Ashley!
- Ashleigh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Sorority sisters?
Max, you hate them.
I mean, I was a sorority sister.
You look so good!
Shut up, I gained, like, two pounds.
Oh, you shut up.
You look like you're dying.
Just relax, I'll take care of them.
And I don't mean calling my friend Dmitri, who has his own dumpster.
Oh, sorority sisters, huh?
Epsilon Phis!
And we haven't seen each other in, like, three days.
Uh, that's pretty obvious.
Let me get you some menus.
Eh?
Nobody got hurt.
I'd feel better if your eye wasn't twitching like that.
Wow, Caroline, you look beautiful.
Speaking of beautiful, who built this awesome place?
This guy.
I'm going out with him tonight.
He's cute, too.
Okay, I know you're talking about me, but I get jealous.
I'm gonna tell you what I always told my mom:
go out, get plastered and you don't have to wait till the morning after to take the pill.
That's just a name.
It's okay, I took mine on the way over.
Have fun Max.
Do not have fun.
Bye!
I can handle a few sorority girls.
Let me make sure I still have Dmitri's number.
Bunny!
Ashley!
Ashleigh!
God, they're multiplying.
Oh, you look so good!
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up!
You guys should really listen to each other.
Couches in movie theaters?
I feel like Kate Middleton right now.
I'm glad you're easily impressed.
For Valentine's Day, I'll take you to the Super Target cafe.
Well I can't just sit on that kinda news.
Let me just call Max and tell her.
Nope, straight to her outgoing fart message.
Bon soir, everybody.
My name is Marcel, and I will be the curator for this evening's cinematic experience.
The film, which Owen Gleiberman has hailed, a Kubrickesque tour de force, will be screening in DCP...
Uh, yes?
A question from a fellow cinephile?
Do I have to order the seasoned fries separate from the regular ones or can I just get them mixed?
It's a dollar extra.
I'll be taking orders once the movie starts.
Whatever.
Hey, great question about the fries.
I had a follow up about free refills.
Everything okay?
I was just, um, checking this place on Yelp.
And to see if the dessert bar was on the news.
Or engulfed in flames.
Shh.
You saw the dancing hot dog.
No cell phones.
What are you guys doing here?
Did I cover my bed in "Dexter" tarp for nothing?
We're on a date.
Trying like crazy not to have sex.
Usually, when the lights go down in the movie, so do my pants.
And then, so do I.
And of course we would have to see a super sexy poster of Steve Buscemi in the lobby.
Hi, I'm Bobby.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry, I'm no Steve Buscemi.
I had braces in high school.
You guys brought Barbara on your date with you?
Of course not.
She's with the babysitter.
We used the carriage to sneak in our dinner.
Hey, we're not gonna pay movie chicken prices.
Oleg, tear me off a leg.
Good.
Yeah.
Was that a siren?
Oh, it's coming from the screen.
The movie's called "Sirens."
I know, but I thought I heard another one under it that sounded like it could be heading for a dessert bar.
Are you not having a good time?
Do you not like movies?
Please tell me you don't like plays.
No, I'm having a great time.
And please tell me you don't consider musicals plays.
Hey, I don't wanna check in on Max 'cause she'll think I don't trust her.
So can you check in on Max?
Because I really don't trust her.
Uh, I got chicken hands!
Why don't you ask your boyfriend to do it?
First, we haven't discussed labels yet.
And second, I don't want him to think I'm not having fun.
I'm having so much fun.
I would go to a musical if it was important to you
I'll do it.
Texting?
Out.
And don't come back until you gain some respect for the art form.
Who ordered the chili dog with the nachos on top?
Well it probably all for the best.
Since you're leaving anyways, you can check in on Max in person.
I guess.
Since we're about to chicken up your bed.
Epsilon Phi until we die!
Epsilon Phi until we die!
Ah, heard you the first time.
I'm working on it.
Aw, come on, Ashley!
That's something I'd expect from Ashleigh.
Can you do something?
Uh, uhh.
Hey you, uh, they're trying to let a poor girl in the sorority.
Who?
Is she ugly?
There you go.
See?
She's as annoying as she was five minutes ago.
Now what do you people want?
Um, more shots.
Also, Ashleigh threw up in Ashley's purse.
Ah, back from the liquor store.
Sorry I took so long.
I didn't realize I was at a Pottery Barn.
Well, while I've got you confused,
How about you get back to work and bring out these drinks for me?
I am not confused.
I realized
I'm a waitress at this TGIFridays.
Congratulate us!
We've just gone two hours without having sex.
Which breaks our old record by pretty close to two hours.
You know, Caroline asked us to check up on you because she was worried.
We're not supposed to tell you that.
But I had to leave a half a roasted chicken in the movie theater.
So I am!
Does she have any idea what I've been through tonight with these sorority girls?
For all she knows, I'm sober.
Sorority girls, huh?
I was in a sorority once.
Until they found me.
What's going on?
We've been waiting for our next round of drinks for, like, ever.
Wow, Max.
Are you really gonna let the cast of "Pitch Perfect"
talk to you like that?
People in charge don't punch sorority girls.
People in charge don't punch sorority girls.
And can we get separate checks?
Or do they?
Separate checks?
Do I look like a mathologist to you?
Is that a problem?
'Cause I'd hate to have to say something on Yelp.
Yelp?
Caroline checks that more than she Googles herself.
Uh, not a problem at all.
Drinks and separate checks... whatever that is... coming right up!
Thanks!
You're the cutest.
No, you are.
Looks like someone's in the weeds and not just smoking it for a change.
Don't just kneel there, bring these drinks out.
I have to learn all of math in ten minutes.
All right, I'll stay.
But only because I want you to see how it feels when the shoe is on the...
Serve the damn drinks!
She gets it.
How long you been working at this Fridays, sonny?
Uh, is everything all right?
You've been to the bathroom nine times.
Are you a drug addict?
"Candy Crush" junkie?
We can deal with it together.
I'm sorry, Bobby, but you know how turtles can sense if their turtle best friend is stuck upside down on its shell, its turtle legs all wiggling in the air?
So it is drugs.
Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.
We went through that with my mom.
It's a killer.
We almost lost our house.
No, Max and I are the turtles.
And I can feel she's trapped on her back at the dessert bar.
All right, look, I don't know Max that well.
But I've gotten to know you a little bit and you have a really good, really beautiful head on your shoulders.
You trusted Max.
You should trust your own instincts.
You're right.
I do have a nice shaped head.
And I'm gonna stop worrying that she might
- burn the bar down.
- Good.
What?
Seriously?
I put a ton of work into that place.
You know what?
This movie sucks.
Let's get out of here and go get some dessert.
I know a great place.
That is so sweet.
And I was so worried you'd think I was crazy.
Oh, you're bananas.
But I like bananas.
Not the fruit.
The texture grosses me out.
But you.
I could kiss you for that.
You know, you actually could.
You're right, I can.
Yeah, we should get out of here.
Hello?
It's taking longer than it took me to almost graduate.
Just hang onto your hair extensions.
They're obvious?
My turtle sense was right.
Max is on her back and she's not under a boy turtle.
Maybe she's all right.
I don't smell fire and everyone's shoulders are still in their sockets.
Why are separate checks taking so long?
Can we please get our change?
Um, you put the apps on Bunny's bill, right?
'Cause she ate the most, as per ush.
Stop telling people I eat!
Stop telling people my LSAT scores.
Stop talking!
Now I have to start over.
I have a lot of numbers in my head and they're all angry.
I have to help her.
Separate checks?
Max calls 13 "ten three."
Caroline, wait.
Let her try and handle this on her own.
Otherwise, we'll never be able to go on a second date.
But she really nee...
There's gonna be a second date?
Okay, listen up, everybody!
Calm down!
Here's what we're gonna do instead of separate checks:
I'm not good at math, but I have been a negotiations expert for ten three years.
Ashley, you're gonna get $6 from Bunny's PayPal account and she's gonna do your nails.
Bunny, you're gonna Venmo Amber $20
And she's gonna let you borrow her gay friend Dave for your sister's wed.
Everybody good?
You've got ten three minutes to decide.
We're good.
Okay, problem solved.
Max, that was amazing.
I knew you could do that on your own.
No you didn't, you were spying on me.
Her turtle sense went off.
Is it strange that I'm a little sad that you don't need me?
I didn't say I don't need you, but you are a little sad.
Earl, it was a pleasure waiting tables at your side.
You and I have a chemistry you can't make in a lab.
You have a real strange way of talking to dudes.
Uh, hi.
Did you guys know there are two naked people eating chicken off each other in there?
What?
I haven't chicken-proofed those sinks.
All right, I'm closing my eyes and then I'm coming in.
Isn't he brave?
So did he bravely go where no man has gone before?
Under your sweater?
- No, but we were smooching in the movie.
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up.
- No, really, shut your damn mouth, I'm exhausted.
Girls, prepare to be more obsolete than you already are.
Which will be hard.
You're one step above newspapers.
Behold, the future!
Oh, no.
I'm still here in the future?
Or, Han, your sister's here.
Hello, mola, Konichiwa.
I guess now's a good time to admit that I ate a bunch of shrooms and I'm seeing a robot in a bowtie.
This is a room service robot that delivers food.
My aunt's Holiday Inn went belly-up.
I got this and one night stand.
That's the only one night stand you're ever gonna get.
Must be a different kind of room service than they have at Tuggington's Hourly Motel.
Where the first tug is free.
R2, thank God.
I thought I lost you when we blew up the Death Star.
Would you like a late check out?
Sorry, toots.
I checked out years ago.
List diner specials.
You have ordered four adult films.
That's a lie.
I've only ordered three.
Shut down, robot.
Hey!
Hey!
This is what happens when you get a robot for free!
R2, no!
Yoda's our friend!
Somebody help me!
If that thing could show cleavage and steal silver wear,
I'd be out of a job.
I can't wait for our date either, Bobby.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
You hang up first.
No, you hang up...
Oh, he hung up.
I'm liking this guy more and more.
I know.
Isn't Bobby the cutest?
Not smoking Chinese baby cute, but not bad.
Max, I'm so excited.
This is the first date I'll be going on since Julia Roberts could still open a romantic comedy.
I'm still pissed at them for stealing my life story for "Pretty Woman."
Jason Alexander's character was totally me.
For our date, he's thinking of taking me on an afternoon picnic in the park.
The pretty one, where you crotch punched that mime into a pond.
You know the fact that Bobby's taking you on a day date is a bad sign, right?
It probably means he's married.
Or worse, afraid of the dark.
Actually, the day date was my idea.
You know we're not married, right?
That's not why I call you my old lady.
It's cause you write thank you notes and use the word jeepers.
Jeepers, Max!
I just figured if I go out at night, you'll have to run the dessert bar alone and you've never done that before.
I've also never flossed my back teeth.
And they're fine when it's not windy.
I got this.
Hey, girls.
I just thought I'd take a walk and stretch my knees.
Then I remembered I don't have any.
Earl, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max will be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Ooh, speaking of disasters, that reminds me,
I have to return "Risky Business" to Blockbuster.
When do they close?
2009.
So I still have time.
Hey, guys, look.
It's a groundhog.
So it's gonna be an early spring.
No.
He saw his shadow this year.
Know your facts.
Earl, you're supposed to be in the diner.
I had to ask our shrimp supplier to cover for you.
I thought your mother was our shrimp supplier.
Han, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max'll be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Sure, like when I had her run the diner by herself.
Which never happened because I'm not a damn fool!
Let's go, Earl.
All right, fine.
I left my knees there, anyway.
Hey, I was, uh...
I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd hop on two subways and a Citi Bike and come say hi.
A Citi Bike?
Oh, this city gal is flattered.
Jeepers.
Isn't he the cutest?
Oh, not dog running in his sleep cute, but I'm all right.
Bobby, I have some good news.
I don't want you to think I'm loose or fast or whatever the kids say, but I am available for a night date, like a person.
Hey, really?
That's great.
I usually save my day dates for my grandma.
She likes a noon dinner.
- I like a noon...
- No.
Since we're going out at night,
I can cancel all the romantic errands we were gonna run to the bank and my dry cleaners.
Now I can take you to a movie.
There's this new theater that has couches and waiter service.
Wow.
We work in a restaurant and we don't have waiter service.
He has a bank and clean clothes?
Caroline, don't screw this up.
Paging Dr. Pringle, you're needed in my stomach.
Okay, pop quiz on running the dessert bar.
What do you do if a customer chokes?
Look, if I have to cut a hole in someone's throat,
I'll cut a hole in someone's throat.
Cutting a hole in people can't be your answer for everything.
Next one.
What do you do if there's a fire?
Follow up question: did I or did I not start said fire?
Either way, I'm cutting a hole in someone.
Okay you failed this quiz now twice.
Especially the essay portion.
I'm calling Bobby and canceling.
Oh.
They're home.
He means, hey, girls.
How did you get a key to our apartment?
They specifically say on them,
"Do not copy for Oleg."
I find that when you go in a Home Depot pantless, they'll do anything to get you out quick.
We come down here on our date nights to pretend we're two destitute girls who are sleeping together for warmth.
Why do you guys come here?
Why don't you go to, like, I don't know, Olive Garden?
Yeah, this is date night.
Not find an overweight guy to film us night.
Staying in is a tradition.
You know, in Poland, you really can't go outside because of all the wild dogs.
And if it wasn't for the wolves,
You wouldn't be able to walk anywhere.
Of course, you still need your vulture stick.
Speaking of vultures circling a dead body,
Caroline's got a date tonight.
Oh, my God, Max.
That's a good one.
Say it again.
No, it's not a joke.
I'm really going on a date.
Stop it!
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna pee.
I'm going to that new movie theater with couches.
It's like watching at home, but there isn't a giant spring poking you in the butt.
Play your cards right, there will be.
Here you go.
Two Liquor Doodles.
And speaking of licking her doodle...
No.
What are you doing here?
I thought I left you at the apartment.
Which is what my abductor said when I ran into him at Baskin-Robbins.
Wait, did he work there or did you just want ice cream?
Because if he worked there, why would you go...
Anyway, I'm having Bobby pick me up here so I can keep my hand on the fire extinguisher until we get to our wherever it is he's taking me.
No.
You don't trust me.
You think I'm gonna mess this place up.
Ah, Caroline gone yet?
'Cause I got us some high-grade pot... to turn into the authorities immediately.
Earl, you go AWOL more often than Mischa Barton on a movie set.
What do I have to do to keep you in that diner?
Well a date with Halle Berry would be nice.
I also wouldn't hate minimum wage.
How about a butterscotch pudding?
That works, too.
That pudding has saved me thousands over the years.
And who told him about minimum wage?
Will you just go on your date already?
- Ashley!
- Ashleigh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Sorority sisters?
Max, you hate them.
I mean, I was a sorority sister.
You look so good!
Shut up, I gained, like, two pounds.
Oh, you shut up.
You look like you're dying.
Just relax, I'll take care of them.
And I don't mean calling my friend Dmitri, who has his own dumpster.
Oh, sorority sisters, huh?
Epsilon Phis!
And we haven't seen each other in, like, three days.
Uh, that's pretty obvious.
Let me get you some menus.
Eh?
Nobody got hurt.
I'd feel better if your eye wasn't twitching like that.
Wow, Caroline, you look beautiful.
Speaking of beautiful, who built this awesome place?

I'm going out with him tonight.
He's cute, too.
Okay, I know you're talking about me, but I get jealous.
I'm gonna tell you what I always told my mom:

That's just a name.
It's okay, I took mine on the way over.
Have fun Max.
Do not have fun.
Bye!
I can handle a few sorority girls.
Let me make sure I still have Dmitri's number.
Bunny!
Ashley!
Ashleigh!
God, they're multiplying.
Oh, you look so good!
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up!
You guys should really listen to each other.
Couches in movie theaters?
I feel like Kate Middleton right now.
I'm glad you're easily impressed.
For Valentine's Day, I'll take you to the Super Target cafe.
Well I can't just sit on that kinda news.

She's with the babysitter.
We used the carriage to sneak in our dinner.

Oh, it's coming from the screen.
The movie's called "Sirens."
I know, but I thought I heard another one under it that sounded like it could be heading for a dessert bar.
Are you not having a good time?
Do you not like movies?
Please tell me you don't like plays.
No, I'm having a great time.
And please tell me you don't consider musicals plays.
Hey, I don't wanna check in on Max 'cause she'll think I don't trust her.
So can you check in on Max?
Because I really don't trust her.
Uh, I got chicken hands!
Why don't you ask your boyfriend to do it?
First, we haven't discussed labels yet.
And second, I don't want him to think I'm not having fun.
I'm having so much fun.
I would go to a musical if it was important to you
I'll do it.
Texting?
Out.
And don't come back until you gain some respect for the art form.
Who ordered the chili dog with the nachos on top?
Well it probably all for the best.
Since you're leaving anyways, you can check in on Max in person.
I guess.
Since we're about to chicken up your bed.
Epsilon Phi until we die!
Epsilon Phi until we die!
Ah, heard you the first time.
I'm working on it.
Aw, come on, Ashley!
That's something I'd expect from Ashleigh.
Can you do something?
Uh, uhh.
Hey you, uh, they're trying to let a poor girl in the sorority.
Who?
Is she ugly?
There you go.
See?
She's as annoying as she was five minutes ago.
Now what do you people want?
Um, more shots.
Also, Ashleigh threw up in Ashley's purse.
Ah, back from the liquor store.
Sorry I took so long.
I didn't realize I was at a Pottery Barn.
Well, while I've got you confused,
How about you get back to work and bring out these drinks for me?
I am not confused.
I realized
I'm a waitress at this TGIFridays.
Congratulate us!
We've just gone two hours without having sex.
Which breaks our old record by pretty close to two hours.
You know, Caroline asked us to check up on you because she was worried.
We're not supposed to tell you that.
But I had to leave a half a roasted chicken in the movie theater.
So I am!
Does she have any idea what I've been through tonight with these sorority girls?
For all she knows, I'm sober.
Sorority girls, huh?
I was in a sorority once.
Until they found me.
What's going on?
We've been waiting for our next round of drinks for, like, ever.
Wow, Max.
Are you really gonna let the cast of "Pitch Perfect"
talk to you like that?
People in charge don't punch sorority girls.
People in charge don't punch sorority girls.
And can we get separate checks?
Or do they?
Separate checks?
Do I look like a mathologist to you?
Is that a problem?
'Cause I'd hate to have to say something on Yelp.
Yelp?
Caroline checks that more than she Googles herself.
Uh, not a problem at all.
Drinks and separate checks... whatever that is... coming right up!
Thanks!
You're the cutest.
No, you are.
Looks like someone's in the weeds and not just smoking it for a change.
Don't just kneel there, bring these drinks out.
I have to learn all of math in ten minutes.
All right, I'll stay.
But only because I want you to see how it feels when the shoe is on the...
Serve the damn drinks!
She gets it.
How long you been working at this Fridays, sonny?
Uh, is everything all right?
You've been to the bathroom nine times.
Are you a drug addict?
"Candy Crush" junkie?
We can deal with it together.
I'm sorry, Bobby, but you know how turtles can sense if their turtle best friend is stuck upside down on its shell, its turtle legs all wiggling in the air?
So it is drugs.
Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.
We went through that with my mom.
It's a killer.
We almost lost our house.
No, Max and I are the turtles.
And I can feel she's trapped on her back at the dessert bar.
All right, look, I don't know Max that well.
But I've gotten to know you a little bit and you have a really good, really beautiful head on your shoulders.
You trusted Max.
You should trust your own instincts.
You're right.
I do have a nice shaped head.
And I'm gonna stop worrying that she might
- burn the bar down.
- Good.
What?
Seriously?
I put a ton of work into that place.
You know what?
This movie sucks.
Let's get out of here and go get some dessert.
I know a great place.
That is so sweet.
And I was so worried you'd think I was crazy.
Oh, you're bananas.
But I like bananas.
Not the fruit.
The texture grosses me out.
But you.
I could kiss you for that.
You know, you actually could.
You're right, I can.
Yeah, we should get out of here.
Hello?
It's taking longer than it took me to almost graduate.
Just hang onto your hair extensions.
They're obvious?
My turtle sense was right.
Max is on her back and she's not under a boy turtle.
Maybe she's all right.
I don't smell fire and everyone's shoulders are still in their sockets.
Why are separate checks taking so long?
Can we please get our change?
Um, you put the apps on Bunny's bill, right?
'Cause she ate the most, as per ush.
Stop telling people I eat!
Stop telling people my LSAT scores.
Stop talking!
Now I have to start over.
I have a lot of numbers in my head and they're all angry.
I have to help her.
Separate checks?
Max calls 13 "ten three."
Caroline, wait.
Let her try and handle this on her own.
Otherwise, we'll never be able to go on a second date.
But she really nee...
There's gonna be a second date?
Okay, listen up, everybody!
Calm down!
Here's what we're gonna do instead of separate checks:
I'm not good at math, but I have been a negotiations expert for ten three years.
Ashley, you're gonna get $6 from Bunny's PayPal account and she's gonna do your nails.
Bunny, you're gonna Venmo Amber $20
And she's gonna let you borrow her gay friend Dave for your sister's wed.
Everybody good?
You've got ten three minutes to decide.
We're good.
Okay, problem solved.
Max, that was amazing.
I knew you could do that on your own.
No you didn't, you were spying on me.
Her turtle sense went off.
Is it strange that I'm a little sad that you don't need me?
I didn't say I don't need you, but you are a little sad.
Earl, it was a pleasure waiting tables at your side.
You and I have a chemistry you can't make in a lab.
You have a real strange way of talking to dudes.
Uh, hi.
Did you guys know there are two naked people eating chicken off each other in there?
What?
I haven't chicken-proofed those sinks.
All right, I'm closing my eyes and then I'm coming in.
Isn't he brave?
So did he bravely go where no man has gone before?
Under your sweater?
No, but we were smooching in the movie.
Shut up!
- No, you shut up.
- No, really, shut your damn mouth, I'm exhausted.
Girls, prepare to be more obsolete than you already are.
Which will be hard.
You're one step above newspapers.
Behold, the future!
Oh, no.
I'm still here in the future?
(mechanical chattering)
Or, Han, your sister's here.
Hello, mola, Konichiwa.
I guess now's a good time to admit that I ate a bunch of shrooms and I'm seeing a robot in a bowtie.
This is a room service robot that delivers food.
My aunt's Holiday Inn went belly-up.
I got this and one night stand.
That's the only one night stand you're ever gonna get.
Must be a different kind of room service than they have at Tuggington's Hourly Motel.
Where the first tug is free.
(mechanical chattering)
- R2, thank God.
I thought I lost you when we blew up the Death Star.
Would you like a late check out?
Sorry, toots.
I checked out years ago.
List diner specials.
You have ordered four adult films.
That's a lie.
I've only ordered three.
Shut down, robot.
Hey!
Hey!
This is what happens when you get a robot for free!
(beeping)
R2, no!
Yoda's our friend!
HAN:
Somebody help me!
If that thing could show cleavage and steal silver wear,
I'd be out of a job.
(Peter Bjorn and John) ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(cash register bell dings)
I can't wait for our date either, Bobby.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
You hang up first.
No, you hang up...
Oh, he hung up.
I'm liking this guy more and more.
I know.
Isn't Bobby the cutest?
Not smoking Chinese baby cute, but not bad.
Max, I'm so excited.
This is the first date I'll be going on since Julia Roberts could still open a romantic comedy.
I'm still pissed at them for stealing my life story for "Pretty Woman."
Jason Alexander's character was totally me.
For our date, he's thinking of taking me on an afternoon picnic in the park.
The pretty one, where you crotch punched that mime into a pond.
You know the fact that Bobby's taking you on a day date is a bad sign, right?
It probably means he's married.
Or worse, afraid of the dark.
Actually, the day date was my idea.
You know we're not married, right?
That's not why I call you my old lady.
It's cause you write thank you notes and use the word jeepers.
Jeepers, Max!
I just figured if I go out at night, you'll have to run the dessert bar alone and you've never done that before.
I've also never flossed my back teeth.
And they're fine when it's not windy.
I got this.
Hey, girls.
I just thought I'd take a walk and stretch my knees.
Then I remembered I don't have any.
Earl, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max will be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Ooh, speaking of disasters, that reminds me,
I have to return "Risky Business" to Blockbuster.
When do they close?
2009.
So I still have time.
MAX:
Hey, guys, look.
It's a groundhog.
So it's gonna be an early spring.
No.
He saw his shadow this year.
Know your facts.
Earl, you're supposed to be in the diner.
I had to ask our shrimp supplier to cover for you.
I thought your mother was our shrimp supplier.
Han, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max'll be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Sure, like when I had her run the diner by herself.
Which never happened because I'm not a damn fool!
Let's go, Earl.
All right, fine.
I left my knees there, anyway.
Hey, I was, uh...
I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd hop on two subways and a Citi Bike and come say hi.
A Citi Bike?
Oh, this city gal is flattered.
Jeepers.
Isn't he the cutest?
Oh, not dog running in his sleep cute, but I'm all right.
Bobby, I have some good news.
I don't want you to think I'm loose or fast or whatever the kids say, but I am available for a night date, like a person.
Hey, really?
That's great.
I usually save my day dates for my grandma.
She likes a noon dinner.
- I like a noon...
- No.
Since we're going out at night,
I can cancel all the romantic errands we were gonna run to the bank and my dry cleaners.
Now I can take you to a movie.
There's this new theater that has couches and waiter service.
Wow.
We work in a restaurant and we don't have waiter service.
He has a bank and clean clothes?
- Caroline, don't screw this up.
- (laughs)
Paging Dr. Pringle, you're needed in my stomach.
Okay, pop quiz on running the dessert bar.
What do you do if a customer chokes?
Look, if I have to cut a hole in someone's throat,
I'll cut a hole in someone's throat.
Cutting a hole in people can't be your answer for everything.
Next one.
What do you do if there's a fire?
Follow up question: did I or did I not start said fire?
Either way, I'm cutting a hole in someone.
Okay you failed this quiz now twice.
Especially the essay portion.
I'm calling Bobby and canceling.
Oh.
They're home.
He means, hey, girls.
How did you get a key to our apartment?
They specifically say on them,
"Do not copy for Oleg."
I find that when you go in a Home Depot pantless, they'll do anything to get you out quick.
We come down here on our date nights to pretend we're two destitute girls who are sleeping together for warmth.
Why do you guys come here?
Why don't you go to, like, I don't know, Olive Garden?
Yeah, this is date night.
Not find an overweight guy to film us night.
Staying in is a tradition.
You know, in Poland, you really can't go outside because of all the wild dogs.
And if it wasn't for the wolves,
You wouldn't be able to walk anywhere.
Of course, you still need your vulture stick.
Speaking of vultures circling a dead body,
Caroline's got a date tonight.
(laughs)
Oh, my God, Max.
That's a good one.
Say it again.
No, it's not a joke.
I'm really going on a date.
(laughs)
Stop it!
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna pee.
I'm going to that new movie theater with couches.
It's like watching at home, but there isn't a giant spring poking you in the butt.
Play your cards right, there will be.
Here you go.
Two Liquor Doodles.
And speaking of licking her doodle...
No.
What are you doing here?
I thought I left you at the apartment.
Which is what my abductor said when I ran into him at Baskin-Robbins.
Wait, did he work there or did you just want ice cream?
Because if he worked there, why would you go...
Anyway, I'm having Bobby pick me up here so I can keep my hand on the fire extinguisher until we get to our wherever it is he's taking me.
No.
You don't trust me.
You think I'm gonna mess this place up.
Ah, Caroline gone yet?
'Cause I got us some high-grade pot... to turn into the authorities immediately.
Earl, you go AWOL more often than Mischa Barton on a movie set.
What do I have to do to keep you in that diner?
Well a date with Halle Berry would be nice.
I also wouldn't hate minimum wage.
How about a butterscotch pudding?
That works, too.
That pudding has saved me thousands over the years.
And who told him about minimum wage?
Will you just go on your date already?
- (gasps) Ashley!
- Ashleigh!
(both scream) both:
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Sorority sisters?
Max, you hate them.
I mean, I was a sorority sister.
You look so good!
Shut up, I gained, like, two pounds.
Oh, you shut up.
You look like you're dying.
Just relax, I'll take care of them.
And I don't mean calling my friend Dmitri, who has his own dumpster.
Oh, sorority sisters, huh?
Epsilon Phis!
And we haven't seen each other in, like, three days.
Uh, that's pretty obvious.
Let me get you some menus.
Eh?
Nobody got hurt.
I'd feel better if your eye wasn't twitching like that.
Wow, Caroline, you look beautiful.
Speaking of beautiful, who built this awesome place?
This guy.
I'm going out with him tonight.
He's cute, too.
Okay, I know you're talking about me, but I get jealous.
I'm gonna tell you what I always told my mom:
go out, get plastered and you don't have to wait till the morning after to take the pill.
That's just a name.
It's okay, I took mine on the way over.
Have fun Max.
Do not have fun.
Bye!
(blows raspberry) I can handle a few sorority girls.
Let me make sure I still have Dmitri's number.
(gasps) Bunny!
Ashley!
Ashleigh!
(all screaming)
God, they're multiplying.
Oh, you look so good!
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up!
You guys should really listen to each other.
Couches in movie theaters?
I feel like Kate Middleton right now.
I'm glad you're easily impressed.
For Valentine's Day, I'll take you to the Super Target cafe.
Well I can't just sit on that kinda news.
Let me just call Max and tell her.
Nope, straight to her outgoing fart message.
Bon soir, everybody.
My name is Marcel, and I will be the curator for this evening's cinematic experience.
The film, which Owen Gleiberman has hailed, a Kubrickesque tour de force, will be screening in DCP...
Uh, yes?
A question from a fellow cinephile?
Do I have to order the seasoned fries separate from the regular ones or can I just get them mixed?
It's a dollar extra.
I'll be taking orders once the movie starts.
Whatever.
Hey, great question about the fries.
I had a follow up about free refills.
Everything okay?
I was just, um, checking this place on Yelp.
And to see if the dessert bar was on the news.
Or engulfed in flames.
Shh.
You saw the dancing hot dog.
No cell phones.
What are you guys doing here?
Did I cover my bed in "Dexter" tarp for nothing?
We're on a date.
Trying like crazy not to have sex.
Usually, when the lights go down in the movie, so do my pants.
And then, so do I.
And of course we would have to see a super sexy poster of Steve Buscemi in the lobby.
Hi, I'm Bobby.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry, I'm no Steve Buscemi.
I had braces in high school.
You guys brought Barbara on your date with you?
Of course not.
She's with the babysitter.
We used the carriage to sneak in our dinner.
Hey, we're not gonna pay movie chicken prices.
Oleg, tear me off a leg.
(ripping sound)
Good.
Yeah.
(siren wailing)
Was that a siren?
Oh, it's coming from the screen.
The movie's called "Sirens."
I know, but I thought I heard another one under it that sounded like it could be heading for a dessert bar.
Are you not having a good time?
Do you not like movies?
Please tell me you don't like plays.
No, I'm having a great time.
And please tell me you don't consider musicals plays.
Hey, I don't wanna check in on Max 'cause she'll think I don't trust her.
So can you check in on Max?
Because I really don't trust her.
Uh, I got chicken hands!
Why don't you ask your boyfriend to do it?
First, we haven't discussed labels yet.
And second, I don't want him to think I'm not having fun.
I'm having so much fun.
I would go to a musical if it was important to you
I'll do it.
Texting?
Out.
And don't come back until you gain some respect for the art form.
Who ordered the chili dog with the nachos on top?
Well it probably all for the best.
Since you're leaving anyways, you can check in on Max in person.
I guess.
Since we're about to chicken up your bed.
(together) Epsilon Phi until we die!
Epsilon Phi until we die!
Ah, heard you the first time.
I'm working on it.
(sighs)
Aw, come on, Ashley!
That's something I'd expect from Ashleigh.
Can you do something?
Uh, uhh.
Hey you, uh, they're trying to let a poor girl in the sorority.
Who?
Is she ugly?

Oh, this city gal is flattered.
Jeepers.
Isn't he the cutest?
Oh, not dog running in his sleep cute, but I'm all right.
Bobby, I have some good news.
I don't want you to think I'm loose or fast or whatever the kids say, but I am available for a night date, like a person.
Hey, really?
That's great.
I usually save my day dates for my grandma.
She likes a noon dinner.
- I like a noon...
- No.
Since we're going out at night,
I can cancel all the romantic errands we were gonna run to the bank and my dry cleaners.
Now I can take you to a movie.
There's this new theater that has couches and waiter service.
Wow.
We work in a restaurant and we don't have waiter service.
He has a bank and clean clothes?
- Caroline, don't screw this up.
- (laughs)
Paging Dr. Pringle, you're needed in my stomach.
Okay, pop quiz on running the dessert bar.
What do you do if a customer chokes?
Look, if I have to cut a hole in someone's throat,
I'll cut a hole in someone's throat.
Cutting a hole in people can't be your answer for everything.
Next one.
What do you do if there's a fire?
Follow up question: did I or did I not start said fire?
Either way, I'm cutting a hole in someone.
Okay you failed this quiz now twice.
Especially the essay portion.
I'm calling Bobby and canceling.
Oh.
They're home.
He means, hey, girls.
How did you get a key to our apartment?
They specifically say on them,
"Do not copy for Oleg."
I find that when you go in a Home Depot pantless, they'll do anything to get you out quick.
We come down here on our date nights to pretend we're two destitute girls who are sleeping together for warmth.
Why do you guys come here?
Why don't you go to, like, I don't know, Olive Garden?
Yeah, this is date night.
Not find an overweight guy to film us night.
Staying in is a tradition.
You know, in Poland, you really can't go outside because of all the wild dogs.
And if it wasn't for the wolves,
You wouldn't be able to walk anywhere.
Of course, you still need your vulture stick.
Speaking of vultures circling a dead body,
Caroline's got a date tonight.
(laughs)
Oh, my God, Max.
That's a good one.
Say it again.
No, it's not a joke.
I'm really going on a date.
(laughs)
Stop it!
Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna pee.
I'm going to that new movie theater with couches.
It's like watching at home, but there isn't a giant spring poking you in the butt.
Play your cards right, there will be.
Here you go.
Two Liquor Doodles.
And speaking of licking her doodle...
No.
What are you doing here?
I thought I left you at the apartment.
Which is what my abductor said when I ran into him at Baskin-Robbins.
Wait, did he work there or did you just want ice cream?
Because if he worked there, why would you go...
Anyway, I'm having Bobby pick me up here so I can keep my hand on the fire extinguisher until we get to our wherever it is he's taking me.
No.
You don't trust me.
You think I'm gonna mess this place up.
Ah, Caroline gone yet?
'Cause I got us some high-grade pot... to turn into the authorities immediately.
Earl, you go AWOL more often than Mischa Barton on a movie set.
What do I have to do to keep you in that diner?
Well a date with Halle Berry would be nice.
I also wouldn't hate minimum wage.
How about a butterscotch pudding?
That works, too.
That pudding has saved me thousands over the years.
And who told him about minimum wage?
Will you just go on your date already?
- (gasps) Ashley!
- Ashleigh!
(both scream) both:
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Sorority sisters?
Max, you hate them.
I mean, I was a sorority sister.
You look so good!
Shut up, I gained, like, two pounds.
Oh, you shut up.
You look like you're dying.
Just relax, I'll take care of them.
And I don't mean calling my friend Dmitri, who has his own dumpster.
Oh, sorority sisters, huh?
Epsilon Phis!
And we haven't seen each other in, like, three days.
Uh, that's pretty obvious.
Let me get you some menus.
Eh?
Nobody got hurt.
I'd feel better if your eye wasn't twitching like that.
Wow, Caroline, you look beautiful.
Speaking of beautiful, who built this awesome place?
This guy.
I'm going out with him tonight.
He's cute, too.
Okay, I know you're talking about me, but I get jealous.
I'm gonna tell you what I always told my mom:
go out, get plastered and you don't have to wait till the morning after to take the pill.
That's just a name.
It's okay, I took mine on the way over.
Have fun Max.
Do not have fun.
Bye!
(blows raspberry) I can handle a few sorority girls.
Let me make sure I still have Dmitri's number.
(gasps) Bunny!
Ashley!
Ashleigh!
(all screaming)
God, they're multiplying.
Oh, you look so good!
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up!
You guys should really listen to each other.
Couches in movie theaters?
I feel like Kate Middleton right now.
I'm glad you're easily impressed.
For Valentine's Day, I'll take you to the Super Target cafe.
Well I can't just sit on that kinda news.
Let me just call Max and tell her.
Nope, straight to her outgoing fart message.
Bon soir, everybody.
My name is Marcel, and I will be the curator for this evening's cinematic experience.
The film, which Owen Gleiberman has hailed, a Kubrickesque tour de force, will be screening in DCP...
Uh, yes?
A question from a fellow cinephile?
Do I have to order the seasoned fries separate from the regular ones or can I just get them mixed?
It's a dollar extra.
I'll be taking orders once the movie starts.
Whatever.
Hey, great question about the fries.
I had a follow up about free refills.
Everything okay?
I was just, um, checking this place on Yelp.
And to see if the dessert bar was on the news.
Or engulfed in flames.
Shh.
You saw the dancing hot dog.
No cell phones.
What are you guys doing here?
Did I cover my bed in "Dexter" tarp for nothing?
We're on a date.
Trying like crazy not to have sex.
Usually, when the lights go down in the movie, so do my pants.
And then, so do I.
And of course we would have to see a super sexy poster of Steve Buscemi in the lobby.
Hi, I'm Bobby.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry, I'm no Steve Buscemi.
I had braces in high school.
You guys brought Barbara on your date with you?
Of course not.
She's with the babysitter.
We used the carriage to sneak in our dinner.
Hey, we're not gonna pay movie chicken prices.
Oleg, tear me off a leg.
(ripping sound)
Good.
Yeah.
(siren wailing)
Was that a siren?
Oh, it's coming from the screen.
The movie's called "Sirens."
I know, but I thought I heard another one under it that sounded like it could be heading for a dessert bar.
Are you not having a good time?
Do you not like movies?
Please tell me you don't like plays.
No, I'm having a great time.
And please tell me you don't consider musicals plays.
Hey, I don't wanna check in on Max 'cause she'll think I don't trust her.
So can you check in on Max?
Because I really don't trust her.
Uh, I got chicken hands!
Why don't you ask your boyfriend to do it?
First, we haven't discussed labels yet.
And second, I don't want him to think I'm not having fun.
I'm having so much fun.
I would go to a musical if it was important to you
I'll do it.
Texting?
Out.
And don't come back until you gain some respect for the art form.
Who ordered the chili dog with the nachos on top?
Well it probably all for the best.
Since you're leaving anyways, you can check in on Max in person.
I guess.
Since we're about to chicken up your bed.
(together) Epsilon Phi until we die!
Epsilon Phi until we die!
Ah, heard you the first time.
I'm working on it.
(sighs)
Aw, come on, Ashley!
That's something I'd expect from Ashleigh.
Can you do something?
Uh, uhh.
Hey you, uh, they're trying to let a poor girl in the sorority.
Who?
Is she ugly?
There you go.
See?
She's as annoying as she was five minutes ago.
Now what do you people want?
Um, more shots.
Also, Ashleigh threw up in Ashley's purse.
Ah, back from the liquor store.
Sorry I took so long.
I didn't realize I was at a Pottery Barn.
Well, while I've got you confused,
How about you get back to work and bring out these drinks for me?
I am not confused.
I realized
I'm a waitress at this TGIFridays.
Congratulate us!
We've just gone two hours without having sex.
Which breaks our old record by pretty close to two hours.
You know, Caroline asked us to check up on you because she was worried.
We're not supposed to tell you that.
But I had to leave a half a roasted chicken in the movie theater.
So I am!
Does she have any idea what I've been through tonight with these sorority girls?
(chuckles) For all she knows, I'm sober.
Sorority girls, huh?
I was in a sorority once.
Until they found me.
What's going on?
We've been waiting for our next round of drinks for, like, ever.
Wow, Max.
Are you really gonna let the cast of "Pitch Perfect"
talk to you like that?
People in charge don't punch sorority girls.
People in charge don't punch sorority girls.
And can we get separate checks?
Or do they?
Separate checks?
(laughs)
Do I look like a mathologist to you?
Is that a problem?
'Cause I'd hate to have to say something on Yelp.
Yelp?
Caroline checks that more than she Googles herself.
Uh, not a problem at all.
Drinks and separate checks... (laughs) whatever that is...
coming right up!
Thanks!
You're the cutest.
No, you are.
Looks like someone's in the weeds and not just smoking it for a change.
Don't just kneel there, bring these drinks out.
I have to learn all of math in ten minutes.
All right, I'll stay.
But only because I want you to see how it feels when the shoe is on the...
Serve the damn drinks!
She gets it.
How long you been working at this Fridays, sonny?
Uh, is everything all right?
You've been to the bathroom nine times.
Are you a drug addict?
"Candy Crush" junkie?
We can deal with it together.
I'm sorry, Bobby, but you know how turtles can sense if their turtle best friend is stuck upside down on its shell, its turtle legs all wiggling in the air?
So it is drugs.
Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.
We went through that with my mom.
It's a killer.
We almost lost our house.
No, Max and I are the turtles.
And I can feel she's trapped on her back at the dessert bar.
All right, look, I don't know Max that well.
But I've gotten to know you a little bit and you have a really good, really beautiful head on your shoulders.
You trusted Max.
You should trust your own instincts.
You're right.
I do have a nice shaped head.
And I'm gonna stop worrying that she might
- burn the bar down.
- Good.
What?
Seriously?
I put a ton of work into that place.
(laughs)
You know what?
This movie sucks.
Let's get out of here and go get some dessert.
I know a great place.
That is so sweet.
And I was so worried you'd think I was crazy.
Oh, you're bananas.
But I like bananas.
Not the fruit.
The texture grosses me out.
But you.
I could kiss you for that.
You know, you actually could.
You're right, I can.
(siren wailing)
Yeah, we should get out of here.
(indistinct chatter)
Hello?
It's taking longer than it took me to almost graduate.
Just hang onto your hair extensions.
(gasps)
They're obvious?
My turtle sense was right.
Max is on her back and she's not under a boy turtle.
Maybe she's all right.
I don't smell fire and everyone's shoulders are still in their sockets.
Why are separate checks taking so long?
Can we please get our change?
Um, you put the apps on Bunny's bill, right?
'Cause she ate the most, as per ush.
Stop telling people I eat!
Stop telling people my LSAT scores.
Stop talking!
Now I have to start over.
I have a lot of numbers in my head and they're all angry.
I have to help her.
Separate checks?
Max calls 13 "ten three."
Caroline, wait.
Let her try and handle this on her own.
Otherwise, we'll never be able to go on a second date.
But she really nee...
There's gonna be a second date?
Okay, listen up, everybody!
Calm down!
Here's what we're gonna do instead of separate checks:
I'm not good at math, but I have been a negotiations expert for ten three years.
Ashley, you're gonna get $6 from Bunny's PayPal account and she's gonna do your nails.
Bunny, you're gonna Venmo Amber $20
And she's gonna let you borrow her gay friend Dave for your sister's wed.
Everybody good?
You've got ten three minutes to decide.
We're good.
Okay, problem solved.
Max, that was amazing.
I knew you could do that on your own.
No you didn't, you were spying on me.
Her turtle sense went off.
Is it strange that I'm a little sad that you don't need me?
I didn't say I don't need you, but you are a little sad.
Earl, it was a pleasure waiting tables at your side.
You and I have a chemistry you can't make in a lab.
You have a real strange way of talking to dudes.
(chuckles) Uh, hi.
Did you guys know there are two naked people eating chicken off each other in there?
What?
I haven't chicken-proofed those sinks.
All right, I'm closing my eyes and then I'm coming in.
Isn't he brave?
So did he bravely go where no man has gone before?
Under your sweater?
No, but we were smooching in the movie.
(gasps) Shut up!
- No, you shut up.
- No, really, shut your damn mouth, I'm exhausted.
(cash register dings)
Girls, prepare to be more obsolete than you already are.
Which will be hard.
You're one step above newspapers.
Behold, the future!
Oh, no.
I'm still here in the future?
Or, Han, your sister's here.
Hello, mola, Konichiwa.
I guess now's a good time to admit that I ate a bunch of shrooms and I'm seeing a robot in a bowtie.
This is a room service robot that delivers food.
My aunt's Holiday Inn went belly-up.
I got this and one night stand.
That's the only one night stand you're ever gonna get.
Must be a different kind of room service than they have at Tuggington's Hourly Motel.
Where the first tug is free.
R2, thank God.
I thought I lost you when we blew up the Death Star.
Would you like a late check out?
Sorry, toots.
I checked out years ago.
List diner specials.
You have ordered four adult films.
That's a lie.
I've only ordered three.
Shut down, robot.
Hey!
Hey!
This is what happens when you get a robot for free!
R2, no!
Yoda's our friend!
Somebody help me!
If that thing could show cleavage and steal silver wear,
I'd be out of a job.
I can't wait for our date either, Bobby.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
You hang up first.
No, you hang up...
Oh, he hung up.
I'm liking this guy more and more.
I know.
Isn't Bobby the cutest?
Not smoking Chinese baby cute, but not bad.
Max, I'm so excited.
This is the first date I'll be going on since Julia Roberts could still open a romantic comedy.
I'm still pissed at them for stealing my life story for "Pretty Woman."
Jason Alexander's character was totally me.
For our date, he's thinking of taking me on an afternoon picnic in the park.
The pretty one, where you crotch punched that mime into a pond.
You know the fact that Bobby's taking you on a day date is a bad sign, right?
It probably means he's married.
Or worse, afraid of the dark.
Actually, the day date was my idea.
You know we're not married, right?
That's not why I call you my old lady.
It's cause you write thank you notes and use the word jeepers.
Jeepers, Max!
I just figured if I go out at night, you'll have to run the dessert bar alone and you've never done that before.
I've also never flossed my back teeth.
And they're fine when it's not windy.
I got this.
Hey, girls.
I just thought I'd take a walk and stretch my knees.
Then I remembered I don't have any.
Earl, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max will be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Ooh, speaking of disasters, that reminds me,
I have to return "Risky Business" to Blockbuster.
When do they close?
2009.
So I still have time.
Hey, guys, look.
It's a groundhog.
So it's gonna be an early spring.
No.
He saw his shadow this year.
Know your facts.
Earl, you're supposed to be in the diner.
I had to ask our shrimp supplier to cover for you.
I thought your mother was our shrimp supplier.
Han, I'm going on a night date, like a person.
Max'll be running the dessert bar and that'll be fine, right?
Sure, like when I had her run the diner by herself.
Which never happened because I'm not a damn fool!
Let's go, Earl.
All right, fine.
I left my knees there, anyway.
Hey, I was, uh...
I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd hop on two subways and a Citi Bike and come say hi.
A Citi Bike?
Oh, this city gal is flattered.
Jeepers.
Isn't he the cutest?
Oh, not dog running in his sleep cute, but I'm all right.
Bobby, I have some good news.
I don't want you to think I'm loose or fast or whatever the kids say, but I am available for a night date, like a person.
Hey, really?
That's great.
I usually save my day dates for my grandma.
She likes a noon dinner.
- I like a noon...

I have to learn all of math in ten minutes.
All right, I'll stay.
But only because I want you to see how it feels when the shoe is on the...
Serve the damn drinks!
She gets it.
How long you been working at this Fridays, sonny?
Uh, is everything all right?
You've been to the bathroom nine times.
Are you a drug addict?
"Candy Crush" junkie?
We can deal with it together.
I'm sorry, Bobby, but you know how turtles can sense if their turtle best friend is stuck upside down on its shell, its turtle legs all wiggling in the air?
So it is drugs.
Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.
We went through that with my mom.
It's a killer.
We almost lost our house.
No, Max and I are the turtles.
And I can feel she's trapped on her back at the dessert bar.
All right, look, I don't know Max that well.
But I've gotten to know you a little bit and you have a really good, really beautiful head on your shoulders.
You trusted Max.
You should trust your own instincts.
You're right.
I do have a nice shaped head.
And I'm gonna stop worrying that she might
- burn the bar down.
- Good.
What?
Seriously?
I put a ton of work into that place.
You know what?
This movie sucks.
Let's get out of here and go get some dessert.
I know a great place.
That is so sweet.
And I was so worried you'd think I was crazy.
Oh, you're bananas.
But I like bananas.
Not the fruit.
The texture grosses me out.
But you.
I could kiss you for that.
You know, you actually could.
You're right, I can.
Yeah, we should get out of here.
Hello?
It's taking longer than it took me to almost graduate.
Just hang onto your hair extensions.
They're obvious?
My turtle sense was right.
Max is on her back and she's not under a boy turtle.
Maybe she's all right.
I don't smell fire and everyone's shoulders are still in their sockets.
Why are separate checks taking so long?
Can we please get our change?
Um, you put the apps on Bunny's bill, right?
'Cause she ate the most, as per ush.
Stop telling people I eat!
Stop telling people my LSAT scores.
Stop talking!
Now I have to start over.
I have a lot of numbers in my head and they're all angry.
I have to help her.
Separate checks?
Max calls 13 "ten three."
Caroline, wait.
Let her try and handle this on her own.
Otherwise, we'll never be able to go on a second date.
But she really nee...
There's gonna be a second date?
Okay, listen up, everybody!
Calm down!
Here's what we're gonna do instead of separate checks:
I'm not good at math, but I have been a negotiations expert for ten three years.
Ashley, you're gonna get $6 from Bunny's PayPal account and she's gonna do your nails.
Bunny, you're gonna Venmo Amber $20
And she's gonna let you borrow her gay friend Dave for your sister's wed.
Everybody good?
You've got ten three minutes to decide.
We're good.
Okay, problem solved.
Max, that was amazing.
I knew you could do that on your own.
No you didn't, you were spying on me.
Her turtle sense went off.
Is it strange that I'm a little sad that you don't need me?
I didn't say I don't need you, but you are a little sad.
Earl, it was a pleasure waiting tables at your side.
You and I have a chemistry you can't make in a lab.
You have a real strange way of talking to dudes.
Uh, hi.
Did you guys know there are two naked people eating chicken off each other in there?
What?
I haven't chicken-proofed those sinks.
All right, I'm closing my eyes and then I'm coming in.
Isn't he brave?
So did he bravely go where no man has gone before?
Under your sweater?
No, but we were smooching in the movie.
Shut up!
- No, you shut up.
- No, really, shut your damn mouth, I'm exhausted.
Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
- No!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
Listen.
His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
Yeah.
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
That Sunday, when the preacher called... ♪ What can wash away my sin?
♪
He knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus ♪
♪ What can make me whole again?
♪
- ♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus ♪
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Louder!
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪
♪ Lord God Almighty ♪
♪ Early in the morning ♪
♪ Our song shall rise to Thee ♪
♪ Holy, holy, holy... ♪
Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- Hmm?
- Dad, catch.
There's no room.
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
- Cheese?
- Okay.
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
What did she look like?
Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
Careful near the water.
Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.

Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Daddy!
Look at me!
- Stop!
- Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
- Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
- I can't get him!
- Need help?
He okay?
- He's got him.
Come on, Dad!
Hang on.
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
Hey.
- Come on, Josh.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
Come on, Josh!
There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the Imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.
Shh...
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
- They tipped over the boat.
- Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Shh...
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
- You're okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- We gotta go.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, Mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
- What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
- No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack...
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
You're not thinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some Papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
No.
I told you.
Mackenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
- It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
Watch this one.
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Night, Mack!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
♪ Your heart ♪
♪ Try to be sure ♪
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So... you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Daddy!
Daddy!
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
- What?
- You heard me.
This is...
That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
- I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him?
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
What about this boy?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might. 'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy...
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
- How was it?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Here we are.
This is it?
To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
What are those?
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's bring Missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I love you, Mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
- Mack?
- Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
♪ He reigns from Heaven above ♪
♪ With wisdom, power, and love ♪
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
He loves larger than most...
He's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
- No!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
Listen.
His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
Yeah.
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
That Sunday, when the preacher called... ♪ What can wash away my sin?
♪
He knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus a'
♪ What can make me whole again?
a'
- a' Nothing but the blood of Jesus S'
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
'
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Loudefl.
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪
♪ Lord God Almighty I
♪ Early in the morning A'
♪ Our song shall rise to Thee a'
♪ Holy, holy, holy...
A'
Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- Hmm?
- Dad, catch.
There's no room.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
- Cheese?
- Okay.
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
What did she look like?
Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His hear':
Broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
Careful near the water.
Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.

You have a nice family.
Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papauv?"
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die'?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
- Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
- I can't get him!
- Need help?
He okay?
- He's got him.
Come on, Dad!
Hang on.
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
- Come on, Josh.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
Come on, Josh!
There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the lmnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.
Shh...
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
- They tipped over the boat.
- Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Shh...
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
- You're okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- We gotta go.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, Mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
- What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it'?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
' Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I g0?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
- No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack...
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it'?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God'?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
You're not thinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
Wwmm I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some Papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
NQ_
I told you.
Mackenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're... lam.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
- It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We, urn...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Watch this one.
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right'?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Night, Mack!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
♪ Your heart A'
♪ Try to be sure I
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My What?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will everjustify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out'?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So... you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Daddy!
Daddy!
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
- What?
- You heard me.
This is...
That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
- I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right'?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him?
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
"You're not comm"?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going-."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
What about this boy'?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy...
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
- How was it'?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me'?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Here we are.
This is it?
To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
What are those?
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
Wwmm I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya'?
Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I forgive...
I forgive you.
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it Will.
Let's go.
Let's bring Missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I love you, Mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
- Mack'?
- Rest.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey, Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy-
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're g0in' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
♪ He reigns from Heaven above I
♪ With wisdom, power, and love S'
♪ Our God is an awesome God A'
I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 1O bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
He loves larger than most...
He's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
- No!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
Listen.
His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
Yeah.
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
That Sunday, when the preacher called...
# What can wash away my sin?
# ...he knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
# Nothing but the blood of Jesus #
# What can make me whole again?
#
- # Nothing but the blood of Jesus #
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Louder!
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
# Holy, holy, holy #
# Lord God Almighty #
# Early in the morning #
# Our song shall rise to Thee #
# Holy, holy, holy... #
Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- Hmm?
- Dad, catch.
There's no room.
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
- Cheese?
- Okay.
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
What did she look like?
Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
Careful near the water.
Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.
- # The other day # - # The other day #
- # I saw a bear # - # I saw a bear #
- # A way up there # - # A way up there #
# The other day I saw a bear #
# A great big bear way up there #
- # He looked at me # - # He looked at me #
- # I looked at him # - # I looked at him #
- # He sized up me # - # He sized up me #
You have a nice family.
Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Daddy!
Look at me!
- Stop!
- Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
- Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
- I can't get him!
- Need help?
He okay?
- He's got him.
Come on, Dad!
Hang on.
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
Hey.
- Come on, Josh.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
Come on, Josh!
There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the Imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.
Shh...
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
- They tipped over the boat.
- Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Shh...
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
- You're okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- We gotta go.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, Mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
- What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
- No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack...
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
You're not thinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some Papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
No.
I told you.
Mackenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
- It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
Watch this one.
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Night, Mack!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
# Your heart #
# Try to be sure #
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So... you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Daddy!
Daddy!
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
- What?
- You heard me.
This is...
That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
- I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him?
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
What about this boy?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might. 'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy...
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
- How was it?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Here we are.
This is it?
To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
What are those?
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's bring Missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I love you, Mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
- Mack?
- Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
# Our God is an awesome God #
# He reigns from Heaven above #
# With wisdom, power, and love #
# Our God is an awesome God #
I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
He loves larger than most... he's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
Who would have no doubts
When a man says he has passed
A whole weekend with God?
In a cabin, no less.
And it was not any cabin.
This was "the cabin".
What I'm about to tell is a little...
It's more like fantastic.
But it does not mean it's not true.
"PHILLIPS FAMILY"
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy, an Irish-American family,
Delivered to heavy work and strict rules.
No!
Look at me!
Look at me!
You're hurting me!
Listen!
His father was from the Presbyterian church.
What are you looking at, boy?
I drank in hiding.
Leave him alone.
Especially when the rain did not come,
Or came too soon...
IT IS...
Most often, between one and the other.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie from the oven.
Come and eat a slice.
No thank you.
It was not a question.
Here it is.
Thank you.
Look at me, dear.
Parents should not do this to their children.
It is not love.
Understood?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He is always listening.
Sing with me
And whoever feels like it, come to the altar.
That Sunday, when the pastor called...
He knew he could not remain silent.
Forgive me.
It's all right.
Just tell Him you're sorry.
I can not get him to stop.
I try, but when he drinks,
He hits my mother.
I try to protect her, but I can not!
Why do you force me to do that, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of everyone?
Say it.
Say it!
"Obey your fathers, for this pleases the Lord!"
Higher!
Colossians 3:20.
"Obey your fathers, for this pleases the Lord!"
The spanking lasted all night.
What happened next, Mack does not like to comment.
"I HOPE THAT ONE DAY MAY FORGIVE ME".
Let's say that pain can test us from the inside.
And force us to do the unthinkable.
"STRICNINE"
Thirteen is too early to become an adult.
The secrets we keep
They crawl to the surface.
Are you alright.
Mack and Nan were married 18 years ago,
And most of the time they were happy.
She is the glue that keeps the family together.
If we leave in 3 minutes, we can be on time.
Children?
Missy, be quiet, stop!
Josh!
Never mind.
Josh!
Jo...
Is ready?
Yes, why?
Ho...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
He combed and smelled.
You want to seduce Ally Taylor.
I do not want!
Yes, yes!
Who's Ally?
I do not care who it is,
If she helps us get there, it's approved.
If God is always with us,
Why do you care if we're late for church?
Makes sense.
Right.
God cares because Mom cares.
Alright, let's go!
Nice try, you rascal.
Good Morning.
Hi guys.
Hi.
Mack, did you see the game yesterday?
Since when do I get the control?
I heard that one day they give it back.
The worst part is I'm enjoying her shows.
I met Mack at church ten years ago.
At that time, he did not know God
As Nan knew.
If his relationship with God was vast,
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa"
And spoke with Him as an old friend.
Something that was difficult for Mack to accept.
But together they managed to create
Which most would call a good life.
But all this changed in an instant,
When the great sadness came uninvited.
THECABANA
No, you can not drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I've never seen anything like it.
Of course I'll be fine.
I'll warm the rice on that thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
He was going to clean the entrance before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yes you too.
I have not seen such a storm in 30 years.
Good thing Nan and the kids are off the road.
Want some help there?
I take my shovel.
I'll find a way quick.
I am fine.
It should not take that long.
Thanks for the fuel.
How about dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pie.
No, Nan left food in the refrigerator.
Maybe next time.
It's all right.
Thank you.
It's all right.
"IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME.
MISS YOU".
"I'LL BE IN THE CABANA AT THE END OF THE WEEK"
"IF YOU WANT TO TALK.
POPE "
Hey, Dad.
Father?
Father, take it.
There is no room.
Maybe you wanna put it where you can find it.
First aid.
For bee sting we'll use mud, right, Josh?
Yes.
Mother, can not you even leave your seminary?
Come on, you guys are gonna have fun!
I have faith in your father's maternal abilities.
Has?
Hey, young lady, what have you got there?
My collection of insects.
Your what?
Are you carrying insects?
No, Daddy.
No?
These are Dixie and Donna, carpet beetles.
Wanda, the bug.
And this is Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." Liked it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can not leave Carl, the caterpillar.
It's not a good idea.
Do not.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Last summer spree?
It will be a lonely weekend here.
I'll bring you a 3kg fish.
Right.
Do not buy in the market, I know the difference.
Willie, do you have a second?
Of course.
Nice.
We have to go.
A little patience, please.
Children?
It's all right.
Let's go.
Say "xis".
It's all right.
A beautiful group.
All right, go.
Goodbye!
Kids, look at that.
Remember?
The waterfalls.
Dad, we have to stop!
Let's see the waterfall.
No stops.
We have to get there before nightfall.
Have you told Missy the story of the Indian Princess?
Which Princess?
Come on, Dad, you gotta tell.
Tell her.
We have to go back!
Please!
We can not go back.
We can not stop at all exits.
The answer is no".
Long ago, there was an Indian Princess.
What was she like?
Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
That color.
You want me to tell you the story?
It's all right.
Well, this princess.
Was the oldest daughter of the older chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Until one summer,
A terrible disease spread through the earth.
It was so fierce that even the strongest warriors
Became ill.
They were on the verge of death.
Then the chiefs gathered to see what they could do.
The Princess's father spoke of a prophecy.
The disease would only be detained if the daughter of a cacique
Of his life for the life of his people.
After a long discussion,
They knew they could not ask for such a sacrifice.
And the Princess, when she heard about this prophecy,
She knew what she had to do,
Because she loved her people very much.
One morning, she climbed those rocks.
And without hesitation,
She jumped.
The next morning,
A great cure came to the whole tribe.
The patients got out of bed.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the cacique knew that his daughter had disappeared.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
He cried, asked for the sacrifice of his daughter to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears
Who answered your prayers.
The water began to fall.
Right there.
And that's how the Multnomah waterfall was created.
Ready to go?
I go ahead.
A little patience, please.
You inherited this from your mother, did not you?
"LAKE WALLOWA STATE PARK"
Careful near the water.
All right, Father, of course.
Let me help with that.
Ready.
My name is Mack.
Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
Are those two yours?
Yes they are.
They seem to be getting along.
I think we should either, or it will get weird.
Listen, we're camping there if you want to come in later,
Roasting marshmallows at the campfire.
Is a good idea.
Great!
See you.
One of these days, one of these days.
I saw a bear I saw a bear
Upstairs Upstairs
One of these days I saw a bear
A huge bear up there
He looked at me He looked at me
I looked at him I looked at him
He told me He told me
You have a good family.
Thank you, you too.
Dad, you need to come and pray to the Pope.
I'm on my way.
"Pope"?
It's just like my wife nicknamed God.
I like that.
It's very intimate for my taste, but...
Children love.
Dad!
I'll be right back.
Do you know what my mother used to tell me?
She said that when a star flashes,
A prayer is heard in heaven.
Papa is very busy.
Yes.
Why did she have to die?
Who?
The Indigenous Princess.
I do not think she had to die.
I think she chose to die.
What she did saved her people.
Has this story happened?
It could have happened.
Sometimes legends are born of true stories.
But the death of Jesus is not a legend.
It's in the Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Pope?
He is a spirit.
And it's great.
It's ok?
So why is it so cruel?
Why did you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off a cliff
And made Jesus die on the cross.
Do not you find that cruel?
Let me tell you something.
When we get home,
Your mother will have a good answer for you.
Dad, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
Do not.
No darling.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to jump?
Do not.
He would not ask for that.
It's all right.
Good night, daddy.
Good evening.
She asks good questions, does not she?
Yes, it certainly does.
She's a special girl.
You two are.
Thanks.
I love you daddy.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time to sort things out.
Do you think the Princess should have red or blue boots?
Time to get in!
Dad, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
A red dress like mine.
Then red.
It's beautiful, my dear.
Dad!
Look at me!
Stop it!
Dad!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He is arrested!
I can not get it!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck, Daddy!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
Are you alright?
I can not get it!
Need help?
He took it.
Come on, Dad!
Hold tight.
C'mon C'mon.
There he is.
Come on, Josh.
C'mon C'mon.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Let's go!
Come on, son.
Come on, Josh!
That's it!
That's right.
Very well.
Missy!
You can leave, dear.
Everyone is well.
Emil, did you see Missy?
No.
Did you look at the camp?
You must be with my daughters.
Are you alright?
Where is she, Daddy?
Somewhere here.
Let's find her, right?
Is not here.
My daughters are gone, too.
Look at those bathrooms and showers.
That I will look at these.
It's all right.
Missy!
Emily!
Excuse me, did you see a little girl?
I did not see anyone.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found the girls.
Where is Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they did not see her.
Missy!
My God!
Missy!
God!
Please God!
We need to know if there is anything different from what you remember.
Anything out of place.
Said she was there.
Yes.
What is that?
That ladybug, that brooch.
Not from Missy?
Do not.
Definitely not.
Must be one of those places.
The lake or the mountain.
Yeah.
Let me check that out.
Yes.
Can someone tell me what's going on?
I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Everything indicates that there is a guy who has been looking for years.
They think he's responsible for the kidnapping
Of at least 5 girls.
You think he got my Missy?
We still do not know anything.
We're seeing a possible suspect.
Man in a pickup truck near the Imnaha Lock.
The FBI is moving in with Joseph.
Exchange.
Tell him we'll be there in an hour.
Mr. Phillips...
Go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there's no one in this room.
That you do not care about your Missy.
We are doing everything to bring it safely.
Mother!
It's all right.
I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
I'm here.
I'm sorry.
Hi.
I took my eyes off her just for a second.
They turned the boat.
I know.
Mack.
Honey, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Teams found the truck in the mountains.
It's ok.
The helicopter is waiting, sir.
Mack, are you okay?
It's ok?
I am fine.
Right.
We have to go.
Right.
Hi, Mack.
Let's have dinner now.
What the hell is this?
What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You...
You think I wrote that?
Mention the cabin.
Signed by "Pope".
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never play with this.
Where did you get that?
In my mailbox.
Someone put it there.
Who would get so low?
Shall we call the police?
Call the police?
And say what?
"A letter appeared in the mail, with no trace in the snow
And it may have been signed by God? "
Were there no traces?
Forget.
Mack...
Mack!
We come back!
Hi!
We're at home!
Hi Dad.
Hi, champ.
All right?
Yes, I slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's ok.
Just a little cock.
What is it?
Just a work thing.
Where's Kate?
She's coming in now.
I tried calling this morning.
You tried?
I must have erased it myself.
Hey, Dad.
Father?
Can I finish my duty at Ally's?
You saw the weather, right?
It's only two streets away.
Another time.
Hey, you.
Hi.
What is it?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
I can go?
Yes.
How was she there at Arlene?
As always.
She comes out of the shell for a minute.
And then back.
I'll take it to my brother this weekend.
He knows a therapist we could try, and...
I thought maybe you could go along.
I'm sure that's the last thing she wants.
I think you'd better go.
I have to change and...
Solve some things in the city.
Mack.
Yes?
Do not forget that we love each other.
And you do not know anything about it?
Well, it has no seal.
Do not.
If it has no seal, it has not been delivered.
Do you want your mail, since you're here?
What do you need a truck for?
Mack.
Which is.
We've been friends for a long time, be honest with me.
Is it because of that note?
You're not thinking of going back there, are you?
Good...
Have you talked to Nan about this?
No, I do not want to upset her.
She's barely holding the ends.
Have you prayed for this?
I just want your truck.
But you know that's not a good idea, right?
And if it's that guy
And he's trying to get you there
Who knows what?
We don `t know yet.
Have you considered the other possibility?
What?
Do you think it's God?
It was you who said there was no trail in the snow.
Maybe I was already there and I had not seen it before.
Do not know.
It's total madness.
But I have to do something.
That's all I have.
Right.
But I will go with you.
It's all right.
I hope everything goes well for her.
I hope everything goes well for you too.
Honey, can you take this?
Of course.
Thanks.
Tell me when you arrive?
Look that...
I know you're fighting something.
It's okay if you do not know how to talk about it.
But we've lost so much already.
I do not want to lose you too.
All right?
Tent, backpacks, food,
Lantern, snow boots.
Just in case.
Where's your stick?
I did not know we were going to fish.
We will need to do something,
When we find out that I went crazy.
It's all right.
I'll get my things.
You're not planning on coming back, are you?
I do not want to lose you too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come here.
You did not even let us have a decent funeral.
You coward.
Because?
God!
God!
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
You led me here.
Now he does not have the courage to appear.
What a great Pope you are.
It's cold out here, is not it?
I have a fireplace at home if you want to warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know a person who would love to see you.
Do not.
I told you.
MacKenzie Allen Phillips.
Well well well.
Look at you.
I know you?
Not very well.
But we can sort this out.
I've been waiting so long for this.
To finally see you face to face.
Can I get your coat?
And the gun.
We do not want anyone to get hurt, do we?
I know this is confusing.
We all understand.
It will process this in its terms and time.
How about presentations?
I'm Elousia.
I have many names,
But this is one of my favorites.
Or you can call me like Nan calls.
Do you know Nan?
Yes, very good.
You're saying it's...
I am.
The "I am"?
I am what I am.
Look, I'm already quoting the scripture.
You knew my son.
Good to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
I'm Sarayu.
Sara who?
Sarayu.
It means "wind blow".
Right.
So...
Which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
All right, dear.
Lets roll.
We all collect things that we value, do not we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet them.
I'll be right back.
Why did I have to wake up?
I think you dropped that.
You wrote this?
We are so happy to have accepted our invitation.
This is crazy.
What am I doing here?
What should I do?
You must do nothing.
You are free to do what you want.
You can go fishing.
Or take a walk.
You can help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know it's too much to process, but...
You'll be fine, Mack.
I'll be finishing a project in the barn.
If you want to go there.
It's all right.
Remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
The perfume of his mother.
She loves you more than she could know.
I died?
Do you feel dead?
You knew I'd come, did not you?
Of course yes.
Was I free not to come?
I have no interest in prisoners.
You're free to leave now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because...
It was here that we had a blockade.
She's wearing a dress.
How is it?
I always...
I imagined you
With white beard.
This is Santa Claus.
After what happened, I did not think I could
Deal with a parent now.
On here.
Be useful.
Knead.
Fold.
Turn.
That's it.
I know there's...
A great chasm between us, Mack.
You may not believe...
But I have a special affection for you.
I want to heal this wound...
That grows in you and between us.
There is no easy answer to end your pain.
No solution that lasts forever.
Life takes a little time
And a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
You're God Almighty, are not you?
You know everything.
It is everywhere, at the same time.
And it has infinite power.
And somehow...
Let my daughter die.
When she most needed you...
You abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed it?
Son...
When all you see is your pain,
Forget me
Stop with these charades.
How can you say that you will help me?
When you could not help her?
For your cause... she's gone.
If you can not change that,
I will never be free.
Truth sets you free, MacKenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He is now in the hut, covered with sawdust.
"Truth"?
I know that story.
You left him too.
It seems that you have the terrible habit
To turn away from those who say they love.
I'm not who you think.
He said that himself.
"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
He did not understand the mystery.
Never think that choosing my child
Did not have a high price for us.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him.
I never left you.
I never left Missy.
He's beautiful, is not he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand,
Was created to be loved.
Living without love is like...
Take away the wings of a bird.
Pain does this to us.
If left unresolved,
Can forget for what was created.
It's not what I want for you.
That's why you're here, MacKenzie.
This is your flying class.
Dinner is almost ready.
Does Josh have a girlfriend?
You mean Ally?
I like her.
Me too.
I'm a fan of her laughter.
Its cute.
IT IS.
He still does not believe this is real.
You think?
How's Kate?
We...
We were close, but...
My God!
Sorry, I did not mean to...
Not alright.
I did it.
That's good.
The best meal I ever had.
In life.
Dreaming or not.
Thanks.
Let me ask you something.
I told you all about Josh, Kate, and Nan.
But if you are real...
Then you already know everything I will say.
Even before I say it, right?
Yes.
But we choose to hear everything you have to say,
As if it were the first time.
We love to know your children through your eyes.
I wash and you dry?
I'll take care of it.
Why do not you show Mack your job?
Want to take a look?
It's all right.
Look at this one.
Amazing.
I understand that you are all connected.
But I feel more relaxed with you.
Probably because I'm human.
But you're God too, right?
I'm the best way for a human
To relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You are all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected.
And Sarayu, my God.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love was meant to exist in a relationship, Mack.
That's all we want to have with you.
Even if you can not see.
You are at the center of our love and purpose.
Even if all this is very beautiful,
It's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time I looked at the stars like now,
She was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Good evening, Mack!
Dad!
Dad!
Missy!
Dad!
Dad!
Good morning, Mack.
Do you like Neil Young?
I have a special affection for him.
How did you sleep, dear?
Good.
You know...
Dreams are important.
They can be a way to open a window.
To let the bad air out.
Is there someone you do not have a special affection for?
Do not.
I have not found anyone yet.
I think it's my way.
Are not you mad at them?
Of course yes.
But what father is not?
That's where your anger comes from, right?
My what?
His wrath.
I'm lost.
Drop it.
Everyone knows that you punish people who disappoint you.
Do not.
I do not need to punish people.
Sin is punishment itself.
Even if it is difficult for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you consider a mess,
Working for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world,
What kind of good thing
Can it come from a little girl being murdered by a monster?
You may not cause these things,
But it certainly does not stop them.
MacKenzie, you're trying to find feeling in your world.
Based on a very incomplete image.
It's like looking through the heart of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life
Is that you do not think I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and knew how much I love you,
So even when you did not understand,
You would know that I am working in your life for good.
And then you'd trust me.
Trust in you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say
Which will justify what happened to her.
Looking for output?
If you are looking for your car, go there.
Just after the trees.
You may need this.
Thank you.
Just to clarify, we're not trying to justify anything.
We would like to heal you if you let us.
Before you go,
There's something in the garden that I expected.
That you could help me.
Before the celebration tomorrow.
What celebration?
If you want to know, you'll stay here.
Well, that's wild.
This is not the word in your head.
All right, this is a mess.
And it's not?
So beautiful.
There is something very special that I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the soil,
We have to dig up all the roots,
Or they will return and undermine the new growth.
But that's beautiful.
You can start there.
It's all right.
Caution.
This one is deadly.
What are you doing here if it's poisonous?
You are presuming that poison is a bad thing.
Alone,
The sap of that branch would kill you.
But combined with the nectar of this flower,
Will suddenly contain incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how much you trust
In your ability to discern good from evil?
It's usually obvious.
And what is it based on to know what is good?
Well, if you help me...
Or help those I love.
And evil?
It is harmful.
It hurts someone I like.
So, basically, you're the judge?
I think so.
Have you been wrong?
Or did you change your mind after a while?
Of course.
And there are billions like you...
Each one establishing what he thinks
Be good and evil.
And when his good is in conflict with the evil of the neighbor,
Discussions arise.
Wars explode.
Because everyone insists on playing God.
You should not do any of this.
All on their own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So...
Decided to stay.
I'm thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, right?
If you're smart enough to understand what she says.
So if you are willing to walk,
There's something on the other side of the lake.
Which I would like to show.
I just have to end up in the shed,
And meet you there.
You can take the boat if you want.
I left the oar there, if you think you can.
Dad!
Do not.
Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this?
It's not me.
You told me to come here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting him consume it, but you do not have to.
Do not.
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Do not look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Do not think about the past.
Do not think about pain.
Look at me.
Everything will be fine.
Look at me!
Believe me, none of this will hurt you.
Keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you off that boat.
What?
Did you hear me.
That's not funny.
I am not kidding.
You can.
I can not.
Not on their own.
I'm going to sink.
No, Mack.
You are imagining a future without me,
And this future does not exist.
I promise to always be with you, okay?
And I'm right here.
Let's go.
It's all right.
That's right.
This is crazy.
And now?
We started walking.
Is right.
Good.
How is it going?
I'm still freaking out.
It looks like we have company.
Look at that.
Look him!
What a beauty!
Must be about six inches.
I've been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why do not you order him to bite the bait?
What would be the grace?
You know, you really do not fit
In the religious things they taught me.
Religion.
Religion is a lot of work.
I do not want slaves.
I want friends, families, to share life.
What about following rules
And work to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call...
Of a Christian, am I?
I do not think so.
I do not care what they call me.
I just want people to change because they know Papa.
To feel what it is to be truly loved.
I do not think I've ever felt this.
Put your shoes on.
I'll show you how.
Go straight to the end of the path, and then... continues.
Will not you come with me?
This is a path that only you can follow.
I thought you said you'd never leave me.
And I meant it.
Trust me.
Do not forget what you have learned.
I'll be waiting for you, right here.
Continues.
Hello?
Someone?
Sorry I...
Who are you?
I am the Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm starting to get used to it.
Today is an important day, with important consequences.
You're here for a trial.
Judgment?
They said I was not dead.
Is not.
So what is this?
Do not you believe that God is good?
Missy is His daughter?
Of course.
Then no.
I do not think God loves his children well.
If that's what you believe in...
Come here.
Sit down.
You can judge me from there.
Judge you?
Do you have anything to confess?
You know what I did.
Yes, but you are not being judged.
Today, you are the judge.
What?
Why are you surprised?
You spent your life judging everything and everyone,
Actions and motivations.
Like you only knew them.
You make shallow judgments,
Just because of someone's color.
By the clothes.
By body language.
Because of this,
You have experience, MacKenzie.
Sit down.
Right.
Who should I judge?
There must be at least some guilty about all the pain
And suffering in the world, right?
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
The ones that hurt others?
Assassins?
Dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yes.
What about the men who attack their wives?
Come back here.
What did you say?
Or parents who discount their own suffering in their children?
Let's not do that.
Should that man be judged?
Yes.
You'll keep your mouth shut!
What about this kid?
What about him?
Would you judge him?
Is a child.
But you have already judged it.
The boy is your father.
Yes sir.
Now,
What about the man who abuses innocent little girls?
Dad!
Dad!
Okay, that's enough.
Is this man guilty?
I would condemn him to Hell.
And his father?
The man who turned him into this depraved monster.
I would condemn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Does not the pain come from long before Adam?
What about God?
Is not he guilty?
He allowed it all.
Especially if he knew what would happen.
You want me to say that?
Absolutely!
God is guilty.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God...
You must choose one of your children,
To spend eternity in Heaven.
The other will go to Hell.
I can not...
Can not what?
I'm just asking you to do something that you believe God does.
So, who will go to Hell?
You can choose Kate.
She said some very painful things.
She pulled you away.
You're not even sure if she still loves you.
Or, you can choose Josh.
He has been disobedient.
He ran away, lied to you.
Did not you know that?
MacKenzie, make your choice.
I do not want to do this anymore.
I can not do this.
Can not do what?
I can not.
I will not.
You should do.
This is not a game.
You have to do this.
Wants to know?
That's not fair.
You should do this.
Is not fair.
I can not.
Take me.
I go in their place.
I stand in their place.
You will take me.
I go in their place.
Leave my children alone and take me.
MacKenzie,
You have judged that your children are worthy of love,
Even if it costs you everything.
You now know the heart of the Pope.
You know, I do not understand
How can God love Missy?
And make her go through so much bad.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use it to punish me?
Because this is not fair.
And she did not deserve it.
My wife and my kids did not deserve it.
Maybe I deserve it, I know I...
Is that your God, MacKenzie?
No wonder he's drowning in sorrow.
God is not like that.
It was not God who did this.
He did not stop it.
It does not stop many things that cause pain.
What happened to Missy was a work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune to this.
You want the promise of a life without pain.
I want.
Yes.
Does not exist.
As long as there is another will in this universe,
Who does not follow God,
The evil has a door of entrance.
There has to be a better way.
And has.
But the best way involves trust.
I do not want to be the judge anymore.
Missy.
She can not hear you.
Can she see me?
Do not.
But she knows she's here.
She is fine?
More than you think.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
Whereby?
I could not save her, I did not make it in time.
Missy does not think so.
Not Nan, not Papa.
It's time to leave it behind.
How was it?
Terrible.
It is wonderful.
I'm proud of you, my friend.
Thank you for letting me see you.
It was not my idea.
It always works best when we do it together, do not you think?
Does God have time to sunbathe?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doing right now.
Papa...
Yes, MacKenzie?
I caught you heavy.
Excuse me.
I did not know.
It's all right.
It's in the past, that's where it should stay.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
I would like this.
Thanks for letting me see Missy.
The pleasure was all mine.
I can not describe
The joy I felt when I saw you two together.
And Missy is a special girl.
Certainly.
Now you understand.
I can take a lot of good things
Of great tragedies.
But that does not mean that I cause the tragedies.
After all I felt for you,
Why continue working with me?
That's what love does.
I do not quite understand relationships, do you?
But you still love me.
Men.
Sometimes they're such idiots.
Did I hear God calling me an idiot?
If the hood serves, yes, sir.
If the hood serves.
Take a shower, Mack.
We'll have a great night.
Will somebody tell me where we're going?
Look around, MacKenzie.
Do not forget to enjoy the trip.
Here we are.
It is?
For your eyes.
Just for today,
We would love him to see what we have seen.
It's ok.
What is that?
It is not "what".
And who".
Children of the Pope of all languages, tribes and nations.
What you call personality and emotion,
We see it as color and light.
What's going on with that one?
Why is it coming to us?
It's coming to you.
IT IS...
Father.
Mack, I'm sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, I could not see you.
I could not see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was afraid.
I did not know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You became the father that I could not be.
I'm very proud of you.
Can you forgive me?
See you, son.
Let's go home.
Mack, wake up.
It's time to go.
Papa?
Good morning son.
You're messing with me, are not you?
Ever.
You're going to need a father for what you have to do today.
Where will we go?
We are almost there.
We're here to do something.
That will be very painful for you.
Please do not.
Son,
We are in the process of healing to conclude
That part of your journey.
Do you want me to forgive you?
Yes.
He killed my daughter.
I want to hurt him.
I want him to suffer...
How he made me suffer.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he is my son too, and I want to redeem him.
Redeem it?
He should burn in Hell.
So you wanted to be the judge again?
Are you going to let him get safe?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything has consequences.
What did he do...
It was horrible.
I'm not asking you to justify what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right.
And that I know what's best.
And then?
Forgiveness does not establish a relationship.
It's just relieving the lump in the throat.
Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.
It is stealing your joy.
And deforming their ability to love.
I can not.
You are not arrested because you can not,
He's stuck because he will not forgive.
You do not have to do it yourself.
I'm here with you.
I do not know how to forgive.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
MacKenzie, you're a blessing.
I'm still angry.
Of course it is.
No one gets over it.
Maybe I have to forgive a thousand times
Until it gets easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's take Missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please!
It is very good for the body to let the tears flow.
It's your tears, MacKenzie.
We've been collecting them for quite some time.
Here it is.
Thank you.
MacKenzie, we have something to talk about.
You can stay here with us,
Or go home to Nan and her children.
Anyway, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you leave, you'll leave her behind.
But only for now.
What does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there is no impatience,
So she does not mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so extraordinary.
Going home, going to work,
Try to be a good person.
To love my family.
Do not know.
What do I really care about?
Completely.
Mack, you're important, just like everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or you forgive...
In every act of kindness,
The universe changes for the better.
If something matters, then everything matters.
So I want to go home.
Good,
Can we ask you to do something when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
You had to deal with your own guilt.
But the time to blame is over.
When I get back,
I still want you in my life.
I've always been.
I always am.
I will always be.
That's nice.
Because I clung to you.
I love you, Mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Mack.
Hi friend.
Are you awake.
Where am I?
You are in the hospital.
Where is Papa?
I'll call the doctor and the family.
Right.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack?
Where was it?
I need to talk to Kate.
Calm down.
And Nan.
Josh.
I need to tell them.
Are here.
The nurse went to call them.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Dude, you got hit by a truck.
Yesterday?
No, Friday.
After you steal my truck.
This is impossible.
I spent the weekend in the cabin.
Mack, you never got there.
Yes I arrived.
Yes I arrived.
I was there.
Right.
Dude, this is a lot to digest, right?
I knew God.
Papa said to tell you that he loves you very much.
Mack?
Take a rest.
Are you alright.
Excuse.
For everything.
It's all right.
It's okay, we'll talk later, dear.
You just need to rest now.
I have so much to tell you about...
The lake
And Pope.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's all right.
She is more than fine.
She is happy.
She is beautiful.
She is very beautiful.
Hi, champ.
Hi dear.
You are strong.
Thank you.
Give me a minute with Kate.
Yes.
Thank you.
You.
I know things are not
Very good between us lately.
I was so lost in my sadness,
I was not able to help you with yours.
I'm so sorry.
Kate.
None of this is your fault.
I...
I should not have stood in that boat.
Look at me.
Do not think about the past.
Everything will be alright.
I know what it feels like to feel what you're carrying.
And I'm starting to learn how to forget.
I hope it's something we can learn together.
It does not matter what is going on.
You'll never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you too, Dad.
I love you very much, Kate.
That afternoon,
Mack told Nan everything.
I believe in you.
Over the next few weeks,
Mack improved quickly.
I know that some will ask
If it all happened the way Mack remembers.
Or if something like that actually happened.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose...
But the changes I see every day in my friend,
Are enough evidence for me.
Willie said it was easy.
He'll give me $ 10 if I beat him.
That's easy money.
Did you bring me a stick?
Choice.
I brought it to you too if you're lucky.
You can be sure.
The great sadness was gone.
Mack spent most of his days with a deep sense of joy.
He loved more than the others.
He forgives fast.
And it's faster still to ask for forgiveness.
Father.
He became a child again.
Very well!
Or maybe the child who never could be.
Staying in confidence and wonder.
I would not be surprised if, from time to time,
Mack took off his shoes.
Just to see if...
Well, you know.
* THE HUT *
Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
- No!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
Listen.
His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
Yeah.
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
That Sunday, when the preacher called... ♪ What can wash away my sin?
♪
He knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus a'
♪ What can make me whole again?
a'
- a' Nothing but the blood of Jesus S'
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
'
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Loudefl.
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪
♪ Lord God Almighty I
♪ Early in the morning A'
♪ Our song shall rise to Thee a'
♪ Holy, holy, holy...
A'
Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- Hmm?
- Dad, catch.
There's no room.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
- Cheese?
- Okay.
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
What did she look like?
Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His hear':
Broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
Careful near the water.
Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.

You have a nice family.
Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papauv?"
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die'?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
- Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
- I can't get him!
- Need help?
He okay?
- He's got him.
Come on, Dad!
Hang on.
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
- Come on, Josh.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
Come on, Josh!
There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the Imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.
Shh...
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
- They tipped over the boat.
- Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Shh...
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
- You're okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- We gotta go.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, Mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
- What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it'?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
' Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
- No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack...
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it'?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God'?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
You're not thinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
Wwmm I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some Papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
I told you.
Mackenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're... lam.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
- It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We, urn...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Watch this one.
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right'?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Night, Mack!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
♪ Your heart A'
♪ Try to be sure I
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My What?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out'?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So... you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Daddy!
Daddy!
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
- What?
- You heard me.
This is...
That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
- I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right'?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him?
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
"You're not comm"?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going-."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
What about this boy'?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy...
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
- How was it'?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me'?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Here we are.
This is it?
To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
What are those?
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
Wwmm I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya'?
Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I forgive...
I forgive you.
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it Will.
Let's go.
Let's bring Missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I love you, Mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
- Mack'?
- Rest.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey, Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy-
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
♪ He reigns from Heaven above I
♪ With wisdom, power, and love S'
♪ Our God is an awesome God A'
I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
He loves larger than most...
He's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
[Willie] Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
II'
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
[glass shattering]
- [woman, whimpering] No!
- [man] Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
- Listen.
- [woman screams]
[Willie] His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
- [grunting] - [woman whimpers]
[Willie] Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
- [scoffs] Yeah.
- [woman sobs]
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm. [Sighs]
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
[organ playing]
[Willie] That Sunday, when the preacher called... [congregation] ♪ What can wash away my sin?
♪
He knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus a'
♪ What can make me whole again?
a'
- a' Nothing but the blood of Jesus S'
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
[Sobbing]
[thunder rumbling]
[Mack's Dad] Why do you make me do this, boy?
[Mack grunts]
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
' [Grunts]
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Loudefl.
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
[thunder rumbling]
- [grunts] - [Mack sobbing]
[Willie] The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
[Mack's father coughs]
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
[gasps]
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
- [Mack chuckles]
- Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
[Willie] Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- [Nan] Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
[laughs] I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
[Willie] I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
[all] ♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪
♪ Lord God Almighty I
♪ Early in the morning A'
♪ Our song shall rise to Thee a'
♪ Holy, holy, holy...
A'
[Willie] Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
[singing continues]
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
[Mack] No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
[phone beeps]
II'
[spluttering] [engine stops]
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
[Kate] Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- [Mack] Hmm?
- [Kate] Dad, catch.
[Mack] There's no room.
[chuckles]
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
- Yeah.
- [sighs]
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- [Kate] You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
[sighs]
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
- I can tell the difference.
- [Mack chuckles]
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
[Mack growls]
- Cheese?
- [Nan] Okay.
[shutter clicks]
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
II'
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
[Mack] A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
[Missy] What did she look like?
[Mack] Well, she was very pretty.
[Missy] What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
[sniffles]
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His hear':
Broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
[Mack] Careful near the water.
[Kate, laughing] Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
[grunting]
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
[both laugh]
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.

[Mack] You have a nice family.
[Emil] Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papauv?"
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
[whispers] Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
[Missy] Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die'?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
[Mack sighs]
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
(0K3)'-
Good night, Daddy.
[softly] Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
[Missy] Daddy, red or blue?
[sighs] What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
[Kate] Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
[Kate yells]
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
[screaming] Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
- Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
- I can't get him!
[both gasp]
- [man 1] Need help?
He okay?
- [man 2] He's got him.
Come on, Dad!
Hang on.
[man 3] Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
[grunting]
- [Kate] Come on, Josh.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
- Come on, Josh!
There we go.
- [coughs]
There we go.
That's it.
[Kate sighs]
II'
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
[Emil] Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
[dog barking]
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
[Panting]
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
[sirens chirp] [officer] We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
[sighs]
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
[indistinct]
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
[sighs]
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
[sighs]
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
[officer over radio] We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the lmnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
[indistinct chatter]
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
[Kate] Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
[Kate] I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- [Kate] I'm so sorry.
Shh...
[Nan] Hey.
[whispers] Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
- They tipped over the boat.
- Shh.
I know.
- Hey.
- [Sobbing]
Shh...
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
[mack] Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
- You're okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- [officer] We gotta go.
[Mack] Okay.
Okay.

[tap running]

Hey, Mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
- What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it'?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
[TV announcer speaking indistinctly]
II'
[door opens] ' [Nan] Mack!
Hey!
- [door shuts]
- We're home!
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
[sighs] Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I g0?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
- No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
II'
[indistinct whispering]
[engine starts]
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack...
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
[sighs]
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
[sighs] Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it'?
- I just want your truck.
- [laughs]
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God'?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- [Josh] Yeah.
Thanks.
- Text me when you get there?
- [sighs]
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
[engine starts]
[honks]
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
[laughs] I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
[engine starting]
II'
[Willie] You're not thinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
[Nan] I don't wanna lose you, too.
[Missy giggles] [horn blaring]
[tires screeching] [panting]
[mumbles] [exhales]
([whispers] He)'-
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
II'
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
[screaming]
Wwmm I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
[footsteps approaching]
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some Papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
II'
[birds chirping]
[wings fluttering]
[softly] NQ_
[woman exclaims excitedly] [man, laughing] I told you.
[laughter]
Mackenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm... [laughs]
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're... lam.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
[both laughing]
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
- Sarah who?
- [all laugh]
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
II'
[door closes]
Why'd I have to wake up?
[Jesus] Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
[chuckles]
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
[reggae music playing on earphones]
- [humming] - [door opens] [door closes]
[music stops]
You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
[sighs]
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
[chuckles]
I think that's Santa.
[continues chuckling]
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
[sighs]
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
[exhales]
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
[chirping]
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
[laughing]
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
[all laugh]
- [Jesus] It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
- You think?
- [chuckles]
How's Kate doin'?
We, urn...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
[laughing]
It is good.
- [laughing continues] - [soft piano playing]
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
[all] Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
[Papa] I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
[Jesus] Watch this one.
[Mack] Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right'?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
[laughs]
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
[Mack] The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
[upbeat music playing]
[Papa and Sarayu laughing]
[Whooping] ' [Papa] Yes!
II'
[Papa] Night, Mack!
[Mack groaning]
- [Missy] Daddy!
- [Mack gasps]
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
' [gasps] [breathes heavily]
[Papa humming]
♪ Your heart A'
♪ Try to be sure I
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My What?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope. [Chuckles]
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will everjustify what happened to her.
[plates shatter]
[sighs]
Looking for the way out'?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
[sighs]
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
II'
[animal calls]
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
[chuckles] That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
[soft chuckle]
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
[soft chuckle]
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
II'
[hammering]
[hammering continues]
So... you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
[laughs]
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
II'
[Kate] Daddy!
Daddy!
[boat rocks]
[thud]
[thud] [panting]
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [Jesus] Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
[Jesus] This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
[Jesus] Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
[Jesus] Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
[breathes calmly]
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
- What?
- You heard me.
This is...
That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
- I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right'?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
[sighs]
All right.
Here we go.
[exhaling sharply through teeth]
[exhales sharply]
[exhaling sharply] [chuckles] This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
[both chuckle]
Yeah, okay.
Good.
[Mack chuckles nervously]
How are you doing?
- I'm still freakin' out.
- [chuckles]
Looks like we've got company.
II'
Look at this.
[Jesus chuckles]
Look!
See him?
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
[chuckles]
[laughing]
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
[soft chuckle] [sighs]
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
"You're not comm"?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
II'
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
- Trust me.
- [scoffs]
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
II'
"Keep going-."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I... [sighs]
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
[soft chuckle]
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
II'
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
[sighs] Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
[Mack's mother] Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
[Mack's mother screams]
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
[Sophia] What about this boy'?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
[boy] Yes, sir.
[panting] [boy crying]
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
[Missy] Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
[soft chuckle]
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
[muffled chuckle]
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
[sighs]
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
[water splashing]
II'
[children chattering]
[children laughing]
Missy... [laughs]
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
[Jesus] Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
II'
[Mack sighs]
- How was it'?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
[water sloshing]
[Jesus laughs]
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
II'
[both laughing]
God has time to catch a few rays?
[chuckles]
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
[chuckles]
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
[whispers] Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me'?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
[chuckles]
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
[Papa chuckles]
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
II'
[Jesus] Here we are.
This is it?
[Sarayu] To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
II'
What are those?
[Sarayu] Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
Wwmm I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
[door opens] [man] Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
[chuckles]
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya'?
Oh, always.
[sighs]
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
II'
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
[Papa groans] [sighs]
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
II' [sobbing]
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
II'
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
'III
I forgive...
I forgive you.
[soft piano playing]
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it Will.
Let's go.
II'
Let's bring Missy home.
[Mack] I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
II'
[crying]
Please, please!
[continues crying]
[We Are Messengers' "I'll Think About You" playing]
[sighs heavily]
[Jesus chanting prayers indistinctly]
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
[sighs]
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
[soft chuckle]
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
[faintly] I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
[chuckles]
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
[sighs]
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
[laughter]
- [Jesus] I love you, Mack.
- [laughter continues]
II'
[horn blaring] [glass shattering]
[Willie] Mack?
Mack?
Mack.
[chuckling] Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
[Mack] Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
[chuckling] Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
[groans]
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
[chuckles]
- Mack'?
- Rest.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
- Hey, Hey.
- [Crying] [sniffles]
She's more than okay.
She's happy-
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
II'
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
[Sobbing] I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
[crying]
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're g0in' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
II'
[Willie] That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
[Willie] Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
[all] ♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
♪ He reigns from Heaven above I
♪ With wisdom, power, and love S'
♪ Our God is an awesome God A' [inaudible]
[Willie] I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- [Mack] Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 1O bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
- He loves larger than most...
- [laughter]
He's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
[Josh] Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
[Tim McGraw Faith Hill's "Keep Your Eyes On Me" playing]
[WILLIE] Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
[###]
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
[GLASS SHATTERING]
- [WOMAN, WHIMPERING] No!
- [MAN] Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
- Listen.
- [WOMAN SCREAMS]
[WILLIE] His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
- [GRUNTING] - [WOMAN WHIMPERS]
[WILLIE] Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
- [SCOFFS] Yeah.
- [WOMAN SOBS]
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm. [SIGHS]
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
[ORGAN PLAYING]
[WILLIE] That Sunday, when the preacher called...
[CONGREGATION] # What can wash away my sin?
# ...he knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
# Nothing but the blood of Jesus #
# What can make me whole again?
#
- # Nothing but the blood of Jesus #
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
[SOBBING]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MACK'S DAD] Why do you make me do this, boy?
[MACK GRUNTS]
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
- Say it!
- [GRUNTS]
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Louder!
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
- [GRUNTS] - [MACK SOBBING]
[WILLIE] The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
[MACK'S FATHER COUGHS]
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
[GASPS]
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
- [MACK CHUCKLES]
- Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
[WILLIE] Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- [NAN] Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
[LAUGHS] I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
[WILLIE] I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
[ALL] # Holy, holy, holy #
# Lord God Almighty #
# Early in the morning #
# Our song shall rise to Thee #
# Holy, holy, holy... #
[WILLIE] Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
[SINGING CONTINUES]
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
[MACK] No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
[PHONE BEEPS]
[###]
[SPLUTTERING]
[ENGINE STOPS]
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
[GRUNTS]
[KATE] Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- [MACK] Hmm?
- [KATE] Dad, catch.
[MACK] There's no room. [CHUCKLES]
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
- Yeah.
- [SIGHS]
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- [KATE] You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
[SIGHS]
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
- I can tell the difference.
- [MACK CHUCKLES]
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
[MACK GROWLS]
- Cheese?
- [NAN] Okay.
[SHUTTER CLICKS]
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
[###]
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
[MACK] A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
[MISSY] What did she look like?
[MACK] Well, she was very pretty.
[MISSY] What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
[SNIFFLES]
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
[MACK] Careful near the water.
[KATE, LAUGHING] Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
[GRUNTING]
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.
- [ EMIL] # The other day # - [ALL] # The other day #
- # I saw a bear # - # I saw a bear #
- # A way up there # - # A way up there #
# The other day I saw a bear #
# A great big bear way up there #
[LAUGHING]
- # He looked at me # - # He looked at me #
- # I looked at him # - # I looked at him #
- # He sized up me # - # He sized up me #
[MACK] You have a nice family.
[ EMIL] Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
[WHISPERS] Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
[MISSY] Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
[MACK SIGHS]
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, Daddy.
[SOFTLY] Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
[MISSY] Daddy, red or blue?
[SIGHS] What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
[KATE] Daddy!
Look at me!
- Stop!
- Daddy!
[KATE YELLS]

- Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

Come on, Dad!

Hey.

- Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
- Come on, Josh!
There we go.

There we go.
That's it.

Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
[EMIL] Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
[DOG BARKING]
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's Missy?
I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
[PANTING]
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
[SIRENS CHIRP]
[OFFICER] We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
[SIGHS]
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
[INDISTINCT]
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
[SIGHS]
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
[SIGHS]
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
[OFFICER OVER RADIO] We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the Imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
[KATE] Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
[KATE] I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- [KATE] I'm so sorry.
Shh...
[NAN] Hey.
[WHISPERS] Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
- They tipped over the boat.
- Shh.
I know.
- Hey.
- [SOBBING]
Hey.

Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
[MACK] Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
- You're okay?

- What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...

- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
[SIGHS] Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
- No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?

Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
[SIGHS]
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
[SIGHS] Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
- I just want your truck.
- [LAUGHS]
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- [JOSH] Yeah.
Thanks.
- Text me when you get there?
- [SIGHS]
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?

Mackenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm... [LAUGHS]
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
- Sarah who?
- [ALL LAUGH]
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
[ALL] I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.

You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
[CHUCKLES]
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
[REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES]

You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
[SIGHS]
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
[CHUCKLES]
I think that's Santa.
[CONTINUES CHUCKLING]
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
[SIGHS]
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
[EXHALES]
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
[CHIRPING]
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
[LAUGHING]
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
[ALL LAUGH]
- [JESUS] It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
- You think?
- [CHUCKLES]
How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
[LAUGHING]
It is good.
- [LAUGHING CONTINUES] - [SOFT PIANO PLAYING]
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
[ALL] Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
[PAPA] I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
[JESUS] Watch this one.
[MACK] Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
[LAUGHS]
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
[MACK] The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[PAPA AND SARAYU LAUGHING]
- [WHOOPING] - [PAPA] Yes!
[###]
[PAPA] Night, Mack!
[MACK GROANING]
- [MISSY] Daddy!
- [MACK GASPS]
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- [GASPS]
[BREATHES HEAVILY]
[PAPA HUMMING]
# Your heart #
# Try to be sure #
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope. [CHUCKLES]
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
[PLATES SHATTER]
[SIGHS]
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
[SIGHS]
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
[###]
[ANIMAL CALLS]
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
[CHUCKLES] That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess. [SOFT CHUCKLE]
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
[###]
[HAMMERING]
[HAMMERING CONTINUES]
So... you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
[LAUGHS]
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
[###]
[KATE] Daddy!
Daddy!
[BOAT ROCKS]
[THUD]
[THUD]
[PANTING]
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [JESUS] Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
[JESUS] This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
[JESUS] Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
[JESUS] Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
[BREATHES CALMLY]
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
- What?
- You heard me.
This is...
That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
- I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
[SIGHS]
All right.
Here we go.
[EXHALING SHARPLY THROUGH TEETH]
[EXHALES SHARPLY]
[EXHALING SHARPLY]
[CHUCKLES] This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Yeah, okay.
Good.
[MACK CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
How are you doing?
- I'm still freakin' out.
- [CHUCKLES]
Looks like we've got company.
[###]
Look at this.
[JESUS CHUCKLES]
Look!
See him?
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHING]
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
[SIGHS]
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
[###]
- I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
- Trust me.
- [SCOFFS]
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
[###]
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
[SIGHS]
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
[###]
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
[SIGHS] Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
[MACK'S MOTHER] Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
[MACK'S MOTHER SCREAMS]
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
[SOPHIA] What about this boy?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
[BOY] Yes, sir.
[PANTING]
[BOY CRYING]
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
[MISSY] Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might. 'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
[MUFFLED CHUCKLE]
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
[SIGHS]
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
[WATER SPLASHING]
[###]
[CHILDREN CHATTERING]
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]
Missy...
[LAUGHS]
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
[JESUS] Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
[###]
[MACK SIGHS]
- How was it?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
[WATER SLOSHING]
[JESUS LAUGHS]
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
[###]
[BOTH LAUGHING]
God has time to catch a few rays?
[CHUCKLES]
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
[CHUCKLES]
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
[WHISPERS] Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
[CHUCKLES]
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
[PAPA CHUCKLES]
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
[###]
[JESUS] Here we are.
This is it?
[SARAYU] To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
[###]
What are those?
[SARAYU] Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
[CRYING] I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
[DOOR OPENS]
[MAN] Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
[CHUCKLES]
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Oh, always.
[SIGHS]
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
[###]
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
[PAPA GROANS]
[SIGHS]
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
[###]
[SOBBING]
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
[###]
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
[SOFT PIANO PLAYING]
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
[###]
Let's bring Missy home.
[MACK] I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
[###]
[CRYING]
Please, please!
[CONTINUES CRYING]
[WE ARE MESSENGERS' "I'LL THINK ABOUT YOU" PLAYING]
[SIGHS HEAVILY]
[JESUS CHANTING PRAYERS INDISTINCTLY]
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
[SIGHS]
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
[FAINTLY] I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
[SIGHS]
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
[LAUGHTER]
- [JESUS] I love you, Mack.
- [LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
[###]
[HORN BLARING]
[GLASS SHATTERING]
[WILLIE] Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
[CHUCKLING] Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
[MACK] Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
[CHUCKLING] Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
[GROANS]
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
[CHUCKLES]
- Mack?
- Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
- Hey.
Hey.
- [CRYING]
[SNIFFLES]
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
[###]
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
[SOBBING] I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
[CRYING]
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
[###]
[WILLIE] That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
[WILLIE] Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
[ALL] # Our God is an awesome God #
# He reigns from Heaven above #
# With wisdom, power, and love #
# Our God is an awesome God #
[INAUDIBLE]
[WILLIE] I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- [MACK] Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
- He loves larger than most...
- [LAUGHTER] he's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
[JOSH] Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
[TIM MCGRAW FAITH HILL'S "KEEP YOUR EYES ON ME" PLAYING]
[###]
Whowouldn'tbe skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
Mack was born in the midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
No!
- Look at me!
Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
- Listen.
Hisfatherwas an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
Especiallywhen the rain didn't come, or came too early...
- Yeah.
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No thanks.
- That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
ThatSunday, when the preacher called... he knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell him what you're sorry for.
I can't make him stop.
I try, but when he drinks, he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
- "Obey your parents in everything,
"for this pleases the lord."
- Louder!
Colossians 3:20! "Obey your parents in everything,
"for this pleases the lord!"
Thebeatinglasted well into the night.
What happened after that,
Mack doesn't like to talk about.
c:#00FFFFI hope someday you can forgive me
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside.
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're Ok.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
- Pause!
Pause!
Ok.
- Josh!
- Never mind, forget it.
Jo... are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is, if she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does he care if we're late for church?
She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Ok, come on.
- It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
- Since when do I control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
ImetMack at church 10 years ago.
Backthen,he didn't know God the way Nan did.
If his relationship was wide,
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa"
and talked to him like an old friend, which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant, when the great sadness came uninvited.
c:#FFFFFFTHE SHACK
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm Ok.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
- How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
c:#00FFFFMackenzie
c:#00FFFFMackenzie, It's been a while.
I've missed you.
c:#00FFFFI'll be at the shack next weekend if you want to get together Papa
Hey,dad.
Dad?
Hmm?
Dad, catch.
- There's no room.
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
- First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
- Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your dad's mothering skills.
You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna the carpet beetles.
Wanda the walking stick.
And that's Carl the caterpillar.
"Carl the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl the caterpillar behind.
- Not a good idea.
No.
- I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
Cool.
- We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
- Ok, Ok.
Come on.
Cheese?
- Ok.
Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Ok!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
- Daddy, we have to stop!
Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
- What princess?
Come on, dad, you have to.
You have to tell her the story.
We have to go back.
- Please!
- We can't go back.
We can't just keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
- The answer is no.
A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
What did she look like?
- Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you this story?
Ok.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The great spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah falls was created.
Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your mommy, didn't ya?
c:#FF0000WALLOWA LAKE STATE PARK
Careful near the water.
- Ok, dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
- Yeah, well, i suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
Great!
I'll see you later.
You have a nice family.
- Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
- I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but kids love it.
Daddy.
- I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
Yeah.
- How come she had to die?
Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in the Bible, so it must be true.
Is the great spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The great spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Ok.
Good night, daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
- She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
- Hey, hey, hey, you Ok?
- I can't get him!
Need help?
He Ok?
- He's got him.
- Come on, dad!
Hang on.
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
Hey.
Come on, Josh.
Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
Come on.
Josh!
- There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
You check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
You Ok?
- Where is she, dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Ok?
Not here.
- My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
- Missy!
Emily!
Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
- I found them.
Where's Missy?
- I'm sorry, Mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Missy!
Oh, God.
Please, God.
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it.
Anything out of place.
You said she was there.
- Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
- That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
- I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
Yeah.
Let me check this... yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my Missy?
- We don't know anything for sure.
We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Mom!
It's Ok.
It's Ok, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
They tipped over the boat.
Shh.
I know.
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
- Ok.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
- Mack, you Ok?
You're Ok?
- Ok.
Ok.
- We gotta go.
Ok.
Ok.
Hey, Mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
What the heck is this?
- What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You...
You think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
- Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
- Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox "with no tracks in the snow,
"and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
- Mack...
Mack!
Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
Hey, dad.
- Hey, champ.
You Ok?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
Where's Kate?
- She'll be in, in a minute.
Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
- Hey, dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
It's only two streets away.
Another time.
Hey, you.
- Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh...
Same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and...
Thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
Uh... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.
No.
- Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack.
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well... have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
- What?
You think it's God?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Ok.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
Sweetie, can you take this?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's Ok if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Ok?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
You'renotthinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some Papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, Mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
No.
I told you.
MacKenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
- Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this.
To finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
- I am.
The "I am"?
- I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
- Of course.
- And I'm Sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So...
Which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's Ok, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Ok.
You remember that smell?
Ma griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
Course I did.
- Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because... here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you... with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out.
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great Gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
- Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you, she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, MacKenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
"Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it himself.
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him.
I never left you.
I never left Missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something i want for you.
That's why you're here, MacKenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
- How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to...
- No.
It's Ok.
I did make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
- Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
- I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Ok.
Watch this one.
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Night, Mack!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
- Daddy!
Daddy!
Mornin', Mack.
You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window.
Lettin' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
- Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
- Your wrath.
You lost me there.
- Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
- Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
MacKenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
- Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way.
Just beyond the trees.
You might need these though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden
I was hoping you could help me with.
Before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
Ok, this is a mess.
It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Ok.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
- Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you...
Each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So, you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No, no, no, no, no.
- Mack!
Mack, it's Ok.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
- Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, Mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be Ok.
Look at me.
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, Mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now...
let's get you out of this boat.
What?
- You heard me.
This is... that's not funny.
- I'm not joking.
You can do this.
I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.
I'll sink.
- No, Mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
- Just start walking.
Yeah, Ok.
Good.
How are you doing?
- I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him!
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family, to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
This is a path only you can take.
I thought you said you'd never leave me.
- And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
- I am wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy his child?
- Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, MacKenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
- What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
- What about men who beat their wives?
Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
What about this boy?
What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
- But you already have.
That boy is your father.
- Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
- Daddy!
Daddy!
Ok, that's enough.
- Is that man guilty?
I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father?
The man who twisted him into this deviant monster.
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't he at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if he knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God...
You must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
- Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
MacKenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
- You must.
This isn't a game.
- You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
- You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
MacKenzie, you've judged your children worthy of love,
even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, MacKenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
- He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God,
evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy.
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She Ok?
- More than you know.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
- For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
How was it?
Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, MacKenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
I had no idea.
- It's Ok.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,
why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits.
Yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, MacKenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Here we are.
This is it?
To your eyes.
Just for tonight, we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Ok.
What are those?
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father i could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Let's go home.
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
- Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
Where we going?
- Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be...
very painful for you.
Please, don't.
- Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
- Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt...
Like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
- And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you.
Robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
MacKenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1.000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's bring Missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, MacKenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind.
But only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive... with every act of kindness,
the universe changes.
For the better.
- Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
- Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back,
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
- I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I love you, Mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Ok.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack?
Was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
I was there.
Ok.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
Mack?
- Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're Ok.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
- Shh.
It's Ok.
It's Ok, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's Ok.
Hey.
Hey.
She's more than Ok.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be Ok.
I know what it feels like to carry what you'd been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
- I love you, too, dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
Thatafternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
Overthenextfew weeks,
Mack improved rapidly.
I'msurethere are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- Hey.
Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
- That's easy money.
You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
Thegreatsadnessisgone .
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
He loves larger than most.
He's quick to forgive.
And even quicker to ask forgiveness.
Dad.
Hehasbecomea child again.
- All right!
Whoo!
Ormaybethechildhe was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes.
Just to see if...
Well, you know.

[WILLIE] Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with God?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the... well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
[♪♪♪]
Mack was born in the Midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
[GLASS SHATTERING]
- [WOMAN, WHIMPERING] No!
- [MAN] Look at me!
- Look at me!
- You're hurting me.
- Listen.
- [WOMAN SCREAMS]
[WILLIE] His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
- Closet drinker.
- Leave him alone.
- [GRUNTING] - [WOMAN WHIMPERS]
[WILLIE] Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
- [SCOFFS] Yeah.
- [WOMAN SOBS]
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No, thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm. [SIGHS]
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to God.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
[ORGAN PLAYING]
[WILLIE] That Sunday, when the preacher called...
[CONGREGATION] ♪ What can wash away my sin?
♪
He knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus ♪
♪ What can make me whole again?
♪
- ♪ Nothing but the blood of Jesus ♪
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell Him what you're sorry for.
I can't make Him stop.
I try, but when he drinks... he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
[SOBBING]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MACK'S DAD] Why do you make me do this, boy?
[MACK GRUNTS]
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
- Say it!
- [GRUNTS]
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
Louder!
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord!"
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
- [GRUNTS] - [MACK SOBBING]
[WILLIE] The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, Mack doesn't like to talk about.
[MACK'S FATHER COUGHS]
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside...
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
[GASPS]
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and Nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
- Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
- Josh!
Jo...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
- He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
- He's trying to impress Ally Taylor.
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!
- Who's Ally?
- Well, I don't care who it is.
If she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if God is always with us, why does He care if we're late for church?
- She's got a point.
- Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
- [MACK CHUCKLES]
- Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
[WILLIE] Good morning.
- Hi, guys.
- [NAN] Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
[LAUGHS] I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
[WILLIE] I met Mack at church 10 years ago.
[ALL] ♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪
♪ Lord God Almighty ♪
♪ Early in the morning ♪
♪ Our song shall rise to Thee ♪
♪ Holy, holy, holy... ♪
[WILLIE] Back then, he didn't know God the way Nan did.
[SINGING CONTINUES]
If his relationship was wide...
Nan's was deep.
She called God "Papa" and talked to him like an old friend... which was never something Mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant... when the Great Sadness came uninvited.
[MACK] No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
[PHONE BEEPS]
[♪♪♪]
[SPLUTTERING]
[ENGINE STOPS]
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing Nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, Nan left me food in the fridge.
- Maybe next time.
- All right.
Thanks.
All right.
[GRUNTS]
[KATE] Hey, Dad.
Dad?
- [MACK] Hmm?
- [KATE] Dad, catch.
[MACK] There's no room. [CHUCKLES]
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
- Yeah.
- [SIGHS]
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your Dad's mothering skills.
- [KATE] You do?
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
- My insect collection.
- Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
- No, Daddy.
- No?
This is Dixie and Donna, the carpet beetles.
Wanda, the walking stick.
And that's Carl, the caterpillar.
"Carl, the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
[SIGHS]
We can't leave Carl, the caterpillar, behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
- I can tell the difference.
- [MACK CHUCKLES]
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
- Sure.
- Cool.
We gotta... we gotta go.
Hey, a little patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
[MACK GROWLS]
- Cheese?
- [NAN] Okay.
[SHUTTER CLICKS]
- Good-looking bunch.
- Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
[♪♪♪]
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
- Let's go see the waterfall.
- No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told Missy the story of the Indian princess?
What princess?
Come on, Dad, you have to!
You have to tell her the story.
- We have to go back.
- Please!
We can't go back.
- We can't keep pulling off every exit.
- Come on.
The answer is no.
[MACK] A long time ago, there was an Indian princess.
[MISSY] What did she look like?
[MACK] Well, she was very pretty.
[MISSY] What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you the story?
Okay.
Well, this princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
[SNIFFLES]
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how Multnomah Falls was created.
- Ready to go?
- Shotgun.
A little patience, please.
You got that off your Mommy, didn't ya?
[MACK] Careful near the water.
[KATE, LAUGHING] Okay, Dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
[GRUNTING]
There we go.
- I'm Mack.
- Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
- Those two yours?
- They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
- That sounds good.
- Great!
I'll see you later.

Daddy, we need to say our prayers to Papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for God.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but the kids love it.
- Daddy.
- I'll be back.
[WHISPERS] Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
[MISSY] Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
- Yeah.
- How come she had to die?
- Who?
- The Indian princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
[MACK SIGHS]
It's in The Bible, so it must be true.
Is the Great Spirit another name for Papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The Great Spirit made the princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your Mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would God ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, Daddy.
[SOFTLY] Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, Dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
[MISSY] Daddy, red or blue?
[SIGHS] What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
[KATE] Daddy!

Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen Missy?
- No.
- Can you check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
- You okay?
- Where is she, Dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
[EMIL] Emily!
- Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
- I didn't see anybody.
Missy?

[SIRENS CHIRP]
[OFFICER] We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it, anything out of place.
- You said she was there.
- Yeah.
[SIGHS]
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not Missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
- Yeah.
Let me check this clearing...
- Yeah.
[INDISTINCT]
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
[SIGHS]
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the Feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
[SIGHS]
Do you think he took my Missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
[OFFICER OVER RADIO] We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the Imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your Missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
[KATE] Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
[KATE] I'm so sorry.
- I'm here.
- [KATE] I'm so sorry.
Shh...

Some kind of sick joke?
You... you think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "Papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow, and it might've been signed by God"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.

[SIGHS] Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
- Where's Kate?
- She'll be in in a minute.
- Tried calling you this morning.
- You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, Dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at Ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
- It's only two streets away.
- Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh... same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and... thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
I... think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
- Mack.
- Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
- Well, there's no stamp.

Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?

Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
[SIGHS]
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
[SIGHS] Well...
Have you talked with Nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
- I just want your truck.
- [LAUGHS]
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's God?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
- Sweetie, can you take this?
- [JOSH] Yeah.
Thanks.
- Text me when you get there?

Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.

Mmm-mmm!
Mmm... [LAUGHS]
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this, to finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what Nan does.
You know Nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Look at that.
Already quoting' Scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, Mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm Sarayu.
- Sarah who?
- [ALL LAUGH]
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So... which one of you is...
[ALL] I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.

Why'd I have to wake up?
[JESUS] Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
[CHUCKLES]
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help Sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to Papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but... you're gonna be all right, Mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
[REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES]

You remember that smell?
Ma Griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
- Am I dead?
- Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
'Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
[SIGHS]
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
[CHUCKLES]
I think that's Santa.
[CONTINUES CHUCKLING]
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out...
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
[SIGHS]
I know what a great gulf there is between us, Mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty God, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow... you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most... you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of Me.
[EXHALES]
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you... she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, Mackenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
- "Truth"?
- Mmm.
I know that story.
You left Him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it Himself.
"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
No, Mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him, I never left you.
I never left Missy.
[CHIRPING]
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like... clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, Mackenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
[LAUGHING]
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
- You mean Ally?
- Mmm.
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
[ALL LAUGH]
- [JESUS] It's cute.
- Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
- You think?
- [CHUCKLES]
How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I didn't make it.
[LAUGHING]
It is good.
- [LAUGHING CONTINUES] - [SOFT PIANO PLAYING]
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
[ALL] Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and Nan.
But if you're real... then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
[PAPA] I'll take this round.
Why don't you show Mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
[JESUS] Watch this one.
[MACK] Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're God, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to Papa and Sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And Sarayu, oh, geez.
[LAUGHS]
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, Mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
[MACK] The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.

You like Neil Young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope. [CHUCKLES]
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
Mackenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
[PLATES SHATTER]
[SIGHS]
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way, just beyond the trees.
You might need these, though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
[SIGHS]
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden I was hoping you could help me with before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.

[ANIMAL CALLS]
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
[CHUCKLES] That isn't the word in your head.
- Okay, this is a mess.
- It is, isn't it?
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
- But this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me... or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you... each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing God.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess. [SOFT CHUCKLE]
Yes, it is, Mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.

Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
[LAUGHS]
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.

That's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.

Where's the fun in that?
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHING]
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, Mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
[SIGHS]
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing Papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.

"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
[SIGHS]
You are?
I am Wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
You don't believe that God is good?
Is Missy His child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think God loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
- Judge you?
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
- What?
- Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, Mackenzie.
Sit.
All right.
[♪♪♪]
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
[SIGHS] Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
[MACK'S MOTHER] Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
[MACK'S MOTHER SCREAMS]
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
[SOPHIA] What about this boy?
- What about him?
- Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
[BOY] Yes, sir.
[PANTING]
[BOY CRYING]
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
[MISSY] Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
- I would damn him to hell.
- And what of his father, the man who twisted him into this deviant monster?
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about God?
Isn't He at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if He knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... you must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe God does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or... you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
Mackenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
Mackenzie...
You've judged your children worthy of love... even if it costs you everything.
Now you know Papa's heart.
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
You know, what I don't understand is how God can love Missy and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might. 'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your God is, Mackenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not God's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to Missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
[MUFFLED CHUCKLE]
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow God, evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
[SIGHS]
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
[WATER SPLASHING]
[♪♪♪]
[CHILDREN CHATTERING]
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]
Missy...
[LAUGHS]
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
[JESUS] Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does Nan or Papa.
It's time to let that go.
[♪♪♪]
[MACK SIGHS]
- How was it?
- Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
[WATER SLOSHING]
[JESUS LAUGHS]
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
[♪♪♪]
[BOTH LAUGHING]
God has time to catch a few rays?
[CHUCKLES]
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, Mackenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see Missy.
[CHUCKLES]
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And Missy's a special girl.
[WHISPERS] Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you...
Why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
[CHUCKLES]
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear God just call me an idiot?
[PAPA CHUCKLES]
If the shoe fits, yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, Mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, Mackenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
[♪♪♪]
[JESUS] Here we are.
This is it?
[SARAYU] To your eyes.
Just for tonight... we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
[♪♪♪]
What are those?
[SARAYU] Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
[CRYING] I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Yeah...
Let's go home.
[DOOR OPENS]
[MAN] Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
[CHUCKLES]
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Oh, always.
[SIGHS]
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
[♪♪♪]
- Where are we going?
- Almost there.
[PAPA GROANS]
[SIGHS]
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt... like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
[♪♪♪]
[SOBBING]
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
- What he did...
- Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you, robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
[♪♪♪]
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
[SOFT PIANO PLAYING]
Mackenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
[♪♪♪]
Let's bring Missy home.
[MACK] I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
[♪♪♪]
[CRYING]
Please, please!
[CONTINUES CRYING]
[WE ARE MESSENGERS' "I'LL THINK ABOUT YOU" PLAYING]
[SIGHS HEAVILY]
[JESUS CHANTING PRAYERS INDISTINCTLY]
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, Mackenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Mackenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to Nan and your children.
[SIGHS]
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about Missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind, but only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
[SOFT CHUCKLE]
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
[FAINTLY] I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, Mack, or forgive, with every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for Missy's death.
[SIGHS]
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back...
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
[LAUGHTER]
- [JESUS] I love you, Mack.

[GLASS SHATTERING]
[WILLIE] Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
[CHUCKLING] Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
[MACK] Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's Papa?
- I'll go get the doctor and the family.
- Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, Mack, was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
- Hey, hey, settle down.
- And Nan.
And Josh.
- I gotta tell 'em.
- They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
[CHUCKLING] Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
[GROANS]
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
- I was there.
- Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met God.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
[CHUCKLES]
- Mack?
- Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about... the lake and Papa.
And Missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
- Hey.
Hey.
- [CRYING]
[SNIFFLES]
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
[♪♪♪]
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate... none of this is your fault.
[SOBBING] I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
[CRYING]
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you've been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn... how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
[♪♪♪]
[WILLIE] That afternoon, Mack told Nan everything.
I believe you.
[WILLIE] Over the next few weeks, Mack improved rapidly.
[ALL] ♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
♪ He reigns from Heaven above ♪
♪ With wisdom, power, and love ♪
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪
[INAUDIBLE]
[WILLIE] I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way Mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
- [MACK] Hey.
- Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
- You bring a pole for me?
- Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
The Great Sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
- He loves larger than most...
- [LAUGHTER]
He's quick to forgive, and even quicker to ask forgiveness.
[JOSH] Dad.
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then,
Mack takes off his shoes... just to see if... well, you know.
[TIM MCGRAW FAITH HILL'S "KEEP YOUR EYES ON ME" PLAYING]
[♪♪♪]
Willie:
Who wouldn't be skeptical when a man claims to have spent an entire weekend with god?
In a shack, no less.
And not just any shack.
This was the shack.
What I'm about to tell you is a little on the...
Well, it's a lot on the fantastic side.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.
Mack was born in the midwest.
A farm boy in an Irish-American family, committed to calloused hands and rigorous rules.
Woman:
No!
Man:
Look at me!
Look at me!
You're hurting me.
Listen.
Willie:
His father was an elder in the church.
What are you looking at, boy?
Closet drinker.
Leave him alone.
Willie:
Especially when the rain didn't come, or came too early...
Yeah.
Most times in between.
Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to god.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
Willie:
That Sunday, when the preacher called... he knew he couldn't stay silent any longer.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell him what you're sorry for.
I can't make him stop.
I try, but when he drinks, he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Mack's dad:
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
"Obey your parents in everything,"
"for this pleases the lord."
Louder!
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything,"
"for this pleases the lord!"
Willie:
The beating lasted well into the night.
What happened after that, mack doesn't like to talk about.
Let's just say pain has a way of twisting us up inside.
And making us do the unthinkable.
Thirteen is way too young to be all grown up.
The secrets we keep have a way of clawing their way to the surface.
You're okay.
Mack and nan had been married for 18 mostly happy years.
She's the glue that holds that family together.
Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
Josh!
Jo...
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
He's trying to impress ally Taylor.
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
Who's ally?
Well, I don't care who it is, if she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if god is always with us, why does he care if we're late for church?
She's got a point.
Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
Hi, guys.
Nan:
Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do I control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
Willie:
I met mack at church 10 years ago.
Willie:
Back then, he didn't know god the way nan did.
If his relationship was wide, nan's was deep.
She called god "papa"
and talked to him like an old friend, which was never something mack could relate to.
But together they still managed to create what most would call a good life.
But all that changed in an instant, when the great sadness came uninvited.
Mack:
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, I guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, nan left me food in the fridge.
Maybe next time.
All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Kate:
Hey, dad.
Dad?
Mack:
Hmm?
Kate:
Dad, catch.
Mack:
There's no room.
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your dad's mothering skills.
Kate:
You do?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
My insect collection.
Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
No, daddy.
No?
This is Dixie and Donna the carpet beetles.
Wanda the walking stick.
And that's Carl the caterpillar.
"Carl the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl the caterpillar behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
Sure.
Cool.
We gotta go.
Hey, a little Patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Cheese?
Nan:
Okay.
Good-looking bunch.
Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
Let's go see the waterfall.
No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told missy the story of the Indian Princess?
What Princess?
Come on, dad, you have to.
You have to tell her the story.
We have to go back.
Please!
We can't go back.
We can't just keep pulling off every exit.
Come on.
The answer is no.
Mack:
A long time ago, there was an Indian Princess.
Missy:
What did she look like?
Mack:
Well, she was very pretty.
Missy:
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you this story?
Okay.
Well, this Princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the Princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The great spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how multnomah falls was created.
Ready to go?
Shotgun.
A little Patience, please.
You got that off your mommy, didn't ya?
Mack:
Careful near the water.
Kate:
Okay, dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
I'm mack.
Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
Those two yours?
They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
That sounds good.
Great!
I'll see you later.
Mack:
You have a nice family.
Emil:
Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for god.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but kids love it.
Daddy.
I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Missy:
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
Yeah.
How come she had to die?
Who?
The Indian Princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in the Bible, so it must be true.
Is the great spirit another name for papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The great spirit made the Princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would god ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the Princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Missy:
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Kate:
Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
I can't get him!
Man 1:
Need help?
He okay?
Man 2:
He's got him.
Come on, dad!
Hang on.
Man 3:
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
Hey.
Kate:
Come on, Josh.
Come on, come on.
Mack:
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
- Come on.
Josh!
- There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen missy?
No.
You check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
You okay?
Where is she, dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emil:
Emily!
Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's missy?
I'm sorry, mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, god.
Missy!
Oh, god.
Please, god.
Officer:
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it.
Anything out of place.
You said she was there.
Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not missy's?
Mack:
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
Yeah.
Let me check this... yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
Officer over radio:
We have a possible suspect sighting.
Man in a truck near the imnaha roadblock.
Bureau is setting up base camp in Joseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Kate:
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
Kate:
I'm so sorry.
I'm here.
Kate:
I'm so sorry.
Nan:
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
They tipped over the boat.
Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Mack:
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
You're okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Officer:
We gotta go.
Mack:
Okay.
Hey, mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
What the heck is this?
What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You...
You think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox
"with no tracks in the snow,
"and it might've been signed by god"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
Nan:
Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
Hey, dad.
Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
Where's Kate?
She'll be in, in a minute.
Tried calling you this morning.
You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at ally's?
Mack:
You've seen the weather out, right?
It's only two streets away.
Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh...
Same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and...
Thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
Uh...
Think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
Mack.
Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
Well, there's no stamp.
No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack.
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's god?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
Sweetie, can you take this?
Josh:
Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
Willie:
You're not thinkin' about goin' back there, are you?
Nan:
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
No.
Man:
I told you.
MacKenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this.
To finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what nan does.
You know nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "I am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So...
Which one of you is...
All:
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Jesus:
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but you're gonna be all right, mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
You remember that smell?
Ma griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Am I dead?
Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, I didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out.
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty god, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you, she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, MacKenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
"Truth"?
Mmm.
I know that story.
You left him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it himself.
"My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"
No, mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him.
I never left you.
I never left missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something I want for you.
That's why you're here, MacKenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
You mean ally?
Mmm.
I like her.
Papa:
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
Jesus:
It's cute.
Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I did make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
All:
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.
But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
Papa:
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
Jesus:
Watch this one.
Mack:
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're god, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to papa and sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
Mack:
The last time I looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Papa:
Yes!
Papa:
Night, mack!
Missy:
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Mornin', mack.
You like Neil young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window.
Lettin' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
MacKenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way.
Just beyond the trees.
You might need these though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden
I was hoping you could help me with.
Before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
Okay, this is a mess.
It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
But this is gorgeous.
Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
Sarayu:
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me...
Or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone I care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you...
Each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing god.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So, you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake
I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Kate:
Daddy!
Daddy!
No, no, no, no, no.
Jesus:
Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
Jesus:
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Jesus:
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Jesus:
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
What?
You heard me.
This is... that's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
I can't.
Not on your own, you can't.
I'll sink.
No, mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him!
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family, to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
I thought you said you'd never leave me.
And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
Mack: "Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that god is good?
Is missy his child?
Of course.
Mack:
Then, no.
I don't think god loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
Judge you?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
What?
Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, MacKenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am I supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Mack's mother:
Leave me alone.
Come here.
What did you say?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut!
Sophia:
What about this boy?
What about him?
Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Boy:
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Missy:
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
I would damn him to hell.
And what of his father?
The man who twisted him into this deviant monster.
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about god?
Isn't he at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if he knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge god...
You must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
MacKenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I can't do this.
Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
MacKenzie, you've judged your children worthy of love,
even if it costs you everything.
Now you know papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how god can love missy
and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your god is, MacKenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not god's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow god,
evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy.
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
Mack:
She okay?
Sophia:
More than you know.
Jesus:
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Mack:
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does nan or papa.
It's time to let that go.
How was it?
Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, MacKenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
I had no idea.
It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,
why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear god just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits.
Yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Mack:
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, MacKenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Jesus:
Here we are.
This is it?
Sarayu:
To your eyes.
Just for tonight, we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
Mack:
What are those?
Sarayu:
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father I could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Let's go home.
Man:
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
Where we going?
Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt...
Like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
What he did...
Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you.
Robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
MacKenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's bring missy home.
Mack:
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, MacKenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
Here you go.
Thanks.
MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind.
But only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, mack, or forgive...
With every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Papa:
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back,
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
Jesus:
I love you, mack.
Willie:
Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Mack:
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Mack:
Where's papa?
I'll go get the doctor and the family.
Okay.
Mack:
Willie...
She was there.
Who, mack?
Was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
Hey, hey, settle down.
And nan.
And Josh.
I gotta tell 'em.
They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
I was there.
Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met god.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
Mack?
Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
Mack:
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about the lake and papa.
And missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate...
None of this is your fault.
I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you'd been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
Willie:
That afternoon, mack told nan everything.
I believe you.
Willie:
Over the next few weeks, mack improved rapidly.
Willie:
I'm sure there are some who'll wonder if everything really happened the way mack recalls.
Or if any of it happened at all.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
But the changes I see every day in my friend are evidence enough for me.
Mack:
Hey.
Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
You bring a pole for me?
Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.
Willie:
The great sadness is gone.
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
He loves larger than most.
He's quick to forgive.
And even quicker to ask forgiveness.
Josh:
Dad.
Willie:
He has become a child again.
All right!
Whoo!
Willie:
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
And it wouldn't surprise me if, every now and then, mack takes off his shoes.
Just to see if...
Well, you know.
Willie:

Leave him alone.
Willie:

Yeah.

Mack!
I just took an apple pie out of the oven.
Come have a slice.
No thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to god.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
Willie:
That Sunday, whenthepreachercalled heknewhe couldn't staysilentanylonger.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just tell him what you're sorry for.
I can't make him stop.
I try, but when he drinks, he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Mack's dad:
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
"Obey your parents in everything,
"for this pleases the lord."
Louder!
Colossians 3:20!
"Obey your parents in everything,
"for this pleases the lord!"
Willie:

Actually, if we get outta here in the next three minutes, we might make it on time.
Kids?
Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
Josh!
Jo...
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
He's trying to impress ally Taylor.
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
Who's ally?
Well, I don't care who it is, if she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if god is always with us, why does he care if we're late for church?
She's got a point.
Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
Hi, guys.
Nan:
Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do i control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.
Willie:
I met mack atchurch10 yearsago .

Mack:
No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, i guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, nan left me food in the fridge.
Maybe next time.
All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Kate:
Hey, dad.
Dad?
Mack:
Hmm?
Kate:
Dad, catch.
Mack:
There's no room.
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your dad's mothering skills.
Kate:
You do?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
My insect collection.
Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
No, daddy.
No?
This is Dixie and Donna the carpet beetles.
Wanda the walking stick.
And that's Carl the caterpillar.
"Carl the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl the caterpillar behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
Sure.
Cool.
We gotta go.
Hey, a little Patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Cheese?
Nan:
Okay.
Good-looking bunch.
Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
Let's go see the waterfall.
No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told missy the story of the Indian Princess?
What Princess?
Come on, dad, you have to.
You have to tell her the story.
We have to go back.
Please!
We can't go back.
We can't just keep pulling off every exit.
Come on.
The answer is no.
Mack:
A long time ago, there was an Indian Princess.
Missy:
What did she look like?
Mack:
Well, she was very pretty.
Missy:
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you this story?
Okay.
Well, this Princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the Princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The great spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how multnomah falls was created.
Ready to go?
Shotgun.
A little Patience, please.
You got that off your mommy, didn't ya?
Mack:
Careful near the water.
Kate:
Okay, dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
I'm mack.
Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
Those two yours?
They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, i suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
That sounds good.
Great!
I'll see you later.
mack:
You have a nice family.
Emil:
Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for god.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but kids love it.
Daddy.
I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Missy:
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
Yeah.
How come she had to die?
Who?
The Indian Princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in the Bible, so it must be true.
Is the great spirit another name for papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The great spirit made the Princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would god ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the Princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Missy:
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Ah.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Kate:
Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
I can't get him!
Man 1:
Need help?
He okay?
Man 2:
He's got him.
Come on, dad!
Hang on.
Man 3:
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
Hey.
Kate:
Come on, Josh.
Come on, come on.
Mack:
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
- Come on.
Josh!
- There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen missy?
No.
You check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
You okay?
Where is she, dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emil:
Emily!
Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's missy?
I'm sorry, mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
Oh, god.
Missy!
Oh, god.
Please, god.
Officer:
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it.
Anything out of place.
You said she was there.
Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not missy's?
Mack:
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
Yeah.
Let me check this... yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
Um, I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
Officer over radio:
We have apossiblesuspectsighting.
Maninatruck neartheimnaharoadblock.
Bureauissettingupbase camp inJoseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Kate:
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
Kate:
I'm so sorry.
I'm here.
Kate:
I'm so sorry.
Nan:
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
They tipped over the boat.
Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Mack:
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
You're okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Officer:
We gotta go.
Mack:
Okay.
Hey, mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
What the heck is this?
What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You...
You think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox
"with no tracks in the snow,
"and it might've been signed by god"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
Nan:
Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
Hey, dad.
Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
Where's Kate?
She'll be in, in a minute.
Tried calling you this morning.
You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at ally's?
Mack:
You've seen the weather out, right?
It's only two streets away.
Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Uh...
Same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and...
Thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
Uh...
Think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
Mack.
Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
Well, there's no stamp.
No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack.
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's god?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
Sweetie, can you take this?
Josh:
Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
Willie:
You'renotthinkin'about goin'backthere,are you ?
Nan:
Idon'twannaloseyou, too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here, huh?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
No.
Man:
I told you.
MacKenzie Allen Phillips.
Mmm-mmm!
Mmm...
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this.
To finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what nan does.
You know nan?
Oh, yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "i am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So...
Which one of you is...
All:
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Jesus:
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but you're gonna be all right, mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
You remember that smell?
Ma griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Am I dead?
Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, i didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out.
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Mmm-hmm.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
Hmm.
You're the almighty god, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you, she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, MacKenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
"Truth"?
Mmm.
I know that story.
You left him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it himself.
"My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"
No, mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him.
I never left you.
I never left missy.
Mmm.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something i want for you.
That's why you're here, MacKenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
You mean ally?
Mmm.
I like her.
Papa:
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
Jesus:
It's cute.
Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We, um...
We used to be close, but...
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I did make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
All:
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.
But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
Papa:
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
Jesus:
Watch this one.
Mack:
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're god, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to papa and sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
Elousia is not what I expected at all.
And sarayu, oh, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
Mack:
The last time i looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Papa:
Yes!
Papa:
Night, mack!
Missy:
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
morning', mack.
You like Neil young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window.
Lettin' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
MacKenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way.
Just beyond the trees.
You might need these though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden
I was hoping you could help me with.
Before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
Okay, this is a mess.
It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
But this is gorgeous.
Uh-huh.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
Uh-huh.
Sarayu:
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me...
Or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone i care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you...
Each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing god.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So, you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive, huh?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, uh, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake
I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Kate:
Daddy!
Daddy!
No, no, no, no, no.
Jesus:
Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
Jesus:
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Jesus:
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Jesus:
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Look at me!
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
What?
You heard me.
This is... that's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
I can't.
Not on your own, you can't.
I'll sink.
No, mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him!
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family, to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
Mmm-mmm.
This is a path only you can take.
I thought you said you'd never leave me.
And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
Mack: "Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that god is good?
Is missy his child?
Of course.
Mack:
Then, no.
I don't think god loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
Judge you?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you have something to confess?
Oh, you know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
What?
Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, MacKenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am i supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Mack's mother:
Leave me alone.
Comehere.
Whatdidyousay ?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
Andyou'regonna keepyourmouthshut!
Sophia:
What about this boy?
What about him?
Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Boy:
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Missy:
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
I would damn him to hell.
And what of his father?
The man who twisted him into this deviant monster.
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about god?
Isn't he at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if he knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge god...
You must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
MacKenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I can't do this.
Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
MacKenzie, you've judged your children worthy of love,
even if it costs you everything.
Now you know papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how god can love missy
and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your god is, MacKenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not god's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow god,
evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy.
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
Mack:
She okay?
Sophia:
More than you know.
Jesus:
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Mack:
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does nan or papa.
It's time to let that go.
How was it?
Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
Oh.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, MacKenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
I had no idea.
It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
Hmm?
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And missy's a special girl.
Oh, yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean i orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,
why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear god just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits.
Yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Mack:
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, MacKenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Jesus:
Here we are.
This is it?
Sarayu:
To your eyes.
Just for tonight, we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
Mack:
What are those?
Sarayu:
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father i could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Let's go home.
Man:
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Oh, always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
Where we going?
Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
Mmm-hmm.
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt...
Like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
What he did...
Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you.
Robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
MacKenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's bring missy home.
Mack:
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, MacKenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
Here you go.
Thanks.
MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind.
But only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, mack, or forgive...
With every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
Papa:
Mmm.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back,
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
Jesus:
I love you, mack.
Willie:
Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Mack:
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Mack:
Where's papa?
I'll go get the doctor and the family.
Okay.
Mack:
Willie...
She was there.
Who, mack?
Was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
Hey, hey, settle down.
And nan.
And Josh.
I gotta tell 'em.
They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
I was there.
Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met god.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
Mack?
Rest.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, you're okay.
Mack:
I'm sorry.
About everything.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about the lake and papa.
And missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate...
None of this is your fault.
I...
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you'd been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
Willie:

He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
You bring a pole for me?
Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
Oh, you're on.

Come have a slice.
No thanks.
That wasn't a question.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Look at me, baby.
Daddies aren't supposed to do that to their kids.
It ain't love.
You understand?
What do I do?
Talk to god.
He's always listening.
Sing with me, as those who feel led make their way to the altar.
ThatSunday, whenthepreachercalled heknewhe couldn't staysilentanylonger.

That's all right.
Just tell him what you're sorry for.
I can't make him stop.
I try, but when he drinks, he beats my mom.
I try to protect her.
But I can't!
Mack's dad:
Why do you make me do this, boy?
Why do you embarrass me in front of my people?
Say it.
Say it!
"Obey your parents in everything,

Missy, hold still for one second.
Pause!
Pause!
Okay.
Never mind, forget it.
Josh!
Jo...
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Why?
Well...
Nan, there's something wrong with Josh.
He's combed his hair and he smells nice.
He's trying to impress ally Taylor.
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
Who's ally?
Well, I don't care who it is, if she gets us there on time, she's got my blessing.
But if god is always with us, why does he care if we're late for church?
She's got a point.
Yeah.
God cares because your mama cares.
Okay, come on.
It was a nice try, you little rascal.
Good morning.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Mack, did you catch the game last night?
Since when do i control the remote?
I hear one day you get it back.
You know, crazy thing is, I'm starting to like her shows.

No, you can't drive, it's too dangerous.
No, I haven't seen anything like it.
Yeah, of course I'll be fine.
I'll heat up that rice thing.
Just a little tired, i guess.
I was gonna clear up the driveway before dark.
Call me in the morning.
Yeah, you, too.
I ain't seen a storm like this in 30 years.
It's a good thing nan and the kids are off the roads.
You want some help over there?
Grab my shovel.
Knock it out in no time.
I'm okay.
Shouldn't take too long.
Thanks for the gas.
How about some dinner tonight?
Maggie made chicken pot pie.
Nah, nan left me food in the fridge.
Maybe next time.
All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Hey,dad.
Dad?
Dad, catch.
There's no room.
Hey.
You might wanna put this somewhere where you can find it.
First aid.
If we get stung by bees, we'll use river mud, right, Josh?
Yeah.
Mom, are you sure you can't get out of your seminar?
Come on, come on, you guys are gonna have a great time.
I have faith in your dad's mothering skills.
You do?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, young lady, what have you got there?
My insect collection.
Your what?
Hey, are you packing bugs?
No, daddy.
No?
This is Dixie and Donna the carpet beetles.
Wanda the walking stick.
And that's Carl the caterpillar.
"Carl the caterpillar." I like it.
Can I take them?
Please?
We can't leave Carl the caterpillar behind.
Not a good idea.
No.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Summer's last hurrah?
It's gonna be an awful lonely weekend around here.
I'll bring you back a six-pound brown.
All right.
None of that store-bought stuff.
I can tell the difference.
Hey, Willie, have you got a moment?
Sure.
Cool.
We gotta go.
Hey, a little Patience, please.
Kids?
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Cheese?
Okay.
Good-looking bunch.
Sure?
Okay!
Get outta here!
Goodbye!
Hey, kids, look there.
Remember?
The falls.
Daddy, we have to stop!
Let's go see the waterfall.
No stopping.
We gotta get to the campground before dark.
Well, have you told missy the story of the Indian Princess?
What Princess?
Come on, dad, you have to.
You have to tell her the story.
We have to go back.
Please!
We can't go back.
We can't just keep pulling off every exit.
Come on.
The answer is no.
A long time ago, there was an Indian Princess.
What did she look like?
Well, she was very pretty.
What color was her hair?
Like this.
Do you want me to tell you this story?
Okay.
Well, this Princess was the only daughter of the eldest chief.
And he was the leader of a great tribe.
Till one summer, a terrible sickness spread through the land.
It was so fierce even the strongest warriors fell ill.
They were on the verge of death.
So, all the chiefs met to see what they could do.
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.
The illness could only be stopped if the daughter of a chief gave up her life for her people.
After a long debate, they knew they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.
And the Princess, when she heard about this prophecy, she knew what she had to do, 'cause she loved her people so much.
One morning, she climbed up to those rocks.
And without hesitation, she jumped.
The next morning, a great healing came over the tribe.
The sick began to rise from their beds.
Everyone rejoiced.
But the chief knew that his daughter was missing.
He knew what she had done.
His heart broke.
His tears rolled down his cheek.
He cried out, asking for his daughter's sacrifice to be remembered.
The great spirit was so moved by his tears that he answered his prayers.
Water began to fall.
Right there.
That's how multnomah falls was created.
Ready to go?
Shotgun.
A little Patience, please.
You got that off your mommy, didn't ya?
Careful near the water.
Okay, dad, sure.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that.
There we go.
I'm mack.
Emil.
That's my wife, Vicki.
Those two yours?
They are.
Seem to be getting on.
Yeah, well, i suppose we should, too, or this whole thing's gonna get awkward.
Hey, listen, we're just camped right up here if you wanna come by later, help us light some marshmallows on fire.
That sounds good.
Great!
I'll see you later.
You have a nice family.
Emil:
Thank you.
You as well.
Daddy, we need to say our prayers to papa.
I'll be right there.
"Papa"?
Yeah, it's my wife's nickname for god.
I like that.
It is a little too familiar for my taste, but kids love it.
Daddy.
I'll be back.
Do you know what my mom used to tell me?
She said when a star twinkles, a prayer is heard in heaven.
Wow.
Papa sure is busy.
Yeah.
How come she had to die?
Who?
The Indian Princess.
Well, I don't think she had to.
I think she chose to.
What she did saved her people.
Is it a true story?
It might be.
Sometimes legends come from true stories.
But Jesus dying isn't a legend.
It's in the Bible, so it must be true.
Is the great spirit another name for papa?
He is a spirit.
And he is great.
Right?
Then how come he's so mean?
Why'd you say that?
The great spirit made the Princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.
Don't you think that's mean?
I'll tell you what.
When we get home, your mom will have a good answer for you.
Daddy, will I ever have to jump off a cliff?
No.
No, honey.
You will never have to jump off a cliff.
Would god ask me to?
No.
He won't ask you that, either.
Okay.
Good night, daddy.
Good night.
She asks good questions, doesn't she?
Yeah, she sure does.
She's a special girl.
You both are.
Thanks.
Love you, dad.
I love you.
Get some sleep.
Missy, it's time you start packing up.
Do you think the Princess should have red boots or blue?
Time to come in!
Daddy, red or blue?
What else is she wearing?
She's wearing a red dress like mine.
Then red it is.
It's beautiful, honey.
Daddy!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad!
He's stuck!
I can't get him!
Josh!
Josh!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, he's stuck!
Dad!
Josh!
Dad, where's Josh?
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?
I can't get him!
Need help?
He okay?
He's got him.
Come on, dad!
Hang on.
Man 3:
Go, go, go.
Get his right side.
Hey.
Come on, Josh.
Come on, come on.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on!
Come on, son.
- Come on.
Josh!
- There we go.
There we go.
That's it.
Missy!
Hey, you can come out, honey.
Everyone's fine now.
Emil, have you seen missy?
No.
You check your camp?
Yeah.
She's probably with my girls.
You okay?
Where is she, dad?
She'll be here somewhere.
We'll find her.
Okay?
Not here.
My girls are gone, too.
Check those bathrooms and showers, and I'll check those.
All right.
Missy!
Emil:
Emily!
Sorry, have you seen a little girl?
I didn't see anybody.
Missy?
Vicki!
I found them.
Where's missy?
I'm sorry, mack, they haven't seen her.
Missy!
God.
Missy!
God.
Please, god.
Officer:
We need to know if there's anything different from the way you remember it.
Anything out of place.
You said she was there.
Yeah.
What's that?
That ladybug, that pin.
That's not missy's?
No.
Definitely not.
I think it's probably one of two places, fellas.
I think it's either the lake or the mountain.
Yeah.
Let me check this... yeah.
Can someone please tell me what's going on?
I'm really sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Apparently, there's a guy the feds have been pursuing for years.
They think he's responsible for abducting at least five young girls.
Do you think he took my missy?
We don't know anything for sure.
Wehave apossiblesuspectsighting.
Maninatruck neartheimnaharoadblock.
Bureauissettingupbase camp inJoseph.
Over.
Tell him we'll be there within the hour.
Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.
Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your missy.
We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Took my eyes off of her just for a second.
They tipped over the boat.
Shh.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Mack.
Sweetie, it's not your fault.
Mr. Phillips?
Sir?
Ground teams found the truck in the mountains.
Okay.
Chopper's waiting, sir.
Mack, you okay?
You're okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Officer:
We gotta go.
Okay.
Hey, mack.
We're just sitting down for dinner.
What the heck is this?
What?
Some kind of sick joke?
You...
You think I wrote this?
Mentions the shack.
Signed "papa."
Who else knows that?
Mack, I would never kid about that.
Now, where'd you get it?
It was in my mailbox.
Somebody put it there.
Who would stoop this low?
Should we call the police?
Call the police?
Yeah, and say what?
"A letter showed up in my mailbox
"with no tracks in the snow,
"and it might've been signed by god"?
There were no tracks?
Just forget it.
Mack...
Mack!
Mack!
Hey!
We're home!
Hey, dad.
Hey, champ.
You okay?
Yeah, I just slipped on the ice last night.
Let me see.
It's fine.
It's just a little bump.
What's that?
It's just a work thing.
Where's Kate?
She'll be in, in a minute.
Tried calling you this morning.
You did?
Must've really been out.
Hey, dad.
Dad?
Can I go finish my homework at ally's?
You've seen the weather out, right?
It's only two streets away.
Another time.
Hey, you.
Hey.
What?
I just wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Can I go?
Yeah.
How was she at Arlene's?
Same as always.
She comes out of her shell for a minute, and then retreats.
So I'm gonna take her to my brother's this weekend.
He knows a counselor that we could try, and...
Thought maybe you could join us.
I'm pretty sure that's the last thing that she'd want.
Think it's best if it's just you guys.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.
Mack.
Yeah?
Don't forget we love each other.
And you don't know anything about it?
Well, there's no stamp.
No.
Well, if it's not stamped, it's not delivered.
Well, you want your mail while you're here?
What do you need a four-wheel drive for?
Mack.
Come on.
We been friends for a long time.
Just shoot straight with me.
Is this about that note?
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?
Well...
Have you talked with nan about this at all?
No, I don't want to upset her.
She's barely holding it together right now.
Have you prayed about it?
I just want your truck.
But you know this isn't a good idea, right?
I mean, what if it is that guy?
And then he's trying to get you out there for who knows what reason.
We don't know that yet.
You already think about the other possibility?
What?
You think it's god?
You're the one who said there were no tracks in the snow.
Well, maybe it'd been out there for a few days and I didn't see it.
I don't know.
It's completely crazy.
But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.
Okay.
But I'm gonna go with you.
Sure, fine.
I hope it goes well with her.
Yeah.
I hope it goes well with you, too.
Sweetie, can you take this?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Text me when you get there?
Look...
I know that you are wrestling with something.
And it's okay if you don't know how to talk about it.
It's just that we've lost so much already.
I don't wanna lose you, too.
Okay?
Tent.
Bags.
Food.
Coleman lantern.
Snowshoes.
Just in case.
Where's your pole?
I didn't know we were goin' fishin'.
We should probably have something to do when we finally figure out I've lost my mind.
All right.
I'll grab my stuff.
You'renotthinkin'about goin'backthere,are you ?
Nan:
Idon'twannaloseyou, too.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Come on out.
You couldn't even let us have her body buried properly.
You coward.
Why?
God!
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
You led me here.
Now you don't have the guts to show.
Some papa you are.
Pretty chilly out here?
Got a fire goin' inside, if you wanna warm up.
Come on, mack.
I know someone who'd love to see you.
No.
I told you.
MacKenzie Allen Phillips.
My, my, my.
Look at you.
Do I know you?
Not very well.
But we can work on that.
I've been so lookin' forward to this.
To finally see you face to face.
Can I take your coat?
And that gun.
We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, now would we?
I understand.
It's confusing.
We all do.
You will do this on your terms and time.
How about some introductions?
I'm Elousia.
I have a lot of names, but that's one of my favorites.
Or, if you want, you can call me what nan does.
You know nan?
Yes.
Very well.
Are you saying that you're...
I am.
The "i am"?
I am that I am.
Look at that.
Already quoting' scripture.
And you've met my son.
Great to see you, mack.
Your son?
Of course.
And I'm sarayu.
Sarah who?
Sarayu.
It means "a breath of wind."
Right.
So...
Which one of you is...
I am.
And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's okay, baby.
Let it go.
We all collect things we value, don't we?
I collect tears.
Right.
It's good to meet you guys.
I'll be right back.
Why'd I have to wake up?
Think you dropped this.
You wrote this?
We're so happy you accepted our invitation.
This is nuts.
What am I doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You're free to do whatever you like.
You can go fishing.
Or hiking.
Help sarayu in the garden.
Or you can go talk to papa in the kitchen.
Your choice.
I know this is overwhelming, but you're gonna be all right, mack.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.
Okay.
You remember that smell?
Ma griffe.
Your mother's perfume.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.
Am I dead?
Do you feel dead?
You knew I would come, didn't you?
Course I did.
Was I free not to come?
I'm not interested in prisoners.
You're free to walk out that door right now.
Why did you bring me back here?
Because here's where you got stuck.
You're wearing a dress.
Excuse me?
I always pictured you with a white beard.
I think that's Santa.
After what you been through, i didn't think you could handle a father right now.
Here.
Make yourself useful.
Press out.
Fold back.
Rotate.
All there is to it.
I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.
You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
There is no easy answer that'll take your pain away.
No instant fix that's enduring.
Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.
"Relationship"?
You're the almighty god, right?
You know everything.
You're everywhere, all at once.
And you have limitless power.
Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.
When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
I never left her.
If you are who you say you are...
Where were you when I needed you?
Son...
When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.
Stop talking in riddles.
How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?
Because of you, she's gone.
Unless you can change that,
I will never be free.
The truth sets everyone free, MacKenzie.
And the truth has a name.
He's over in his woodshed right now, covered in sawdust.
"Truth"?
I know that story.
You left him, too.
Seems like you have a bad habit of turning your back on those you supposedly love.
I'm not who you think I am.
He said it himself.
"My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"
No, mack.
You misunderstand the mystery.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.
Love always leaves a mark.
We were there together.
I never left him.
I never left you.
I never left missy.
He's a beauty, isn't he?
Created to fly.
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.
Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings.
Pain has a way of doing that to us.
If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.
That's not something i want for you.
That's why you're here, MacKenzie.
This is your flying lesson.
Dinner's almost ready.
So Josh has a girlfriend now?
You mean ally?
I like her.
Me, too.
I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.
It's cute.
Yeah.
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.
You think?
How's Kate doin'?
We...
We used to be close, but...
My god.
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to...
No.
It's okay.
I did make it.
It is good.
That was the best meal I've had.
Ever.
Dreaming or otherwise.
Thank you.
Let me ask you somethin'.
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.
But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?
Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.
We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.
I'll wash, you dry?
I'll take this round.
Why don't you show mack some of your handiwork?
Wanna take a look?
Okay.
Watch this one.
Incredible.
I get that you're all connected.
But I feel way more relaxed around you.
That's probably because I'm human.
But you're god, too, right?
I'm the best way any human can relate to papa and sarayu.
To see me is to see them.
You're all so different.
c is not what I expected at all.
And sarayu, geez.
Sarayu is creativity.
Action.
The breath of life.
She is my spirit.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.
That's all we wanna have with you.
Even if you can't see it.
You are in the center of our love and purpose.
As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The last time i looked at stars like this, she was lying next to me.
I know.
Yes!
Night, mack!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Missy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
morning', mack.
You like Neil young?
I am especially fond of him.
How'd you sleep, baby?
Fine.
You know, dreams are important.
They can be a way of opening' a window.
Lettin' the bad air out.
Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?
Nope.
Haven't been able to find any.
Guess that's just the way I am.
Don't you get mad at 'em?
Well, sure.
But what parent doesn't?
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?
My what?
Your wrath.
You lost me there.
Come on.
Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Nope.
I don't need to punish people.
Sin is its own punishment.
As difficult as it is for you to accept,
I'm in the middle of everything you perceive to be a mess, workin' for your good.
That's what I do.
How can you say that?
After all the pain and suffering in the world, what possible good comes from a little girl being murdered by a sick monster?
See, you may not cause those things, but you certainly don't stop 'em.
MacKenzie, you're trying to make sense of your world based on a very incomplete picture.
It's like looking through the knothole of your pain.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.
I am!
And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.
And then you would trust me.
Trust you?
Why would I do that?
My daughter is dead.
And there's nothing you can say that will ever justify what happened to her.
Looking for the way out?
If you are looking for your truck, it's up that way.
Just beyond the trees.
You might need these though.
Thanks.
Just to be clear, we're not justifying anything.
We'd like to heal it, if you'd let us.
Before you go, there's something in the garden
I was hoping you could help me with.
Before tomorrow's celebration.
What celebration?
If you wanna know, you'll stick around.
Wow.
Well, this is wild.
That isn't the word in your head.
Okay, this is a mess.
It is, isn't it?
So beautiful.
There's something very special I want to plant here tomorrow.
To prepare the ground, we have to dig up all the roots, or they'll return and harm the new growth.
But this is gorgeous.
You can start over there.
Okay.
Careful.
That one's deadly.
What's it doing here if it's poisonous?
You're presuming that poison is bad.
On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
But combine it with the nectar from this flower, and suddenly it contains incredible healing properties.
Let me ask you, how confident are you in your ability to discern good from evil?
Usually pretty obvious.
And your basis for something being good is what?
Well, if it helps me...
Or the people that I love.
And evil?
It's harmful.
If it hurts someone i care about.
So, pretty much, you are the judge?
Yeah, I guess.
You ever been wrong?
Or changed your opinion over time?
I mean, sure.
And there are billions like you...
Each determining what you think is good and evil.
And when your good clashes with your neighbor's evil, arguments ensue.
Wars break out.
Because all insist on playing god.
You weren't meant to do any of that.
All on your own.
This was always meant to be a conversation between friends.
What do you think?
It's still a mess.
Yes, it is, mack.
Wild, wonderful, and perfectly in process.
This mess is you.
So, you decided to stay.
Thinking about it.
Sarayu can be very persuasive?
If only I was smart enough to understand a word she said.
So, if you're up for a walk, there's something on the far side of the lake
I'd like to show you.
I just have to finish up in the shed, and I'll meet you down there.
You can take the boat out, if you want.
Left my pole in it, if you're feeling lucky.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No, no, no, no, no.
Mack!
Mack, it's okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't me.
You told me to come out here.
Mack, this is happening inside you.
You're letting it consume you, and you don't have to.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just take a deep breath and listen to my voice.
Don't look at it, mack.
Look here.
Missy!
Don't think about the past.
Don't think about the pain.
Look at me.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Trust me, none of this can hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Breathe.
Good, mack.
I'm not going anywhere.
Now, let's get you out of this boat.
What?
You heard me.
This is... that's not funny.
I'm not joking.
You can do this.
I can't.
Not on your own, you can't.
I'll sink.
No, mack.
You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.
I promised to go with you always, right?
And I'm right here.
Come on.
All right.
Here we go.
This is insane.
Now what?
Just start walking.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
How are you doing?
I'm still freakin' out.
Looks like we've got company.
Look at this.
Look!
See him!
What a beauty!
Must be over two feet long.
Been trying to catch him for weeks.
Why don't you just command him to bite your hook?
Where's the fun in that?
You know, you don't really fit all the religious stuff that I was taught.
Religion.
Religion's way too much work.
I don't want slaves.
I want friends, family, to share life with.
What about following the rules and working to be a good Christian?
Think about it, mack.
I'm not exactly what you call a Christian, now am I?
No, I guess you're not.
I don't care what you call them.
I just wanna see people changed by knowing papa.
To feel what it's like to be truly loved.
I don't think I've ever felt that.
Put your shoes back on.
I'll show you how you can.
Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.
You're not comin'?
This is a path only you can take.
I thought you said you'd never leave me.
And I meant it.
Trust me.
Don't forget what you've learned.
I'll be waiting for you right here.
"Keep going."
Hello?
Anyone?
Sorry, I...
You are?
I am wisdom.
Do you understand why you're here?
Not really.
But I'm kinda getting used to that.
Today's a serious day, with serious consequences.
You're here for judgment.
"Judgment"?
They said I wasn't dead.
You're not.
Then what is this?
You don't believe that god is good?
Is missy his child?
Of course.
Then, no.
I don't think god loves his children very well.
If that's what you believe...
Come.
Sit.
You can judge me fine from there.
Judge you?
Do you have something to confess?
You know what I did.
Yes.
But you're not the one on trial.
Today, you are the judge.
What?
Why are you surprised?
You spent your whole life judging nearly everyone and everything, their actions and motivations.
As if you could even know them.
You make snap judgments just by the color of someone's skin.
Their clothes.
Their body language.
By all accounts, you're a well-practiced expert, MacKenzie.
Sit.
All right.
So, who am i supposed to judge?
There must be at least a few who are to blame for all the pain and suffering in the world.
Right?
Right.
What about the selfish?
The greedy?
Those who harm others?
Murderers?
Drug dealers?
Terrorists?
Guilty?
Yeah.
What about men who beat their wives?
Mack's mother:
Leave me alone.
Comehere.
Whatdidyousay ?
Or fathers who beat their sons to alleviate their own suffering?
Let's not do this.
Should that man be judged?
Yeah.
Andyou'regonna keepyourmouthshut!
Sophia:
What about this boy?
What about him?
Would you judge him?
He's a kid.
But you already have.
That boy is your father.
Boy:
Yes, sir.
Now, what about the man who preys on innocent little girls?
Daddy!
Daddy!
Okay, that's enough.
Is that man guilty?
I would damn him to hell.
And what of his father?
The man who twisted him into this deviant monster.
I would damn him, too.
How can you stop there?
Doesn't the legacy of brokenness go all the way back to Adam?
And what about god?
Isn't he at fault?
He set all this in motion.
Especially, if he knew the outcome.
Do you want me to say it?
Absolutely.
God is to blame.
Well, if it's so easy for you to judge god...
You must choose one of your children to spend eternity in heaven.
The other will go to hell.
I can't do...
Can't do what?
I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.
So, who will go to hell?
You could choose Kate.
She said some pretty hurtful things.
She shuts you out.
You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
Or you could choose Josh.
He's been disobedient.
Sneaking out.
Lying to you.
You didn't know that?
MacKenzie, make your choice.
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I can't do this.
Can't do what?
I can't.
I won't.
You must.
This isn't a game.
You have to.
You know what?
This isn't fair.
You must.
It isn't fair.
I can't.
Take me.
I'll go instead of them.
I'll take their place.
You take me.
I'll go in their place.
You leave my kids alone, and you take me!
MacKenzie, you've judged your children worthy of love,
even if it costs you everything.
Now you know papa's heart.
You know, what I don't understand is how god can love missy
and put her through so much horror.
She was innocent.
I know.
Did he use her to punish me?
'Cause that's not fair.
And she didn't deserve it.
My wife and my children didn't deserve it.
Now, I might.
'Cause you know I'm...
Is that who your god is, MacKenzie?
No wonder you're drowning in great sorrow.
God isn't like that.
This was not god's doing.
He didn't stop it.
He doesn't stop a lot of things that cause him pain.
What happened to missy was the work of evil.
And no one in your world is immune from it.
You want the promise of a pain-free life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There isn't one.
As long as there is another will in this universe, free not to follow god,
evil can find a way in.
There's gotta be a better way.
And there is.
But the better way involves trust.
I don't wanna be the judge anymore.
Missy.
She can't hear you.
Can she see me?
No.
But she knows you're here.
She okay?
More than you know.
Missy!
Does she forgive me?
For what?
Couldn't save her.
Couldn't get to her in time.
Missy doesn't think that.
And neither does nan or papa.
It's time to let that go.
How was it?
Terrible.
And wonderful.
I'm very proud of you, my friend.
Thank you.
For letting me see her.
It wasn't my idea.
This always works better when we do it together, don't you think?
God has time to catch a few rays?
Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.
Papa...
Yes, MacKenzie?
I've been pretty hard on you.
Sorry.
I had no idea.
It's okay.
It's in the past now, where it belongs.
Maybe we can start growing together without it.
I'd like that.
Thank you for letting me see missy.
It was entirely my pleasure.
I can't begin to describe the joy it gave me to see you two together.
And missy's a special girl.
Yeah.
You understand now.
I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.
But that doesn't mean i orchestrate the tragedies.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,
why would you keep working on me?
Because that's what love does.
I don't really understand relationships, do I?
But you still love me anyway.
Men.
Such idiots sometimes.
Did I hear god just call me an idiot?
If the shoe fits.
Yes, sir.
If the shoe fits.
Freshen up, mack.
Got a big night ahead.
Someone gonna tell me where we're goin'?
Look around, MacKenzie.
Don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Here we are.
This is it?
Sarayu:
To your eyes.
Just for tonight, we'd love for you to get a glimpse of what we see.
Okay.
What are those?
Sarayu:
Not "what".
Who.
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.
What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
What's happening with that one?
Why is he focused on us?
He's focused on you.
Is that...
Dad.
Mack, I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I was blind, and I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see anyone.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
Son, I forgive you.
You've become the father i could never be.
And I'm so proud of you.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'll see you again, son.
Let's go home.
Mack.
Wake up.
It's time for us to go.
Papa?
Good morning, son.
You're messin' with me, aren't ya?
Always.
For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.
Where we going?
Almost there.
We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
Please, don't.
Son, we're on a healing trail to bring closure to this part of your journey.
You want me to forgive him?
He killed my daughter.
I wanna hurt him.
I want him to hurt...
Like he hurt me.
I want you to hurt him.
I know you do.
But he, too, is my son.
And I want to redeem him.
"Redeem him"?
He should burn in hell.
So, we're back to you as the judge?
So, you just let him get away with it?
Nobody gets away with anything.
Everything bears consequences.
What he did...
Was horrible.
I'm not asking you to excuse what he did.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.
And then what?
Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.
It's just about letting go of his throat.
Mack, the pain inside is devouring you.
Robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
I can't.
You're not stuck because you can't.
You're stuck because you won't.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here with you.
I don't know how.
Just say it out loud.
I...
I forgive...
I forgive you.
MacKenzie, you're such a joy.
I'm still angry.
Of course you are.
No one lets go all at once.
You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.
But it will.
Let's go.
Let's bring missy home.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please, please!
It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.
Those are your tears, MacKenzie.
We've been collecting them for a long time.
Here you go.
Thanks.
MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.
You can remain here with us, or go home to nan and your children.
Either way, we promise to be with you always.
What about missy?
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you go, you'll be leaving her behind.
But only for now.
Well, what does she want?
She'd love to see you today.
But she lives in a place where there's no impatience, so she doesn't mind waiting.
Everything about being here has been so remarkable.
Back home, I go to work, try to be a good person.
Love my family.
I don't know.
Does what I do really matter?
Absolutely.
Mack, you are important.
And so is everything you do.
Every time you love, mack, or forgive...
With every act of kindness, the universe changes.
For the better.
If anything matters, then everything matters.
Then I wanna go home.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?
Anything.
Kate needs you.
She blames herself for missy's death.
You had your own guilt to deal with.
But the time for blame is over.
When I go back,
I still want you in my life.
I always was.
I always am.
I always will be.
That's good.
'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I love you, mack.
Mack?
Mack?
Hey.
Mack.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You're awake.
Where am I?
You're at the hospital.
Where's papa?
I'll go get the doctor and the family.
Okay.
Willie...
She was there.
Who, mack?
Was where?
I gotta talk to Kate.
Hey, hey, settle down.
And nan.
And Josh.
I gotta tell 'em.
They're here.
Nurse just went to get 'em.
They're in the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, buddy, you were hit by a 40-ton semi.
Last night?
No, Friday.
Right after you stole my truck.
That's impossible.
I spent the weekend at the shack.
Mack, you never made it.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I made it.
I was there.
Okay.
Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?
I met god.
Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
Mack?
Rest.
Hey.
You're okay.
I'm sorry.
About everything.
It's okay.
It's okay, we can talk about it later, sweetie.
You just need to rest now.
I got so much to tell you about the lake and papa.
And missy.
She was there.
I saw her.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
She's more than okay.
She's happy.
She's beautiful.
She's so beautiful.
Hey, champ.
Hey, sweetie.
You're strong.
Thank you.
Give me and Kate a minute here.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, you.
I know things haven't been that great between us lately.
See, I was so lost in my own sadness that...
I wasn't able to help you through yours.
I'm really sorry.
Kate...
None of this is your fault.
I never should've stood up on that boat.
Look at me.
Don't think about the past.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know what it feels like to carry what you'd been carrying.
And I'm only beginning to learn how to let it go.
And I'm hopin' that this is something that we can learn to do together.
Doesn't matter what you're goin' through.
You never have to do it alone.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, dad.
I love you so much, Kate.
Thatafternoon, macktoldnaneverything.
I believe you.
Overthenextfew weeks, mack improved rapidly.
I'msure there are some who'll wonder ifeverythingreallyhappened the way mack recalls.
Orifanyofit happenedatall.
You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose.
ButthechangesIsee every day in my friend areevidenceenoughfor me.
Hey.
Willie said the bass are biting.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.
That's easy money.
You bring a pole for me?
Take your pick.
Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
You're on.
Thegreatsadnessisgone .
Mack experiences most days with a profound sense of joy.
Heloveslargerthanmost .
He'squickto forgive.
Andevenquicker toaskforgiveness.
Dad.
Hehasbecome achildagain.
All right!
Whoo!
Or maybe the child he was never allowed to be, abiding in simple trust and wonder.
Anditwouldn't surprise me if, every now and then, macktakesoffhis shoes.
Just to see if...
Well, you know.
Ah, the teachers of our youth.
They pushed us, inspired our minds, and made us who we are today.
And when those great teachers got sick, my mom stepped in to be a sub.
Bonjour, my little French fries.
By the time I'm done with you, you're going to be eating snails, not taking baths, and enjoying the silent art of mime.
Like most substitute teachers, she didn't know very much.
They're a weird people, hmm?
Then one day, everything changed.
My Mom saw the movie "Dead Poets Society."
O Captain!
My Captain!
O Captain!
My Captain!
When Robin Williams inspired those stuffy rich kids to stand on their desks, my mom saw her true calling.
Who knew Mork from Ork had such a serious side?
This movie proves that a sub is the most important person in a child's life.
Come Monday, that's just what I'm gonna do... inspire my kids.
You mean your students or your actual kids?
Both.
It's a win-win.
I'm sure they'll see it that way.
- Hey, shut up!
- You shut up!
Good morning, class.
Uh, before we get started, does anyone need to make?
Hmm?
Anyone?
There's gonna be a lot of learning today, so if you got to make, do it now.
Anyone got to make poo-poos?
Stop!
- No one has to make!
- Moving on.
All right, according to this memo from Principal Ball,
Mr. Gluckman has been checked into a rehab facility to address his relationship with cocaine.
"Please tell the students he has the flu."
Okay.
Mr. Gluckman has the flu.
I'll be your sub for the next 30 days.
- Sweet!
- A sub!
We get to waste a whole month of critical learning that'll put us behind for years to come!
No, JTP!
History has proven my mom turns awesome things to garbage!
Aw, who's that handsome fella?
- Is he single?
- This is a nightmare.
Question, Who here is familiar with the film "Dead Poets Society?"
Chill, dude.
Your mom's gonna show us a movie.
It's a classic sub move.
Oh, we're not watching it.
We're living it!
- Oh, no.
- Barry's right.
In fact, I need a volunteer chosen completely at random to come stand on my desk and view the world
- from a new perspective.
- Oh, No!
She wants us to learn by standing on furniture?
Standing on a desk was how Robin Williams inspired his students.
Unfortunately, not everyone liked to see things from a different angle.
Whoa, whoa!
There's no climbing in school!
Unless it's on a rope hung dangerously from the rafters of the gymnasium.
Dude, the hot sub told us to do it.
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?
Ho!
Look, everyone!
It's the stuffy administration coming to clip my wings!
No!
For the past 30 years,
Mr. Gluckman has sloshed corrosive chemicals all over that old desk.
It's falling apart.
I fear nothing.
Like any great teacher, I encourage my students to seize the day!
Aah!
♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪
♪ But nonetheless, I feel the need to say ♪
♪ I don't know the future ♪
♪ But the past keeps getting clearer every day ♪
It was January 4, 1980-something, the day a single text message rocked my world.
Yo.
Get this note to Goldnerd for me.
Yep, back in the '80s, this was our version of sending a text.
You'd have to pass a note the old-fashioned way, by hand.
Only problem was, your messages weren't password-protected.
Mr. Goldberg, since that little paper is more important than life-saving CPR, maybe you'd like to stand and share it with the rest of us.
"Ballsssss."
To be clear...
I did not write this.
"Dude, when did Emmy Mirsky get so dang foxy?
I mean, holy boobs, Batman!
Look at those sweatshirt puppies."
Again, I did not write this.
Oh, that sucked.
My intention was to teach you a lesson about note-passing, but instead, I just made us all feel wildly uncomfortable.
Let's just move on to Chapter 6, okay?
Female reproductive...
Nope.
Class dismissed.
Next time you get caught with a note, just do what a normal person does
- and eat it.
- Dude, you can't eat paper.
My mom says it plugs up your bottom.
Small price to pay to avoid total humiliation.
I know, right?
I had to stand up in front of everyone and talk about my best friend's, you know, stuff.
Wait.
You thought that note was embarrassing for you?
Well, who else would it embarrass?
- Me!
- Why?
The note said you were hot.
You should be happy about it.
Are you serious right now?
Dork!
Boy, you really know your way around relationships with human beings.
I agree I'm flawed, but I honestly have no idea what I said wrong here.
Okay, I'm gonna shed some light on what it's like to be a freshman girl, and it ain't gonna be pretty.
The seniors called me "Frizzica Spazzberg."
Every 9th-grade girl, no matter how she looks, feels uncomfortable in her own skin.
There's a hunk of lettuce in your braces.
How did you not feel it?
I was going through a salad phase!
My point is, Emmy just needs a friend who understands how she feels.
Seriously, though, there's like a whole head of romaine in there.
I am gonna give you one second to walk away.
1!
As I was learning how to be a better friend, my mom was teaching Barry how to be a better student.
I don't understand!
This is my house, not my school.
Now that I have the teaching tools I learned in a movie,
I will not rest until you get an "A" in this class.
Okay, now, the atomic symbol "C"
stands for what?
- Chemistry!
- Carbon.
It stands for Carbon.
But it also stands for chemistry, so half a point?
Okay.
Name three types of inert gases.
Easy.
There's regular, unleaded, and... farts?
- Farts?
- Farts.
The answer is not farts!
How is fart not a gas?
!
Science makes no sense, and I don't need it!
Especially 'cause I'm gonna marry Kathy Ireland.
- Who?
- Supermodel Kathy Ireland.
I'm gonna be her lazy mooch of a husband who lives in her mansion in Ireland!
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go brush up on my Irish culture and... find me gold at the end of the rainbow, mon.
Well, that accent was definitely Jamaican.
Boopie, don't give up!
Mama believes in you!
Question...
Why?
You're a substitute teacher.
Just give the boy a damn "A" already.
- You want me to cheat?
- Of course I do.
We got to get that moron into some sort of college.
Can you believe this, Dad?
- He thinks Barry can't do it.
- His answer was "farts."
Okay, you really want him to buckle down?
Let me go upstairs and get his ass in gear.
By yelling at him and calling him a moron?
No way.
That doesn't work.
Barry needs inspiration.
All I need to do is unlock his potential, and then the sky's the limit.
His many limits are the limit.
His answer was "farts."
That day, I was also on a mission to prove to Emmy I felt her pain.
All right, hormonal disasters!
It's time to pick teams!
Shirts, Skins, Shirts, Skins,
Okay, so why exactly did we cut math to sit in on some random gym class?
What you're witnessing is a barbaric practice known as "Shirts vs. Skins."
Nothing is worse than having to awkwardly disrobe
- in front of your bros.
- You got to be kidding me.
I know!
I mean, why not shorts vs. pants?
or red shirts vs. blue shirts?
Sure, it would take some planning the night before, but I could get a phone tree going.
I mean, we are not the same.
Do you wear thick, baggy-ass clothes when it's 90 degrees out to hide your body?
I thought you wear that 'cause you love Epcot.
I've never even been there!
Why would I love it?
'Cause it's like taking a trip around the world without leaving the safe confines of Orlando?
Being a Skin in gym is nothing compared to being stared at all day.
Well, if you think about it, my thing's actually way worse 'cause at least you get to cover up with bulky fabrics.
I get no fabrics!
None!
You're a douche lord!
Hey, Bar, how's studying with Mom going?
Rad as all get-out.
Only took two minutes to finish all of my homework.
She's really teaching you science stuff?
Let's just say Mom is gonna be very pleased with my answers.
Pops, give us a taste.
Question 1.
"What is the chemical symbol for sodium?"
And my answer?
"My mommy is the best mommy ever of all mommies on Planet Mommy."
Nailed it!
What the hell are you doing, you moron?
Just giving the lady the answers she always wanted to hear.
Pops, what's the atomic weight of chloride?
"Wittle Barry-wary like Mummy's snuggy-wuggies."
Okay, this is just nonsense.
And with that, my dad knew it was time to inspire Barry in his own way.
Look, I hate to tell you this, but your mom is looking for any excuse to fail you.
What?
Why?
Mom telling you to study is just a trick, because she knows you never do what she says.
I do don't do that!
She really wants you to fail so you don't graduate.
And no college means you live here forever.
And that means she picks out your clothes for the rest of your life.
But I want Kathy Ireland to pick out my clothes for the rest of my life.
Well, I hope she enjoys sharing a family bathroom.
No!
She likes sushi and smoothies and Malibu!
I don't know what to tell you.
Mom will not control me.
I will learn all chemistry...
No, all science!
- Mom says you won't.
- Oh, I will.
Time for me to tear off this plastic shrink-wrap and get to learning.
But the year is half-over.
And that, my friend, is how you truly inspire a kid.
All you did was use his mother as a weapon to rile him up.
I do it all the time.
It's how I got Erica to learn piano,
Adam to ice skate.
I just tell them that their mom is holding them back.
You do know that if Bev finds out about this, she'll never forgive you.
No doubt.
Aw, screw it.
You did what you had to do.
It had been days since Emmy talked to me, so I decided to recruit someone who spoke her language.
Okay, before you throw a hard object at me
- and say "Get out"...
- Get out!
I have a big favor to ask and will pay a huge sum of money to do it.
I'm listening.
I need you to give this note to Emmy and make her read it.
She's still not talking to you, huh?
Honestly, she's being crazy and irrational, but as you can see in this note,
I'm the bigger man and still willing to apologize.
"Dear Emmy, you're being crazy and irrational.
Let me explain the many reasons why your super-silly female body issues are all in your head." No.
Fine!
Then...
Then you fix it.
Exactly how much money are we talking here?
$1,000.
Which is what this Megatron will be worth on the black market in 30 years.
- I'll do it for 20 bucks.
- 5 bucks and a Skeletor?
I'll do it if you just go away now.
And so my sister would help me, but not by going to Emmy.
Hey, Coach.
Got a minute?
Kind of busy, female Goldberg.
I'm inventing a new hybrid sport.
Either, uh, baseball fencing or water-polo squash.
You can't play squash under water.
- People need to breathe.
- Need to breathe.
That makes sense.
"Need... to... breathe".
Uh-huh.
So, my brother's been a bad friend to Emmy Mirsky.
Ah, stabbed in the back by her best amigo.
That is a crime worse than all the murders in the world.
I don't think that's right, but sure.
So, could you help her by blatantly abusing your authority?
You want old Coach to exact sweet revenge, huh?
No problem.
- You're an amazing teacher.
- I'm sure of it.
While Erica was looking to teach me a lesson,
Barry was ready to learn.
- JTP!
- JTP!
I need you to teach me everything about chemistry so I can get an "A."
Are you sure you want to join us, bro?
Yeah, you tend to just sort of peter out, insult us, and then leave us high and dry.
Not this time, my tiny friend I can fit in my pocket!
I have enough anger in me to last for at least three days.
Let's do this!
- What are you doing?
- Taking photographs with my mind.
You mean memorizing?
Done!
Quiz me.
- Fire away.
- Dude.
It takes more than just glancing at our note cards to know what elements are in Group Four of the Periodic Table.
Titanium, Zirconium, Hafnium, and Rutherfordium.
Whoa.
When you've got hate in your heart,
- you're, like, crazy-smart.
- Also, it totally proves you were never living up to your potential.
Indeed, Geoffrey.
And I will use that potential to stop my mom's evil plan.
And he did.
Barry was so psyched to teach my mom a lesson, he couldn't stop teaching himself.
Well, look at you guys studying.
Just tutoring my boys.
They're having a hard time keeping up.
Keeping up... with you?
Turns out science just kind of clicks when I try.
Barry's even read four chapters ahead for fun.
That's right.
He knows stuff we can't even begin to comprehend.
Until we read that far into the book.
Thanks to you telling me about Mom's awful plan to keep me here to love me forever.
You're really showing her.
Uh, just maybe you keep your rage-learning between us.
But what's the point of knowledge if you don't use it to destroy your mother?
You know what would really stick it to her?
If you tell her after you got into college.
Yeah.
Imagine how miserable she'll be when I go off to Harvard.
You'll destroy her for sure.
But until then, let's just keep it our secret.
Our wonderful secret.
As my dad was trying to keep Barry quiet,
I was just trying to keep my shirt on.
Shirt.
Skin.
Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin, Shirt.
- Yes!
I'm golden.
- Shirt.
Skin.
Skin.
Whoa.
Hey, hang on!
This better be important, Goldfarb!
- It is.
You double-skin.
- Oh, how about that?
I did double-Skin.
But you can't double-Skin.
It's Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin.
I can Skin-Skin anytime I like.
If you Skin-Skin, there's no rules!
It's chaos!
Maybe now you'll know what it feels like to be a young girl coming of age!
Wait, is this about Emmy?
The best teachers never reveal if it's about Emmy.
So it is about Emmy!
You should have just eaten the note.
Everybody eats the note!
Why do people think eating paper is a viable option?
!
Just for the back-talk, you're a skin
- for the rest of the week!
- No!
Now you're a Skin for the rest of the year!
You keep it up, you'll be a Skin for life!
You can't do that.
Trust me, On your wedding day, you will walk down the aisle shirtless.
No respectable venue would allow that!
It'll be a beach wedding!
That sounds wonderful... and like my worst nightmare.
That was when I realized the person I'd enlisted to help me only made it worse.
You did this!
You said you wanted my help, so I'm helping you.
I meant talk to her and make everything better for me.
Instead, you got Mellor all riled up!
You know he riles easily!
I wasn't just gonna bail you out.
- You'd never learn if I did that.
- Learn what?
Do you know how hard it was for me to be Frizzica?
I used to eat lunch in the bathroom stalls.
I'd take the back hallways to avoid boys.
I even spent Saturday nights at home watching the news with Dad.
He yells so much at the news.
It's like he thinks they can hear him!
But you want to know the worst part?
Is I had no one to talk to about any of it.
But Emmy does.
She has you.
But you're only thinking about yourself instead of being there for her.
All right.
Enough lesson-learning.
Shirt off.
Get in the game.
You'll have to catch me first!
I'm athletic when determined.
I'm a Skin.
Boom!
Read it and weep.
Read it to me.
It hurts when I look down.
It's Barry's chemistry test, and guess what?
He aced it!
Or should I say, I aced him!
Guess you did, huh?
No, you said I couldn't "Captain" him,
- but you were wrong, sucka!
- You showed me.
Attention, people in the room.
I have a huge announcement about my future that I need to rub in my mother's face.
No, no, no.
We said we were gonna be rubbing
- at a much later date.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't wait for Harvard to beg me to join their ranks.
This is too good.
It must be rubbed.
Wait, did I hear "Harvard"?
I think I heard "Harvard."
Oh, you heard it.
Thanks to my newfound love of sciences,
I've officially decided what to do with my life.
I shall be a doctor.
- I give you the JTP.
- JTP!
Not the Jenkintown Posse.
I'm talkin' about the Jenkintown Practice, an all-in-one medical facility where I'll be C.E.O. and lead surgeon.
I'm the in-house ophthalmologist.
I'm the foot doc, y'all!
And I'ma play drums in the waiting room.
I cannot believe what I'm hearing!
Tell me more!
No.
Let's not.
Sorry, Mom.
You lose.
- We've heard enough.
- I will succeed in life
- just to spite you.
- No!
What'chu have to say about that?
This is the happiest fucking day of my fucking life!
What?
!
Why is this good news?
'Cause I inspired you to learn!
Now, get up on that table and "O Captain!
My Captain!" me.
But I thought you secretly wanted me to fail.
Of course not.
Uh, who would give you such a nasty idea?
Maybe we should go.
What the hell's happening here?
Ooh, I'd like to stay and quietly watch.
I may have slightly motivated the kid using you as a springboard for his hate.
- Yeah, you get it.
- Wait.
My mom genuinely wants me to thrive?
- This is horrible!
- No, it's great!
You love science now.
We all win.
It's all built on lies!
I fully reject science and all learning!
I'm sorry, JTP.
We're no longer the JTP.
We're just the JTP.
JTP.
Bevy, I only wanted to help the kid succeed.
Well, your way worked.
Congrats.
Wait...
Where you going?
To quit.
I'm no teacher.
And the worst part is, the only thing I inspired in my son is resentment.
I had messed up with Emmy, and it would take a miracle to fix our friendship...
- or a couple of jerks.
- Dude.
Fresh hottie, 9:00.
Nice rack.
Sorry.
Allergies.
In that moment, I finally saw how hard it was for Emmy, and I knew just what I had to do, even if it killed me.
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Adam F. Goldberg.
Not be confused with the other Adam Goldberg.
- The artsy dude?
- Actually, we both have an appreciation for the arts.
He's more of a multi-hyphenate.
I've been focusing on the written word.
What the hell is your problem, dorknard?
I just heard you talking about my friend here.
Dude!
Go away, it's fine.
No, it's not!
I mean, how would you feel if every time you walked through school, the girls talked about your body?
I'd nod and say, "This saddle seats one.
Unless you're a twin, then it seats two."
Point is, maybe we should just be more sensitive.
It's hard enough to be a freshman hoping you can fit in.
I'm hoping you can fit in that trash can.
Exactly.
W...
Wait, what?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Not the trash!
That's where Nurse Steve dumps all the old Band-Aids.
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow!
- Hands off the dork.
- Or what?
I sit behind you in Spanish.
Next siesta you take in class, snip-snip, you lose the ponytail.
But that's where my soul resides.
Come on, man.
She's turning the tables on us, and I don't like it.
Dude!
That was badass.
Well, you're a tough girl.
It may take you a few years, but you'll get there.
Trust me.
Are you crazy?
You almost got trashed!
I just figured I should be there for you, no matter how hard it gets.
Thanks a lot.
Now I'm crying at school 'cause you're such a dumb, great friend.
The dumbest.
Yep, growing up is an awkward adventure, but with a little understanding, we can help each other get through the rough spots.
Hey.
Please don't make a big deal out of this.
Wow.
I get a hug even though I made you a Skin for life?
You also just saved it.
I'm your big sis.
That's what I'm here for.
I'm gonna hug you again.
- Do it and you die.
- No, I...
Sometimes, we're so consumed with our own problems, we can't see what other people are going through until we open our eyes and our hearts.
Dude!
Knock first!
What'd you put under the mattress?
Magazine.
Dirty kind with lady parts.
Physics?
Fine.
Look, I love science.
I'm good at it, and I feel ashamed.
Well, don't.
- I'm proud of you.
- You are?
Look, it was wrong to use your mother against you, but now we know how much you can do if you actually try.
Yeah.
Who knew?
I'll tell you who knew...
Beverly Goldberg.
She believed in you the whole time.
I guess she is a good teacher.
And she's also a damn-good mother.
And maybe it wouldn't hurt if you let her know.
All right!
Quiet down!
I'm your substitute sub, which means study hall for a month!
Sorry to interrupt.
I just came to get my mug.
Wait!
Mom!
O Captain!
My Captain!
- Sit down, Mr. Goldberg!
- On behalf of me and the rest of the Jenkintown Practice, thank you for believing in us.
And in me.
I said sit down, Mr. Goldberg!
- O Captain!
My Captain!
- O Captain!
My Captain!
O Captain!
My Captain!
What'd I say about standing on the desks?
Everybody down!
Dude, they're sticking it to Mellor by standing on school property!
I'm king of whatever class this is!
This school sucks!
Screw you, Dad!
Rush rules!
I will never die!
Turns out, Beverly Goldberg was way more than just a substitute teacher.
She was permanent inspiration.
My baby's gonna be a doctor.
Eh, I'll believe that when I see it.
_
_
Dad, say something.
How do you feel?
I am so proud and happy.
Now that he's gonna be going to medical school,
I cried like a baby.
Because that means for another four years, he'll still be out of the house and we can keep the room neat.
And that is how you perform CPR on a man.
Whoa, Mr. Goldberg, what is that you have there?
Is that another note?
What?
You just...
You know the rule.
If you get caught with a note, you have to stand up and read it out loud so that everybody can hear it.
"Hey, Adam.
Who's your favorite teacher?
I know mine's old Glascott.
He's hip like us.
Dude just gets it.
Did you know he's in a funk fusion band called Funk and Games?
I heard he's playing at the farmer's market this weekend."
I can't read any more.
I'm just gonna eat it.
You can't eat paper!
It'll plug you up!
Ah, the teachers of our youth.
They pushed us, inspired our minds, and made us who we are today.
And when those great teachers got sick, my mom stepped in to be a sub.
Bonjour, my little French fries.
By the time I'm done with you, you're going to be eating snails, not taking baths, and enjoying the silent art of mime.
(Laughs) Like most substitute teachers, she didn't know very much.
They're a weird people, hmm?
Then one day, everything changed.
My Mom saw the movie "Dead Poets Society."
O Captain!
My Captain!
O Captain!
My Captain!
When Robin Williams inspired those stuffy rich kids to stand on their desks, my mom saw her true calling.
Who knew Mork from Ork had such a serious side?
This movie proves that a sub is the most important person in a child's life.
Come Monday, that's just what I'm gonna do... inspire my kids.
You mean your students or your actual kids?
Both.
It's a win-win.
I'm sure they'll see it that way.
- Hey, shut up!
- You shut up!
Good morning, class.
Uh, before we get started, does anyone need to make?
Hmm?
Anyone?
There's gonna be a lot of learning today, so if you got to make, do it now.
Anyone got to make poo-poos?
Stop!
- No one has to make!
- Moving on.
All right, according to this memo from Principal Ball,
Mr. Gluckman has been checked into a rehab facility to address his relationship with cocaine.
"Please tell the students he has the flu."
Okay.
Mr. Gluckman has the flu.
(Chuckles)
I'll be your sub for the next 30 days.
- Sweet!
- A sub!
We get to waste a whole month of critical learning that'll put us behind for years to come!
No, JTP!
History has proven my mom turns awesome things to garbage!
Aw, who's that handsome fella?
- Is he single?
- This is a nightmare.
Question, Who here is familiar with the film "Dead Poets Society?"
Chill, dude.
Your mom's gonna show us a movie.
It's a classic sub move.
Oh, we're not watching it.
We're living it!
- Oh, no.
- Barry's right.
In fact, I need a volunteer chosen completely at random to come stand on my desk and view the world
- from a new perspective.
- Oh, No!
She wants us to learn by standing on furniture?
Standing on a desk was how Robin Williams inspired his students.
Unfortunately, not everyone liked to see things from a different angle.
Whoa, whoa!
There's no climbing in school!
Unless it's on a rope hung dangerously from the rafters of the gymnasium.
Dude, the hot sub told us to do it.
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?
(Laughing) Ho!
Look, everyone!
It's the stuffy administration coming to clip my wings!
No!
For the past 30 years,
Mr. Gluckman has sloshed corrosive chemicals all over that old desk.
It's falling apart.
I fear nothing.
Like any great teacher, I encourage my students to seize the day!
(Creaking)
Aah!
♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪
♪ But nonetheless, I feel the need to say ♪
♪ I don't know the future ♪
♪ But the past keeps getting clearer every day ♪
It was January 4, 1980-something, the day a single text message rocked my world.
Yo.
Get this note to Goldnerd for me.
Yep, back in the '80s, this was our version of sending a text.
You'd have to pass a note the old-fashioned way, by hand.
Only problem was, your messages weren't password-protected.
Mr. Goldberg, since that little paper is more important than life-saving CPR, maybe you'd like to stand and share it with the rest of us.
"Ballsssss."
To be clear...
I did not write this.
"Dude, when did Emmy Mirsky get so dang foxy?
I mean, holy boobs, Batman!
(Scattered laughter)
Look at those sweatshirt puppies."
Again, I did not write this.
Oh, that sucked.
My intention was to teach you a lesson about note-passing, but instead, I just made us all feel wildly uncomfortable.
(Chuckles) Let's just move on to Chapter 6, okay?
Female reproductive...
Nope.
Class dismissed.
Next time you get caught with a note, just do what a normal person does
- and eat it.
- Dude, you can't eat paper.
My mom says it plugs up your bottom.
Small price to pay to avoid total humiliation.
I know, right?
I had to stand up in front of everyone and talk about my best friend's, you know, stuff.
Wait.
You thought that note was embarrassing for you?
Well, who else would it embarrass?
- Me!
- Why?
The note said you were hot.
You should be happy about it.
Are you serious right now?
Dork!
Boy, you really know your way around relationships with human beings.
I agree I'm flawed, but I honestly have no idea what I said wrong here.
Okay, I'm gonna shed some light on what it's like to be a freshman girl, and it ain't gonna be pretty.
The seniors called me "Frizzica Spazzberg."
Every 9th-grade girl, no matter how she looks, feels uncomfortable in her own skin.
There's a hunk of lettuce in your braces.
How did you not feel it?
I was going through a salad phase!
My point is, Emmy just needs a friend who understands how she feels.
Seriously, though, there's like a whole head of romaine in there.
I am gonna give you one second to walk away.
1!
As I was learning how to be a better friend, my mom was teaching Barry how to be a better student.
I don't understand!
This is my house, not my school.
Now that I have the teaching tools I learned in a movie,
I will not rest until you get an "A" in this class.
Okay, now, the atomic symbol "C"
stands for what?
- Chemistry!
- Carbon.
It stands for Carbon.
But it also stands for chemistry, so half a point?
Okay.
Name three types of inert gases.
Easy.
There's regular, unleaded, and... farts?
- Farts?
- Farts.
The answer is not farts!
How is fart not a gas?
!
Science makes no sense, and I don't need it!
Especially 'cause I'm gonna marry Kathy Ireland.
- Who?
- Supermodel Kathy Ireland.
I'm gonna be her lazy mooch of a husband who lives in her mansion in Ireland!
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go brush up on my Irish culture and (bad Irish accent) find me gold at the end of the rainbow, mon.
Well, that accent was definitely Jamaican.
Boopie, don't give up!
Mama believes in you!
Question...
Why?
You're a substitute teacher.
Just give the boy a damn "A" already.
- You want me to cheat?
- Of course I do.
We got to get that moron into some sort of college.
Can you believe this, Dad?
- He thinks Barry can't do it.
- His answer was "farts."
Okay, you really want him to buckle down?
Let me go upstairs and get his ass in gear.
By yelling at him and calling him a moron?
No way.
That doesn't work.
Barry needs inspiration.
All I need to do is unlock his potential, and then the sky's the limit.
His many limits are the limit.
His answer was "farts."
That day, I was also on a mission to prove to Emmy I felt her pain.
All right, hormonal disasters!
It's time to pick teams!
Shirts, Skins, Shirts, Skins,
Okay, so why exactly did we cut math to sit in on some random gym class?
What you're witnessing is a barbaric practice known as "Shirts vs. Skins."
Nothing is worse than having to awkwardly disrobe
- in front of your bros.
- You got to be kidding me.
I know!
I mean, why not shorts vs. pants?
or red shirts vs. blue shirts?
Sure, it would take some planning the night before, but I could get a phone tree going.
I mean, we are not the same.
Do you wear thick, baggy-ass clothes when it's 90 degrees out to hide your body?
I thought you wear that 'cause you love Epcot.
I've never even been there!
Why would I love it?
'Cause it's like taking a trip around the world without leaving the safe confines of Orlando?
Being a Skin in gym is nothing compared to being stared at all day.
Well, if you think about it, my thing's actually way worse 'cause at least you get to cover up with bulky fabrics.
I get no fabrics!
None!
You're a douche lord!
(Music Playing)
Hey, Bar, how's studying with Mom going?
Rad as all get-out.
Only took two minutes to finish all of my homework.
She's really teaching you science stuff?
Let's just say Mom is gonna be very pleased with my answers.
(Chuckles) Pops, give us a taste.
Question 1.
"What is the chemical symbol for sodium?"
And my answer?
"My mommy is the best mommy ever of all mommies on Planet Mommy."
Nailed it!
What the hell are you doing, you moron?
Just giving the lady the answers she always wanted to hear.
Pops, what's the atomic weight of chloride?
"Wittle Barry-wary like Mummy's snuggy-wuggies."
Okay, this is just nonsense.
And with that, my dad knew it was time to inspire Barry in his own way.
Look, I hate to tell you this, but your mom is looking for any excuse to fail you.
What?
Why?
Mom telling you to study is just a trick, because she knows you never do what she says.
I do don't do that!
She really wants you to fail so you don't graduate.
And no college means you live here forever.
And that means she picks out your clothes for the rest of your life.
But I want Kathy Ireland to pick out my clothes for the rest of my life.
Well, I hope she enjoys sharing a family bathroom.
No!
She likes sushi and smoothies and Malibu!
I don't know what to tell you.
Mom will not control me.
I will learn all chemistry...
No, all science!
- Mom says you won't.
- Oh, I will.
Time for me to tear off this plastic shrink-wrap and get to learning.
But the year is half-over.
And that, my friend, is how you truly inspire a kid.
All you did was use his mother as a weapon to rile him up.
I do it all the time.
It's how I got Erica to learn piano,
Adam to ice skate.
I just tell them that their mom is holding them back.
You do know that if Bev finds out about this, she'll never forgive you.
No doubt.
Aw, screw it.
You did what you had to do.
It had been days since Emmy talked to me, so I decided to recruit someone who spoke her language.
Okay, before you throw a hard object at me
- and say "Get out"...
- Get out!
I have a big favor to ask and will pay a huge sum of money to do it.
I'm listening.
I need you to give this note to Emmy and make her read it.
She's still not talking to you, huh?
Honestly, she's being crazy and irrational, but as you can see in this note,
I'm the bigger man and still willing to apologize.
"Dear Emmy, you're being crazy and irrational.
Let me explain the many reasons why your super-silly female body issues are all in your head." No.
Fine!
Then...
Then you fix it.
Exactly how much money are we talking here?
$1,000.
Which is what this Megatron will be worth on the black market in 30 years.
- I'll do it for 20 bucks.
- 5 bucks and a Skeletor?
I'll do it if you just go away now.
And so my sister would help me, but not by going to Emmy.
Hey, Coach.
Got a minute?
Kind of busy, female Goldberg.
I'm inventing a new hybrid sport.
Either, uh, baseball fencing or water-polo squash.
You can't play squash under water.
- People need to breathe.
- Need to breathe.
(Sighs) That makes sense.
"Need... to... breathe".
Uh-huh.
So, my brother's been a bad friend to Emmy Mirsky.
Ah, stabbed in the back by her best amigo.
That is a crime worse than all the murders in the world.
I don't think that's right, but sure.
So, could you help her by blatantly abusing your authority?
You want old Coach to exact sweet revenge, huh?
No problem.
- You're an amazing teacher.
- I'm sure of it.
While Erica was looking to teach me a lesson,
Barry was ready to learn.
- JTP!
- JTP!
I need you to teach me everything about chemistry so I can get an "A."
Are you sure you want to join us, bro?
Yeah, you tend to just sort of peter out, insult us, and then leave us high and dry.
Not this time, my tiny friend I can fit in my pocket!
I have enough anger in me to last for at least three days.
Let's do this!
- What are you doing?
- Taking photographs with my mind.
You mean memorizing?
Done!
Quiz me.
- Fire away.
- Dude. (Chuckles)
It takes more than just glancing at our note cards to know what elements are in Group Four of the Periodic Table.
Titanium, Zirconium, Hafnium, and Rutherfordium.
Whoa.
When you've got hate in your heart,
- you're, like, crazy-smart.
- Also, it totally proves you were never living up to your potential.
Indeed, Geoffrey.
And I will use that potential to stop my mom's evil plan.
And he did.
Barry was so psyched to teach my mom a lesson, he couldn't stop teaching himself.
Well, look at you guys studying.
Just tutoring my boys.
They're having a hard time keeping up.
Keeping up... with you?
Turns out science just kind of clicks when I try.
Barry's even read four chapters ahead for fun.
That's right.
He knows stuff we can't even begin to comprehend.
Until we read that far into the book.
Thanks to you telling me about Mom's awful plan to keep me here to love me forever.
You're really showing her.
Uh, just maybe you keep your rage-learning between us.
But what's the point of knowledge if you don't use it to destroy your mother?
You know what would really stick it to her?
If you tell her after you got into college.
(Laughs) Yeah.
Imagine how miserable she'll be when I go off to Harvard.
You'll destroy her for sure.
But until then, let's just keep it our secret.
Our wonderful secret.
As my dad was trying to keep Barry quiet,
I was just trying to keep my shirt on.
Shirt.
Skin.
Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin, Shirt.
- Yes!
I'm golden.
- Shirt.
Skin.
Skin.
Whoa.
Hey, hang on!
This better be important, Goldfarb!
- It is.
You double-skin.
- Oh, how about that?
I did double-Skin.
But you can't double-Skin.
It's Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin.
I can Skin-Skin anytime I like.
If you Skin-Skin, there's no rules!
It's chaos!
Maybe now you'll know what it feels like to be a young girl coming of age!
Wait, is this about Emmy?
The best teachers never reveal if it's about Emmy.
So it is about Emmy!
You should have just eaten the note.
Everybody eats the note!
Why do people think eating paper is a viable option?
!
Just for the back-talk, you're a skin
- for the rest of the week!
- No!
Now you're a Skin for the rest of the year!
You keep it up, you'll be a Skin for life!
You can't do that.
Trust me, On your wedding day, you will walk down the aisle shirtless.
No respectable venue would allow that!
It'll be a beach wedding!
(Groans) That sounds wonderful... and like my worst nightmare.
That was when I realized the person I'd enlisted to help me only made it worse.
You did this!
You said you wanted my help, so I'm helping you.
I meant talk to her and make everything better for me.
Instead, you got Mellor all riled up!
You know he riles easily!
I wasn't just gonna bail you out.
- You'd never learn if I did that.
- Learn what?
Do you know how hard it was for me to be Frizzica?
I used to eat lunch in the bathroom stalls.
I'd take the back hallways to avoid boys.
I even spent Saturday nights at home watching the news with Dad.
He yells so much at the news.
It's like he thinks they can hear him!
But you want to know the worst part?
Is I had no one to talk to about any of it.
But Emmy does.
She has you.
But you're only thinking about yourself instead of being there for her.
(Whistle blows)
All right.
Enough lesson-learning.
Shirt off.
Get in the game.
You'll have to catch me first!
I'm athletic when determined.
(Thud)
(Groans) I'm a Skin.
(Backgroud Music playing)
Boom!
Read it and weep.
Read it to me.
It hurts when I look down.
It's Barry's chemistry test, and guess what?
He aced it!
Or should I say, I aced him!
Guess you did, huh?
No, you said I couldn't "Captain" him,
- but you were wrong, sucka!
- You showed me.
Attention, people in the room.
I have a huge announcement about my future that I need to rub in my mother's face.
No, no, no.
We said we were gonna be rubbing
- at a much later date.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't wait for Harvard to beg me to join their ranks.
This is too good.
It must be rubbed.
Wait, did I hear "Harvard"?
I think I heard "Harvard."
Oh, you heard it.
Thanks to my newfound love of sciences,
I've officially decided what to do with my life.
I shall be a doctor.
(Gasps)
- I give you the JTP.
- JTP!
Not the Jenkintown Posse.
I'm talkin' about the Jenkintown Practice, an all-in-one medical facility where I'll be C.E.O. and lead surgeon.
I'm the in-house ophthalmologist.
I'm the foot doc, y'all!
And I'ma play drums in the waiting room.
I cannot believe what I'm hearing!
Tell me more!
No.
Let's not.
Sorry, Mom.
You lose.
- We've heard enough.
- I will succeed in life
- just to spite you.
- No!
What'chu have to say about that?
This is the happiest fucking day of my fucking life!
What?
!
Why is this good news?
'Cause I inspired you to learn!
Now, get up on that table and "O Captain!
My Captain!" me.
But I thought you secretly wanted me to fail.
Of course not.
Uh, who would give you such a nasty idea?
(Dog yelps)
Maybe we should go.
What the hell's happening here?
Ooh, I'd like to stay and quietly watch.
I may have slightly motivated the kid using you as a springboard for his hate.
- Yeah, you get it.
- Wait.
My mom genuinely wants me to thrive?
- This is horrible!
- No, it's great!
You love science now.
We all win.
It's all built on lies!
I fully reject science and all learning!
(Sighs) I'm sorry, JTP.
We're no longer the JTP.
We're just the JTP.
(Sadly) JTP.
Bevy, I only wanted to help the kid succeed.
Well, your way worked.
Congrats.
Wait...
Where you going?
To quit.
I'm no teacher.
And the worst part is, the only thing I inspired in my son is resentment.
(Sighs)
I had messed up with Emmy, and it would take a miracle to fix our friendship...
- or a couple of jerks.
- Dude.
Fresh hottie, 9:00.
(Coughing) Nice rack.
Sorry.
Allergies. (Chuckles)
In that moment, I finally saw how hard it was for Emmy, and I knew just what I had to do, even if it killed me.
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Adam F. Goldberg.
Not be confused with the other Adam Goldberg.
- The artsy dude?
- Actually, we both have an appreciation for the arts.
He's more of a multi-hyphenate.
I've been focusing on the written word.
What the hell is your problem, dorknard?
I just heard you talking about my friend here.
Dude!
Go away, it's fine.
No, it's not!
I mean, how would you feel if every time you walked through school, the girls talked about your body?
I'd nod and say, "This saddle seats one.
Unless you're a twin, then it seats two."
Point is, maybe we should just be more sensitive.
It's hard enough to be a freshman hoping you can fit in.
I'm hoping you can fit in that trash can.
Exactly.
W...
Wait, what?
Oh!
Oh, God!
(Panting) Not the trash!
That's where Nurse Steve dumps all the old Band-Aids.
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow!
- Hands off the dork.
- Or what?
I sit behind you in Spanish.
Next siesta you take in class, snip-snip, you lose the ponytail.
But that's where my soul resides.
Come on, man.
She's turning the tables on us, and I don't like it.
Dude!
That was badass.
Well, you're a tough girl.
It may take you a few years, but you'll get there.
Trust me.
Are you crazy?
You almost got trashed!
I just figured I should be there for you, no matter how hard it gets.
(Chuckles)
Thanks a lot. (Sniffles)
Now I'm crying at school 'cause you're such a dumb, great friend.
The dumbest. (Both chuckle)
Yep, growing up is an awkward adventure, but with a little understanding, we can help each other get through the rough spots.
Hey.
Please don't make a big deal out of this.
Wow.
I get a hug even though I made you a Skin for life?
You also just saved it.
I'm your big sis.
That's what I'm here for.
I'm gonna hug you again.
- Do it and you die.
- No, I...
Sometimes, we're so consumed with our own problems, we can't see what other people are going through until we open our eyes and our hearts.
Dude!
Knock first!
What'd you put under the mattress?
Magazine.
Dirty kind with lady parts.
- Physics?
- (Sighs)
Fine.
Look, I love science.
I'm good at it, and I feel ashamed.
Well, don't.
- I'm proud of you.
- You are?
Look, it was wrong to use your mother against you, but now we know how much you can do if you actually try.
Yeah.
Who knew?
I'll tell you who knew...
Beverly Goldberg.
She believed in you the whole time.
I guess she is a good teacher.
And she's also a damn-good mother.
And maybe it wouldn't hurt if you let her know.
- (Indistinct conversations) - (Whistle blows)
All right!
Quiet down!
I'm your substitute sub, which means study hall for a month!
Sorry to interrupt.
I just came to get my mug.
Wait!
Mom!
(Music Playing)
O Captain!
My Captain!
- Sit down, Mr. Goldberg!
- On behalf of me and the rest of the Jenkintown Practice, thank you for believing in us.
And in me.
I said sit down, Mr. Goldberg!
- O Captain!
My Captain!
- O Captain!
My Captain!
O Captain!
My Captain!
What'd I say about standing on the desks?
Everybody down!
Dude, they're sticking it to Mellor by standing on school property!
I'm king of whatever class this is!
This school sucks!
Screw you, Dad!
Rush rules!
I will never die!
Turns out, Beverly Goldberg was way more than just a substitute teacher.
She was permanent inspiration.
My baby's gonna be a doctor.
Eh, I'll believe that when I see it.

Dad, say something.
How do you feel?
I am so proud and happy.
Now that he's gonna be going to medical school,
I cried like a baby.
Because that means for another four years, he'll still be out of the house and we can keep the room neat.
And that is how you perform CPR on a man.
Whoa, Mr. Goldberg, what is that you have there?
Is that another note?
What?
You just...
You know the rule.
If you get caught with a note, you have to stand up and read it out loud so that everybody can hear it.
"Hey, Adam.
Who's your favorite teacher?
I know mine's old Glascott.
He's hip like us.
Dude just gets it.
Did you know he's in a funk fusion band called Funk and Games?
I heard he's playing at the farmer's market this weekend."
I can't read any more.
I'm just gonna eat it.

It was boarding school.
You were there...

I hope you were better at that than you are at this.

Better me than a mediator.
Alex:
I can't believe we're going back into the real world.
I just wish we didn't have to.
But after what happened in New York, we can't expect the Collaborators will hit the cache anytime soon, so we have to go back to our cover lives.
Adios, muchachas.
Ooh.
Shelby, do you still have those ski gloves?
- Have fun freezing your butt off.
- Thank you.
Ski gloves?
Since when do you ski?
I don't know.
Since high school.
This is a prank.
Is this a prank?
'Cause he doesn't ski.
You don't ski.
Well, I guess you never really know someone, do you?
And who's gonna wear these dainty little things?
I'm pretty sure it's not you.
An asset I'm developing...
a reporter from the Journal.
The one who exposed Sean Gregory?
Well, someone's got to find out how that happened.
See you next time the world explodes.
Since when does Ryan ski?
Um, your ex-fiancé is most likely dating someone for the first time since you...
a likely asset... and that is your headline?
I just thought I knew everything about him.
Oh, you can never know everything about anybody.
We just learn what we learn as we learn it.
There's always more.
Yeah, I could definitely use a break from this fishbowl.

What are you doing here?
Well, Nimah asked me to meet her, but she's not here yet.
Well, have a seat.
Right.
Thanks.
So, how was your visit?
Well, we talked... technically.
I-I wouldn't say we used full sentences.
Lydia didn't have a lot to say, huh?
No.
I'm the one who didn't have anything to say.
I can't ask her what I really need to know.
Was it my fault?
Did I make her into this person?
Did she just make a mistake?
Is this who she really is?
[Groans]
Anyway, you must be excited.
You all get to go back to your lives.
You've got your fancy New York apartment.
[Laughs]
Shelby has her D.C. townhouse.
Harry has... whatever it is he ran away to.
But me?
This is my life.
No friends, fractured family.
Hey, look, I could, um...
I could stay for a while.
Thanks, but I'll see you when you get back.
Okay, sure.
Wow.
Rebuffed again.
I told you you were predictable.
Alex... go home.
At least you still can.

Is he gone?
Owen?
Yeah.

Hello?
I went to see Raina.
She isn't here.
Her apartment is full of anti-American propaganda, blueprints for a shopping center, bomb components.
It looks exactly like yours did last year.
I-I don't know where she is.
I do, and she's safe.
Let me call you right back, okay?
Your sister's really worried about you...
Raina.
[Spoon's "Shotgun" plays]
I've never done something like this before.
What, ski?
Oh, it's easy.
It's expensive, but it's easy.
No.
Going away with a man I've only had a half a date with.
Locked away for the whole weekend with no distractions, it means that we'll get to know the real us faster.
Ah.
And we'll spend a whole ton of money getting cold, wet, and bruised up in the process.

Are you in trouble?
What happened to your hijab?
I was attacked.
A man and a woman... they put things in my apartment, Alex.
I think they're trying to frame me.
Male reporter:
We interrupt with breaking news.
Female Reporter:
Details are just emerging from what appears to be a deadly terror attack on American soil in Dayton, Ohio, this morning, where a bomber struck the Gallow Green Shopping Center.
- Wait... wait here.
- At least 15 are dead and dozens wounded.
The Islamic Front has claimed credit for the Dayton attack.
Authorities believe they are close to identifying the actual bomber, who is described as a female wearing a hijab.
They are moving to identify her based on CCTV footage from the scene.
Looks like it's time to get you out of here.
- This attack comes after a long period
- Come on.
of a national soul-searching in the wake of the G20 crisis.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- What is the nature of terror in America?
What and who should we fear and why?
Female reporter:
This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack
- from a more confident GOP.
- I don't get it.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?
How does this fit in to their endgame?
Could just be a terrorist attack.
- And we don't know it was them.
- Yes, we do.
...are necessary in order to protect this country...
Cache ping from last week.
A confidential white paper from the NSC, breaking down potential terror attacks against soft targets...
I-I looked into it, but nothing came of it.
So, I figured it was part of a plan they abandoned.
I'm sorry to see that wasn't true.
Why bomb a mall?
To create panic?
To generate fear?
No. [Chuckles softly]
To play politics.
Today at 8:00 p.m., the House of Representatives has a vote scheduled on S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
You mean the Muslim registry?
Technically, it's a system to allow Homeland to register and track non-citizen visa holders from countries of concern.
Those countries just happen to be exclusively Arab or Muslim.
But NEERS already failed twice.
Why now?
Terror, fear, spilt blood in the heartland, and a Muslim immigrant mastermind framed for the crime.
She has a name...
Raina Amin.
Raina came to us on the run from a team that staged her apartment to look like she could have planned an attack like this.
This isn't a coincidence.
We think she's being framed.
I'll put money the FBI releases her name as a suspect within the hour.
This attack is about one thing... pushing Congress to pass the registry.
This team was created to put an end to the rogue group of agents within the CIA working on behalf of eight power players in America.
Today, that mission takes on this form... make sure S-322 goes down in flames.
That registry cannot happen.
We cannot allow the Collaborators to take the next step in their long-term plan.
You're talking about FBI agents and CIA operatives actively interfering with the democratic process.
Look, I know that we cross a lot of lines, but that's a big one.
The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.
The Collaborators took the gloves off first.
We're just following suit.
How does that fit in to their long-term plan?
And what is that plan?
Shouldn't that be what we're trying to figure out?
Well, we will when we have the luxury of time, but for now, we got to stop this bill.
It's been out of the Senate for months.
The House is the holdup.
We have a few things we need to figure out.
Where are the votes?
Who are the swings?
And how do we push this thing to defeat?
We also need to figure out who's framing Raina.
If they work for the Collaborators and we expose their hand in this, maybe we could reverse this wave of fear fueling the vote.
Good.
Take point on that.
The rest of you, huddle up.
This is now our war room.
Golden Boy's back in his element.
After watching you kick down doors and shoot guns, now you get to see what I can do.
This is the playing field.
435 votes decide the game.
So, how many Republicans do we need to flip to vote "no"?
Depends on how many Democrats we can flip to vote "no," too.
The Democrats are voting for the Muslim registry?
Shelby:
My state representative's a Democrat.
He voted for it.
Law and order's one of those issues that crosses party lines.
9/11, Iraq.
It's hard to vote against fear when fear's so fresh.
So, how do we I.D. our targets?
Good question.
Tough one, too.
This is a radioactive issue.
People will hide their votes until the last minute.
So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.
And how do we do that?
The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.
No, but I do.
No, no.
Go back.
Her.
Alex:
Ginny Kearns, ex-military.
And she was working the G20 as a security consultant.
She has to be connected to the AIC.
Gun for hire, maybe?
And if she had a partner, it has to be someone that she trusted.
Pull up K.A.s. Maybe I could recognize him, too.
Known associates.
Good idea.
I don't understand something, Raina.
The government covered up everything that happened at the G20.
They didn't release your name.
Why are the AIC after you?
Because I was investigating them, Alex.
It should have never been covered up.
Someone had to try to expose them.
- Raina...
- I called the other survivors.
I tried to put together the real story of what happened.
León Velez... you know him, right?
He was doing the same.
We were supposed to meet, but he never showed up.
[Door opens]
Um, I think I should leave.
It's best if you stay.
[Sighs]
I want to talk to you alone.
Alex:
I'll be upstairs, and you'll be fine.
- I'm glad you're safe.
- Good.
Now that you know I'm safe, you can leave.
We haven't spoken for weeks, and that's all you have to say to me?
There's nothing left to say.
Look... all I wanted was to hear your voice.
If something had happened to you...
Something did happen to me, and I survived it without you.
I don't need you, Nimah.
And you need Alex?
I trust Alex.
And you can't trust me?
The person who used me at the G20, manipulated me, and lied to me?
I'm still your sister.
And you know very well who I am beneath my mistakes.
That's the problem.
[Sighs]
Hey.
You okay?
Just came to change my clothes.
There's not much need for long johns if I'm gonna be hanging out in the bunker all day.
You look disappointed.
Who would've thought you liked to ski so much?
It bothers you.
I just don't believe it.
Why didn't I know about it?
Well, maybe you never asked.
[Cellphone buzzes]
- I'm...
I'm...
- I know.
[Buzzing continues]
Hello?
Man:
Alex Parrish?
This is Tyler Dinucci, Baltimore P.D.
I'm calling about León Velez.
Clay:
All right, we've narrowed down the representatives who can make or break this vote.
The Honorable Kyle Stutz...
Republican, California.
When he supported marriage equality, activists tried to primary him, and they lost.
He will buck party lines again if we can give him a reason to.
Jihane Hassane...
Democrat, Michigan's third, a Sikh who needs to prove she's tough on terrorism.
Jim Kreigsman...
Democrat, Ohio.
He lost a son in Afghanistan.
Gold-plated NatSec credentials.
If we can get him, the rest of the Dems will fall in line.
And finally, Meredith Cardenas, the first and only member of the Republicans' Latina caucus, who understands Latinos could be the next ones in the cross hairs of this registry.
That's a lot of names and not much time.
We knew it was gonna be an uphill battle.
Let's not give up now.
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, you're with me.
How do we know they're the key votes?
I've got a friend in the Speaker's office who can tell us if we're on the right path.
You mean Henry Roarke's office?
That better be one hell of a friend.
His boss is a Collaborator.
The asset I've been working used to report on Capitol Hill lifestyle.
She can fill the gaps on our oppo work and tell us what we're missing.
Fold her in.
We can use all the help we can get.
Any luck I.D.'ing Raina's attacker?
We have a name...
Tony Vincent, a buddy from Ginny Kearns' unit in Afghanistan.
They found work together as hired hit men after their enlistment ended.
Alex and I will find this man, question him, and clear Raina's name.
Do it.
You worried?
Don't be.
I got you.
No, no.
Th-That's not it.
Um...
So, Raina told me she'd been in contact with León Velez, but he'd gone dark.
So, I made a few calls.
His landlord just found him an hour ago, dead in his bathtub.
Suicide.
They got to him, Owen.
The same people who are trying to get to Raina.
I...
I didn't want to alarm anyone, so...
No, no.
You're right not to.
We'll just let them do the work right now while we track down whoever killed León and attacked Raina.
All right?
Hey, you still have that friend in Capitol Hill Police?
I need credentials on Sasha Barinov, fast.
I can make the call.
- Is her record clear?
- Of course.
Good, because if she has any skeletons in her closet, they will find them.
Clay:
All right, everyone, the fate of 3 1/2 million Americans rests on us.
That's how many Muslims there are in this country.
The only people that can stop them from losing their civil liberty are standing in this room right now.
The vote's in six hours.
Let's get this done.
Good luck.
- Man:
That's not what we agreed upon...
- Shelby:
Guess someone's in a hurry.
It's a big day.
Places to be, civil liberties to erode.
So, what's the plan?
The registry is on track for an 8:00 p.m. vote, so we have little time to stop it.
We need to make sure the swing votes we I.D.'d will indeed swing.
Ryan:
Oh, Sasha's here.
Credentials came through.
I'll connect with her and see what she knows that we don't, all right?
I don't understand how we're gonna do this.
Even if we have all of the right names, what can we do to talk anyone into voting "no"?
I've got access to the President to offer.
You've got the purse strings of an important defense contractor.
And I will put a face on this registry and remind them of what really matters.
But first, we start with Felix Cordova.
Why would he help us?
He works for the enemy.
He's my friend.
I know him.
He'll play ball.
[Exhales sharply]
Looking for a better view of the foliage?
What do you think is waiting for us there?
Just a man who needs to answer a few questions.
That's all.
How do we know Vincent's even there?
Well, the land is in his name, power and water are running.
What if he doesn't talk?
This man is the only person who can point his finger at all the Collaborators.
He'll talk.
I'll make sure of it.
This seems easy for you.
I mean, I know you've taught this, but you haven't done anything like this in decades.
Well, that's why it's so easy.
I've spent 20 years with my wings clipped, not being allowed to be the man I knew I really was.
Now I can.
- [Telephone ringing] - [Door opens]
I'm sorry I'm late.
Big day.
You brought friends.
And you are...
Nimah Amin.
Would you like me to spell this for your little registry?
[Chuckles]
You're funny.
It's not funny to us.
And it shouldn't be to you, either.
There's no way the guy I know believes in singling out an entire religion as the bad guy.
I'm not in charge.
Shelby:
You're an immigrant.
How can you come to this country and then work to deprive other immigrants of their rights?
You live in a bubble.
Elites like you don't understand the concerns of everyday Americans.
Says the guy with a family crest.
I am an everyday American.
Hey, we know you're in a bind here, Felix.
Publicly, you have to support your boss, but secretly, maybe you're hoping this whole registry goes down in flames.
We can help make that happen.
All you have to do is give us the names of the swing votes you're targeting to win.
We will do the rest.
No one will ever know.
Stutz?
Cardenas?
Kreigsman?
Mullen?
Hassane?
Who are we missing?
Tell us.
I can't.
I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.
I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.
And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.
Let's move.
Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.
I'll wait for your funeral, you right-wing sellout.
[Door slams]
[Door hinges squeak]
[Door closes]
[Light switch clicks, gun cocks]
Alex:
Hands where I can see them.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
You're about to find out.
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey.
What's the word?
Oh, not even a "hello"?
Clock's ticking.
My team needs to know what's happening with the vote.
Your names check out on my end, though you can take Mullen off the list.
Roarke finally okayed the money for a regional airport with his name on it.
Now even God couldn't change him to a "no."
Well, it's nice to see you in your element.
[Chuckles] Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.
We'll get there.
Grab me when you know more, okay?
[Sighs]
Did you know this was gonna happen?
Am I just an asset you're working?
Not "just," no.
But an asset, first and foremost.
Look, people like us... we help each other out when we need it.
Doesn't mean everything else doesn't matter.
No, I guess it doesn't.
- I got to go, okay?
- Mm-mh.
- When this is over with...
- The lift tickets are on you?
[Chuckles]
That's fair.
- Go.
- Okay.
Mullen's out.
That takes one name off the list, a name that we need.
If our math is right, we'll have to convince all of the remaining targets to vote "no."
What "Black Mirror" episode did we wake up in?
How can any American support the Muslim registry?
Shelby:
Most everyone I grew up with would.
My sorority sisters would.
Hell, once upon a time, I would have, too.
FBI work taught me better, but still, I understand.
You're apologizing for those people?
Those people are a part of this country.
If you ignore their voice, how can you expect them to hear yours?
Look, I'm not saying they're right.
I'm saying they have a right to their opinion.
Ah, the real America... two blond people arguing the merits of my freedom instead of letting me have it.
The fact that this is even happening is an atrocity.
We've learned nothing from history.
[Chuckles]
Turn those votes.
[Spoon's "Do I Have to Talk You Into It" plays]
Ms. Wyatt, I'm not afraid to cross the aisle when it matters, but the nation is already reacting on both sides.
Pro- and anti-Muslim protests are already forming.
I can't afford to alienate my base.
You won't be if you give your district a big enough win on the employment front... say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant and a thousand jobs to go with it.
I have to worry about my job first.
I just can't take the risk.
My apologies.

But when you create a list, you're also creating a recruitment tool.
It's making it easier for a kid to choose a life of suicide vests over anything else.
Believe me when I tell you this is making us more vulnerable, not less.
America is scared, and so am I.
They want action.
My vote is "yes," and I'm not sorry.
Why is it every time a Muslim kills someone in this country, he's a terrorist, but, you know, if a white man does it, he's simply disturbed?
Kreigsman:
Save that claptrap for your buddies in the lamestream media.
My vote's "yes," and it's rock-solid.
Your mother should know better than sending you in here like this.

What's wrong?
FBI counterintelligence has Sasha Barinov flagged as a possible FSB asset.
She's not a Russian spy.
Well, my Capitol Police friend just heard back from the FBI after helping us with Sasha's credentials.
I thought you should know.
Sir, we've received a complaint and have been instructed to escort you out of the building.
Complaint?
From whom?
Felix.
He sent us after the wrong congressmen.
Did you have a nice field trip today?
It's nothing personal, just politics.
But I want to say thanks.
I had a lot of undecideds who hate your mother, and seeing you do her dirty work helped bring them home.
It won't even be a narrow margin now.
Sir, we have to go.
Come on.
Who do you work for?
You're gonna find out yourself the longer you keep me here.
Did you kill León Velez?

That was you in Central Park.
You put Rebecca Sherman up to that?
That's a "yes."
You better stop asking questions and start answering them.
No.
You better get out of here.
I messed up.
They'll be coming for me.
They?

The cops were supposed to find Amin's body in the mall.
She got away.

Female Reporter:
Details are just emerging from what appears to be a deadly terror attack on American soil in Dayton, Ohio, this morning, where a bomber struck the Gallow Green Shopping Center.
- Wait... wait here.
- At least 15 are dead and dozens wounded.
The Islamic Front has claimed credit for the Dayton attack.
Authorities believe they are close to identifying the actual bomber, who is described as a female wearing a hijab.
They are moving to identify her based on CCTV footage from the scene.
Looks like it's time to get you out of here.
- This attack comes after a long period
- Come on.
Of a national soul-searching in the wake of the G20 crisis.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- What is the nature of terror in America?
What and who should we fear and why?
Female reporter:
This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack
- from a more confident GOP.
- I don't get it.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?
How does this fit in to their endgame?
Could just be a terrorist attack.
- And we don't know it was them.
- Yes, we do.
...are necessary in order to protect this country...
Cache ping from last week.
A confidential white paper from the NSC, breaking down potential terror attacks against soft targets...
I-I looked into it, but nothing came of it.
So, I figured it was part of a plan they abandoned.
I'm sorry to see that wasn't true.
Why bomb a mall?
To create panic?
To generate fear?
No. [Chuckles softly]
To play politics.
Today at 8:00 p.m., the House of Representatives has a vote scheduled on S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
You mean the Muslim registry?
Technically, it's a system to allow Homeland to register and track non-citizen visa holders from countries of concern.
Those countries just happen to be exclusively Arab or Muslim.
But NEERS already failed twice.
Why now?
Terror, fear, spilt blood in the heartland, and a Muslim immigrant mastermind framed for the crime.
She has a name...
Raina Amin.
Raina came to us on the run from a team that staged her apartment to look like she could have planned an attack like this.
This isn't a coincidence.
We think she's being framed.
I'll put money the FBI releases her name as a suspect within the hour.
This attack is about one thing... pushing Congress to pass the registry.
This team was created to put an end to the rogue group of agents within the CIA working on behalf of eight power players in America.
Today, that mission takes on this form... make sure S-322 goes down in flames.
That registry cannot happen.
We cannot allow the Collaborators to take the next step in their long-term plan.
You're talking about FBI agents and CIA operatives actively interfering with the democratic process.
Look, I know that we cross a lot of lines, but that's a big one.
The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.
The Collaborators took the gloves off first.
We're just following suit.
How does that fit in to their long-term plan?
And what is that plan?
Shouldn't that be what we're trying to figure out?
Well, we will when we have the luxury of time, but for now, we got to stop this bill.
It's been out of the Senate for months.
The House is the holdup.
We have a few things we need to figure out.
Where are the votes?
Who are the swings?
And how do we push this thing to defeat?
We also need to figure out who's framing Raina.
If they work for the Collaborators and we expose their hand in this, maybe we could reverse this wave of fear fueling the vote.
Good.
Take point on that.
The rest of you, huddle up.
This is now our war room.
Golden Boy's back in his element.
After watching you kick down doors and shoot guns, now you get to see what I can do.
This is the playing field.
435 votes decide the game.
So, how many Republicans do we need to flip to vote "no"?
Depends on how many Democrats we can flip to vote "no," too.
The Democrats are voting for the Muslim registry?
Shelby:
My state representative's a Democrat.
He voted for it.
Law and order's one of those issues that crosses party lines.
9/11, Iraq.
It's hard to vote against fear when fear's so fresh.
So, how do we I.D. our targets?
Good question.
Tough one, too.
This is a radioactive issue.
People will hide their votes until the last minute.
So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.
And how do we do that?
The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.
No, but I do.
No, no.
Go back.

Alex:
Ginny Kearns, ex-military.
And she was working the G20 as a security consultant.
She has to be connected to the AIC.
Gun for hire, maybe?
And if she had a partner, it has to be someone that she trusted.
Pull up K.A.s. Maybe I could recognize him, too.
Known associates.
Good idea.
I don't understand something, Raina.
The government covered up everything that happened at the G20.
They didn't release your name.
Why are the AIC after you?
Because I was investigating them, Alex.
It should have never been covered up.
Someone had to try to expose them.
- Raina...
- I called the other survivors.
I tried to put together the real story of what happened.
León Velez... you know him, right?

This is Tyler Dinucci, Baltimore P.D.

Clay:
All right, we've narrowed down the representatives who can make or break this vote.
The Honorable Kyle Stutz...
Republican, California.
When he supported marriage equality, activists tried to primary him, and they lost.
He will buck party lines again if we can give him a reason to.
Jihane Hassane...
Democrat, Michigan's third, a Sikh who needs to prove she's tough on terrorism.
Jim Kreigsman...
Democrat, Ohio.
He lost a son in Afghanistan.
Gold-plated NatSec credentials.
If we can get him, the rest of the Dems will fall in line.
And finally, Meredith Cardenas, the first and only member of the Republicans' Latina caucus, who understands Latinos could be the next ones in the cross hairs of this registry.
That's a lot of names and not much time.
We knew it was gonna be an uphill battle.
Let's not give up now.
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, you're with me.
How do we know they're the key votes?
I've got a friend in the Speaker's office who can tell us if we're on the right path.
You mean Henry Roarke's office?
That better be one hell of a friend.
His boss is a Collaborator.
The asset I've been working used to report on Capitol Hill lifestyle.
She can fill the gaps on our oppo work and tell us what we're missing.
Fold her in.
We can use all the help we can get.
Any luck I.D.'ing Raina's attacker?
We have a name...
Tony Vincent, a buddy from Ginny Kearns' unit in Afghanistan.
They found work together as hired hit men after their enlistment ended.
Alex and I will find this man, question him, and clear Raina's name.
Do it.
You worried?
Don't be.
I got you.
No, no.
Th-That's not it.
Um...
So, Raina told me she'd been in contact with León Velez, but he'd gone dark.
So, I made a few calls.
His landlord just found him an hour ago, dead in his bathtub.
Suicide.
They got to him, Owen.
The same people who are trying to get to Raina.
I...
I didn't want to alarm anyone, so...
No, no.
You're right not to.
We'll just let them do the work right now while we track down whoever killed León and attacked Raina.
All right?
Hey, you still have that friend in Capitol Hill Police?
I need credentials on Sasha Barinov, fast.
I can make the call.
- Is her record clear?
- Of course.
Good, because if she has any skeletons in her closet, they will find them.
Clay:
All right, everyone, the fate of 3 1/2 million Americans rests on us.
That's how many Muslims there are in this country.
The only people that can stop them from losing their civil liberty are standing in this room right now.
The vote's in six hours.
Let's get this done.
Good luck.
- Man:
That's not what we agreed upon...
- Shelby:
Guess someone's in a hurry.
It's a big day.
Places to be, civil liberties to erode.
So, what's the plan?
The registry is on track for an 8:00 p.m. vote, so we have little time to stop it.
We need to make sure the swing votes we I.D.'d will indeed swing.
Ryan:
Oh, Sasha's here.
Credentials came through.
I'll connect with her and see what she knows that we don't, all right?
I don't understand how we're gonna do this.
Even if we have all of the right names, what can we do to talk anyone into voting "no"?
I've got access to the President to offer.
You've got the purse strings of an important defense contractor.
And I will put a face on this registry and remind them of what really matters.
But first, we start with Felix Cordova.
Why would he help us?
He works for the enemy.
He's my friend.
I know him.
He'll play ball.
[Exhales sharply]
Looking for a better view of the foliage?
What do you think is waiting for us there?
Just a man who needs to answer a few questions.

Well, the land is in his name, power and water are running.
What if he doesn't talk?
This man is the only person who can point his finger at all the Collaborators.
He'll talk.
I'll make sure of it.
This seems easy for you.
I mean, I know you've taught this, but you haven't done anything like this in decades.

There's no way the guy I know believes in singling out an entire religion as the bad guy.
I'm not in charge.
Shelby:
You're an immigrant.
How can you come to this country and then work to deprive other immigrants of their rights?
You live in a bubble.
Elites like you don't understand the concerns of everyday Americans.
Says the guy with a family crest.
I am an everyday American.
Hey, we know you're in a bind here, Felix.
Publicly, you have to support your boss, but secretly, maybe you're hoping this whole registry goes down in flames.
We can help make that happen.
All you have to do is give us the names of the swing votes you're targeting to win.
We will do the rest.
No one will ever know.
Stutz?
Cardenas?
Kreigsman?
Mullen?
Hassane?
Who are we missing?
Tell us.
I can't.
I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.
I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.
And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.

Oh, not even a "hello"?
Clock's ticking.
My team needs to know what's happening with the vote.
Your names check out on my end, though you can take Mullen off the list.
Roarke finally okayed the money for a regional airport with his name on it.
Now even God couldn't change him to a "no."
Well, it's nice to see you in your element.
[Chuckles] Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.
We'll get there.
Grab me when you know more, okay?

Did you know this was gonna happen?
Am I just an asset you're working?
Not "just," no.
But an asset, first and foremost.
Look, people like us... we help each other out when we need it.
Doesn't mean everything else doesn't matter.
No, I guess it doesn't.

That's fair.
- Go.
- Okay.
Mullen's out.
That takes one name off the list, a name that we need.
If our math is right, we'll have to convince all of the remaining targets to vote "no."
What "Black Mirror" episode did we wake up in?
How can any American support the Muslim registry?
Shelby:
Most everyone I grew up with would.
My sorority sisters would.
Hell, once upon a time, I would have, too.
FBI work taught me better, but still, I understand.
You're apologizing for those people?
Those people are a part of this country.
If you ignore their voice, how can you expect them to hear yours?
Look, I'm not saying they're right.
I'm saying they have a right to their opinion.
Ah, the real America... two blond people arguing the merits of my freedom instead of letting me have it.

Details are just emerging from what appears to be a deadly terror attack on American soil in Dayton, Ohio, this morning, where a bomber struck the Gallow Green Shopping Center.
- Wait... wait here.
- At least 15 are dead and dozens wounded.
The Islamic Front has claimed credit for the Dayton attack.
Authorities believe they are close to identifying the actual bomber, who is described as a female wearing a hijab.
They are moving to identify her based on CCTV footage from the scene.
Looks like it's time to get you out of here.
- This attack comes after a long period
- Come on.
of a national soul-searching in the wake of the G20 crisis.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- What is the nature of terror in America?
What and who should we fear and why?
This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack
- from a more confident GOP.
- I don't get it.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?
How does this fit in to their endgame?
Could just be a terrorist attack.
- And we don't know it was them.
- Yes, we do.
...are necessary in order to protect this country...
Cache ping from last week.
A confidential white paper from the NSC, breaking down potential terror attacks against soft targets...
I-I looked into it, but nothing came of it.

I'm sorry to see that wasn't true.
Why bomb a mall?
To create panic?
To generate fear?
No.
To play politics.
Today at 8:00 p.m., the House of Representatives has a vote scheduled on S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
You mean the Muslim registry?
Technically, it's a system to allow Homeland to register and track non-citizen visa holders from countries of concern.
Those countries just happen to be exclusively Arab or Muslim.
But NEERS already failed twice.
Why now?
Terror, fear, spilt blood in the heartland, and a Muslim immigrant mastermind framed for the crime.
She has a name...
Raina Amin.
Raina came to us on the run from a team that staged her apartment to look like she could have planned an attack like this.
This isn't a coincidence.
We think she's being framed.
I'll put money the FBI releases her name as a suspect within the hour.
This attack is about one thing... pushing Congress to pass the registry.
This team was created to put an end to the rogue group of agents within the CIA working on behalf of eight power players in America.
Today, that mission takes on this form... make sure S-322 goes down in flames.
That registry cannot happen.
We cannot allow the Collaborators to take the next step in their long-term plan.
You're talking about FBI agents and CIA operatives actively interfering with the democratic process.
Look, I know that we cross a lot of lines, but that's a big one.
The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.
The Collaborators took the gloves off first.
We're just following suit.
How does that fit in to their long-term plan?
And what is that plan?
Shouldn't that be what we're trying to figure out?
Well, we will when we have the luxury of time, but for now, we got to stop this bill.
It's been out of the Senate for months.
The House is the holdup.
We have a few things we need to figure out.
Where are the votes?
Who are the swings?
And how do we push this thing to defeat?
We also need to figure out who's framing Raina.
If they work for the Collaborators and we expose their hand in this, maybe we could reverse this wave of fear fueling the vote.
Good.

It's hard to vote against fear when fear's so fresh.
So, how do we I.D. our targets?
Good question.
Tough one, too.
This is a radioactive issue.
People will hide their votes until the last minute.
So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.
And how do we do that?
The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.
No, but I do.
No, no.
Go back.
Her.
Ginny Kearns, ex-military.
And she was working the G20 as a security consultant.
She has to be connected to the AIC.
Gun for hire, maybe?
And if she had a partner, it has to be someone that she trusted.
Pull up K.A.s. Maybe I could recognize him, too.
Known associates.
Good idea.
I don't understand something, Raina.
The government covered up everything that happened at the G20.
They didn't release your name.
Why are the AIC after you?
Because I was investigating them, Alex.
It should have never been covered up.
Someone had to try to expose them.
- Raina...
- I called the other survivors.
I tried to put together the real story of what happened.
León Velez... you know him, right?
He was doing the same.
We were supposed to meet, but he never showed up.
Um, I think I should leave.
It's best if you stay.
I want to talk to you alone.
I'll be upstairs, and you'll be fine.
- I'm glad you're safe.
- Good.
Now that you know I'm safe, you can leave.
We haven't spoken for weeks, and that's all you have to say to me?
There's nothing left to say.
Look... all I wanted was to hear your voice.
If something had happened to you...
Something did happen to me, and I survived it without you.
I don't need you, Nimah.
And you need Alex?
I trust Alex.
And you can't trust me?
The person who used me at the G20, manipulated me, and lied to me?
I'm still your sister.
And you know very well who I am beneath my mistakes.
That's the problem.
Hey.
You okay?
Just came to change my clothes.
There's not much need for long johns if I'm gonna be hanging out in the bunker all day.
You look disappointed.
Who would've thought you liked to ski so much?
It bothers you.
I just don't believe it.
Why didn't I know about it?
Well, maybe you never asked.
- I'm...
I'm...
- I know.
Hello?
Alex Parrish?
This is Tyler Dinucci, Baltimore P.D.
I'm calling about León Velez.
All right, we've narrowed down the representatives who can make or break this vote.
The Honorable Kyle Stutz...
Republican, California.
When he supported marriage equality, activists tried to primary him, and they lost.
He will buck party lines again if we can give him a reason to.
Jihane Hassane...
Democrat, Michigan's third, a Sikh who needs to prove she's tough on terrorism.
Jim Kreigsman...
Democrat, Ohio.
He lost a son in Afghanistan.
Gold-plated NatSec credentials.
If we can get him, the rest of the Dems will fall in line.
And finally, Meredith Cardenas, the first and only member of the Republicans' Latina caucus, who understands Latinos could be the next ones in the cross hairs of this registry.
That's a lot of names and not much time.
We knew it was gonna be an uphill battle.
Let's not give up now.
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, you're with me.
How do we know they're the key votes?
I've got a friend in the Speaker's office who can tell us if we're on the right path.
You mean Henry Roarke's office?
That better be one hell of a friend.
His boss is a Collaborator.
The asset I've been working used to report on Capitol Hill lifestyle.
She can fill the gaps on our oppo work and tell us what we're missing.
Fold her in.
We can use all the help we can get.
Any luck I.D.'ing Raina's attacker?
We have a name...
Tony Vincent, a buddy from Ginny Kearns' unit in Afghanistan.
They found work together as hired hit men after their enlistment ended.
Alex and I will find this man, question him, and clear Raina's name.
Do it.
You worried?
Don't be.
I got you.
No, no.
Th-That's not it.
Um...
So, Raina told me she'd been in contact with León Velez, but he'd gone dark.
So, I made a few calls.
His landlord just found him an hour ago, dead in his bathtub.
Suicide.
They got to him, Owen.
The same people who are trying to get to Raina.
I...
I didn't want to alarm anyone, so...
No, no.
You're right not to.
We'll just let them do the work right now while we track down whoever killed León and attacked Raina.
All right?
Hey, you still have that friend in Capitol Hill Police?
I need credentials on Sasha Barinov, fast.
I can make the call.
- Is her record clear?
- Of course.
Good, because if she has any skeletons in her closet, they will find them.
All right, everyone, the fate of 3 1/2 million Americans rests on us.
That's how many Muslims there are in this country.
The only people that can stop them from losing their civil liberty are standing in this room right now.
The vote's in six hours.
Let's get this done.
Good luck.
- That's not what we agreed upon...
- Guess someone's in a hurry.
It's a big day.
Places to be, civil liberties to erode.
So, what's the plan?
The registry is on track for an 8:00 p.m. vote, so we have little time to stop it.
We need to make sure the swing votes we I.D.'d will indeed swing.
Oh, Sasha's here.
Credentials came through.
I'll connect with her and see what she knows that we don't, all right?
I don't understand how we're gonna do this.
Even if we have all of the right names, what can we do to talk anyone into voting "no"?
I've got access to the President to offer.
You've got the purse strings of an important defense contractor.
And I will put a face on this registry and remind them of what really matters.
But first, we start with Felix Cordova.
Why would he help us?
He works for the enemy.
He's my friend.
I know him.
He'll play ball.
Looking for a better view of the foliage?
What do you think is waiting for us there?
Just a man who needs to answer a few questions.
That's all.
How do we know Vincent's even there?
Well, the land is in his name, power and water are running.
What if he doesn't talk?
This man is the only person who can point his finger at all the Collaborators.
He'll talk.
I'll make sure of it.
This seems easy for you.
I mean, I know you've taught this, but you haven't done anything like this in decades.
Well, that's why it's so easy.
I've spent 20 years with my wings clipped, not being allowed to be the man I knew I really was.
Now I can.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Big day.
You brought friends.
And you are...
Nimah Amin.
Would you like me to spell this for your little registry?
You're funny.
It's not funny to us.
And it shouldn't be to you, either.
There's no way the guy I know believes in singling out an entire religion as the bad guy.
I'm not in charge.
You're an immigrant.
How can you come to this country and then work to deprive other immigrants of their rights?
You live in a bubble.
Elites like you don't understand the concerns of everyday Americans.
Says the guy with a family crest.
I am an everyday American.
Hey, we know you're in a bind here, Felix.
Publicly, you have to support your boss, but secretly, maybe you're hoping this whole registry goes down in flames.
We can help make that happen.
All you have to do is give us the names of the swing votes you're targeting to win.
We will do the rest.
No one will ever know.
Stutz?
Cardenas?
Kreigsman?
Mullen?
Hassane?
Who are we missing?
Tell us.
I can't.
I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.
I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.
And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.
Let's move.
Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.
I'll wait for your funeral, you right-wing sellout.
Hands where I can see them.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
You're about to find out.
Hey.
What's the word?
Oh, not even a "hello"?
Clock's ticking.
My team needs to know what's happening with the vote.
Your names check out on my end, though you can take Mullen off the list.
Roarke finally okayed the money for a regional airport with his name on it.
Now even God couldn't change him to a "no."
Well, it's nice to see you in your element.
Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.
We'll get there.
Grab me when you know more, okay?
Did you know this was gonna happen?
Am I just an asset you're working?
Not "just," no.
But an asset, first and foremost.
Look, people like us... we help each other out when we need it.
Doesn't mean everything else doesn't matter.
No, I guess it doesn't.
- I got to go, okay?
- Mm-mh.
- When this is over with...
- The lift tickets are on you?
That's fair.
- Go.
- Okay.
Mullen's out.
That takes one name off the list, a name that we need.
If our math is right, we'll have to convince all of the remaining targets to vote "no."
What "Black Mirror" episode did we wake up in?
How can any American support the Muslim registry?
Most everyone I grew up with would.
My sorority sisters would.
Hell, once upon a time, I would have, too.
FBI work taught me better, but still, I understand.
You're apologizing for those people?
Those people are a part of this country.
If you ignore their voice, how can you expect them to hear yours?
Look, I'm not saying they're right.
I'm saying they have a right to their opinion.
Ah, the real America... two blond people arguing the merits of my freedom instead of letting me have it.
The fact that this is even happening is an atrocity.
We've learned nothing from history.
Turn those votes.
Ms. Wyatt, I'm not afraid to cross the aisle when it matters, but the nation is already reacting on both sides.
Pro- and anti-Muslim protests are already forming.
I can't afford to alienate my base.
You won't be if you give your district a big enough win on the employment front... say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant and a thousand jobs to go with it.
I have to worry about my job first.
I just can't take the risk.
My apologies.
I'm not just a Sikh or a woman.
I'm a red-state Democrat.
That's three strikes.
The last thing I can do at a time like this is vote my conscience over my constituents.
Well, you may not want your faith to define you, but this bill defines my people by theirs.
- How is that okay?
- I'm sorry.
I've made it too far to lose it all now.
Look, Congressman, you know me.
I briefed President Todd on the threats of Islamic terror.
I've personally had boots on the ground in these countries.
I know a dangerous policy when I see one.
- A list isn't dangerous.
- No, in and of itself, no, it's not, okay?
But when you create a list, you're also creating a recruitment tool.
It's making it easier for a kid to choose a life of suicide vests over anything else.
Believe me when I tell you this is making us more vulnerable, not less.
America is scared, and so am I.
They want action.
My vote is "yes," and I'm not sorry.
Why is it every time a Muslim kills someone in this country, he's a terrorist, but, you know, if a white man does it, he's simply disturbed?
Save that claptrap for your buddies in the lamestream media.
My vote's "yes," and it's rock-solid.
Your mother should know better than sending you in here like this.
It's embarrassing.
This is impossible.
No one's budging.
If these are the swing votes, we're screwed.
- What's the play?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
- I thought you were the speech writer...
- Hello?
...strategist of our generation.
Jon Favreau would know what to do.
Maybe we should call him.
You have a problem.
What's wrong?
FBI counterintelligence has Sasha Barinov flagged as a possible FSB asset.
She's not a Russian spy.
Well, my Capitol Police friend just heard back from the FBI after helping us with Sasha's credentials.
I thought you should know.
Sir, we've received a complaint and have been instructed to escort you out of the building.
Complaint?
From whom?
Felix.
He sent us after the wrong congressmen.
Did you have a nice field trip today?
It's nothing personal, just politics.
But I want to say thanks.
I had a lot of undecideds who hate your mother, and seeing you do her dirty work helped bring them home.
It won't even be a narrow margin now.
Sir, we have to go.
Come on.
Who do you work for?
You're gonna find out yourself the longer you keep me here.
Did you kill León Velez?
Frame Raina Amin?
That was you in Central Park.
You put Rebecca Sherman up to that?
That's a "yes."
You better stop asking questions and start answering them.
No.
You better get out of here.
I messed up.
They'll be coming for me.
They?
Who's they?
How'd you mess up?
The cops were supposed to find Amin's body in the mall.
She got away.
The people who hired me are gonna find me and kill me unless you let me grab my go-bag and we all get out of here.
You let me go and I will tell you everything... who I work for, who's next on their list.
Harry Doyle...
He's still alive!
Two shooters, maybe three.
- Who's out there?
Who hired you?
- Cut me loose and I'll tell you.
- Tell us now!
- Or what...
What do we do now?
Owen?
Owen, we need a plan!
I know.
Just...
let me think.
Owen, listen to me.
Break Tony's restraints.
Put your gun in his hand.
I'll cover you.
I got it.
How'd it go?
Did what I give you help?
- Oh, can't use it.
- Why not?
Well, because I don't know if I can trust you.
Why does the FBI have you flagged as a Russian asset?
- That's ridiculous.
- No, no, no.
You don't get on that list without a major paper trail to back it up.
They know something.
Who are you?
- Ryan, you're scaring me.
- You better start talking right now.
- I'm leaving.
- Are you working me?
Did you compromise me?
Who do you work for?
It's not what you think.
You're watching the House Session vote on bill S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
Bombónes?
My mother sends them every week.
No?
Okay.
Even if I wanted to stop this vote... and I don't... it's already happening.
We won.
You can get on the phone, beg, plead, lie.
They will listen to you because they'll think you disagree with Roarke.
Why would I do that?
Because there's more at stake than we can tell you... and because deep down, you know that singling out an entire faith is wrong.
Okay.
Okay, what if I tell you one of the chocolates in this bowl could kill you?
Would you play it safe?
Or would you take a chance and grab one?
These are people we're talking about, not cheap political props.
It wasn't my choice.
I hated Russia, what they do to their people.
I got out as soon as I could, but my parents are still there.
They're too poor to leave, too weak to protect themselves.
All I have to do is help the FSB with a little information from time to time and they stay safe.
That's all.
Did you tell them about me?
Of course not.
I would never.
Ryan, please, you have to believe me.
You grew up here... with real freedom, without fear.
You don't know what this is like.
I've seen firsthand what people will do to protect the ones that they love.
I know you're not lying.
I know who you are.
Mr. Cordova...
Felix.
You're from Madrid, right?
Your father is the ambassador to the United States.
So?
You lived in Madrid in '04.
What are you still doing here?
If memory serves, your sister... she died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.
Okay, this is not about my sister.
All hate comes from somewhere.
I do not hate, Ms. Amin.
I just know myself what terrorism can do if it's not eradicated.
So do I!
So do I.
It can spur violence against innocent men and women, destroy families, stoke imaginary fears against the other.
It's already too late.
S-322 passes by six votes.
It's out of our hands and into the President's now.
The president will veto it.
That's what I told Roarke.
He said he doesn't care.
Of course.
That's what this is about.
This is about keeping America safe...
Shut up.
Excuse me.
- We have to leave right now.
- Why?
They identified the bomber.
I know what you're gonna say.
We're safe now.
- Doesn't matter.
- I got in my head and you didn't.
I got grounded years ago because of a simple mistake.
I always told myself it was a fluke, could have happened to anybody, but it didn't.
It happened to me... because I screwed up.
And I've spent all the years since then landlocked on the Farm, safe from discovering what we both learned today... that I don't have what it takes when it comes down to it.
That is not true.
I'm not the man I wish I was.
Where are we?
Where are we?
We failed.
Raina Amin's been framed, a bill to create a Muslim registry is sitting on the President's desk waiting to be signed, and the worst part is, we never stood a chance to stop it.
This has always been about Claire, always has been.
She's what the Collaborators want.
I mean, this... this isn't about religious freedom or... or liberty.
It's about forcing the last person standing in their way to veto this bill, which they know that she will.
Whatever happens next will be perceived as her fault.
I should have seen this coming.
These people planted the seeds for this for months, years.
I mean, they're playing chess, and we can't even find the board.
Where are you going?
I have to call the President.
- What's this?
- Our room.
- I'm not living with you.
- You have no choice.
As far as the world's concerned, you're guilty of that bombing.
If you leave the Farm now, you're as good as done.
At least here I can keep you safe.
I'm trapped... again.
And again, it's because of you, Nimah.
If I leave now,
I'm gonna have to pay for a crime that I did not commit.
And if I stay here, I'll be in prison anyway.
What if I turn myself in?
For a bombing they said I did?
Just until this team proves you're innocent.
I'll be you in custody, and you'll be me, free in the world, helping fix it.
You would really do this for me?
You just said you're in this situation because of me.
Let me take the hard part.
- Nimah, you can't...
- Please... let me fix this.
Going somewhere?
Are you in trouble?
I could ask you the same question.
My asset didn't get flagged by the CIA as a Russian spy.
Well, Sasha hasn't been accused of any crime.
She doesn't have to be.
She's compromised, Ryan.
You have to drop her.
- What?
What?
Say it.
- Well, no, Sa...
No, Sasha's compromised because she's on some list somewhere?
The same way that your little backpacking buddy from India,
Amir Salaam, was on a list?
Does that make him compromised?
Does your association with him make you compromised?
You're putting all of us at risk.
Look, I'm not your soldier, Alex.
I'm not your asset, and I'm not your fiancé.
You think Sasha's trouble?
Okay.
I'll be careful.
The rest is up to me.
And with this veto,
President Haas sends a clear message to the American people.
"You're on your own."
Now, the rich are safe in their mansions and their gated communities, but common, everyday Americans are left to fend for themselves, unsure of when the next jihadist will strike.
And when they do...
and they will, mark my words... it will be on that woman's shoulders.
And when that happens, you ask her...
That wasn't just rhetoric.
Roarke's laying out his game plan.
Sooner or later, the Collaborators will stage another attack, and when they do, your mother will be done.
Her V.P. nominee has languished in the Senate for weeks now.
It's not hard to see why.
If she resigns... when she resigns... we all know who's next in succession.
The Speaker of the House...
Henry Roarke.
A Collaborator as President.
They'll have it all.
I know that veto hurts Claire in the short term, but it was the right thing.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You tried to talk her into signing it.
She didn't listen.
Wow.
I am disappointed.
Days like this... they show you what you're really made of.
Now I know.
So do you.
I know that Congress is willing and able to work with this President to help Americans, but she needs to be willing to work with us, the majority Americans elected to protect them... to protect their interests.
We will not back down.
You're right.
I should have a plaque made.
Someone took my booth.
Something happen?
More than what's already happened?
No.
- Just some friendly fire.
- Ryan.
- How'd you...
- I can see it on your face.
I might think twice out in the field, but I've been reading people in the classroom since the Clinton years.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Wow.
Look at us, smiling after almost being killed today.
Here.
And toasting while Rome is burning.
To our own cleverness, instead of being honest with ourselves.
Alex, I froze today.
I thought too much.
- No, don't.
- My instinct...
No.
My instinct is gone.
Now, you...
I mean, you have...
you have doubts.
We've been over that.
But you act first.
If I'm gonna make it out of here alive,
I need to learn to do the same.
And I think maybe you're the one to teach me.
Me help you?
That's...
What a smart man does who knows his limits... asks for the help he knows he needs.
So... help me.
Help me trust myself again.
Help me be... who I was... instead of who I am right now.
The finest Pinot grigio that your local supermarket sells.
Mm.
Funny.
I pegged you as more of an Old World red kind of guy.
I don't even know what that means.
Is the FBI right behind you?
Well, if they are, they're after me, not you.
I'm trusting you, until you give me a reason not to.
Trusting is a very stupid and dangerous habit, and yet I keep doing it.
You put your neck on the line to protect the people you love.
You shouldn't have to pay for that.
You gonna open that or what?
Caleb, it's Shelby.
I know you probably don't want to hear this, but I think your family needs you right now.
Proud of yourself?
No.
But my boss and my father are.
I'm sorry, Clay.
It isn't personal.
Yeah, that's the problem with your side.
It never is, and it should be.
I know what he's doing.
You didn't have a chance to win this.
When I find something you can, I will let you know.
Remember... always to the right.
I won't let them know we switched.
You will get me out of there as soon as you can, right?
Previously on "Quantico"...
The AIC is the hand of a much larger body.
I'm forming a select team to fight it.
A covert joint-task force.
Roarke is the man in the government that we've been looking for.
That's the Speaker of the House.
Why'd you leave Russia?
This isn't first-date material.
We're just worried about you.
Yeah, well, you should be worried about me getting killed.
Raina still hasn't spoken to me, and I don't know if she ever will.
I don't want to die for this.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Harry.
You okay?
Need a minute?
You want some water?
I missed you, too, Felix.
You're also missing a lot of shots.
I guess you only knew your way around a court when you used it to hook up.
It was boarding school.
You were there...
Squash courts were the only place to take girls on campus without people finding you.
I hope you were better at that than you are at this.
Serve.
How is the Iron Mommy?
The President is good.
And the Sith Lord?
The Speaker of the House is happy, rested, and ready for a big day.
I'd heard Roarke was bringing the Muslim registry back to a vote.
I mean, I get it.
It's gone down twice.
Why not make it a TKO?
We need to keep your country safe.
Henry believes extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.
- And what do you believe?
- Whatever he does.
He's the boss.
You're a senior legislative assistant to the Speaker.
That's a very big deal.
You've been there for a year.
You have to know who your boss really is by now.
You really want to hitch your wagon to that horse?
You won't be happy till I'm a Democrat.
You used to be one.
I'm just looking out for you.
Well, you should be looking out for yourself.
I heard everything about your new co-worker.
Maxine talked about Shelby?
Better me than a mediator.
I can't believe we're going back into the real world.
I just wish we didn't have to.
But after what happened in New York, we can't expect the Collaborators will hit the cache anytime soon, so we have to go back to our cover lives.
Adios, muchachas.
Ooh.
Shelby, do you still have those ski gloves?
- Have fun freezing your butt off.
- Thank you.
Ski gloves?
Since when do you ski?
I don't know.
Since high school.
This is a prank.
Is this a prank?
'Cause he doesn't ski.
You don't ski.
Well, I guess you never really know someone, do you?
And who's gonna wear these dainty little things?
I'm pretty sure it's not you.
An asset I'm developing...
a reporter from the Journal.
The one who exposed Sean Gregory?
Well, someone's got to find out how that happened.
See you next time the world explodes.
Since when does Ryan ski?
Um, your ex-fiancé is most likely dating someone for the first time since you...
a likely asset... and that is your headline?
I just thought I knew everything about him.
You can never know everything about anybody.
We just learn what we learn as we learn it.
There's always more.
Yeah, I could definitely use a break from this fishbowl.
It does things to your head.
You know, it's... it's not the bowl.
It's the fish.
I will be away from him, too.
You stay at summer camp too long, you end up regretting something.
Now all I need is a 90-minute massage and six hours at the gun range, and I will be back to the real me.
Call me when you get to New York.
Will do.
Wow.
You should really have a plaque on this booth.
Same breakfast every day, same place, same time.
Are you saying I'm boring?
I would never do that.
I just think you're predictable.
What are you doing here?
Well, Nimah asked me to meet her, but she's not here yet.
Well, have a seat.
Right.
Thanks.
So, how was your visit?
Well, we talked... technically.
I-I wouldn't say we used full sentences.
Lydia didn't have a lot to say?
No.
I'm the one who didn't have anything to say.
I can't ask her what I really need to know.
Was it my fault?
Did I make her into this person?
Did she just make a mistake?
Is this who she really is?
Anyway, you must be excited.
You all get to go back to your lives.
You've got your fancy New York apartment.
Shelby has her D.C. townhouse.
Harry has... whatever it is he ran away to.
But me?
This is my life.
No friends, fractured family.
Hey, look, I could, um...
I could stay for a while.
Thanks, but I'll see you when you get back.
Okay, sure.
Wow.
Rebuffed again.
I told you you were predictable.
Alex... go home.
At least you still can.
Nimah?
What are you doing here?
Didn't you see me walk in?
Is he gone?
Owen?
Yeah.
Give me a second, okay?
Hello?
I went to see Raina.
She isn't here.
Her apartment is full of anti-American propaganda, blueprints for a shopping center, bomb components.
It looks exactly like yours did last year.
I-I don't know where she is.
I do, and she's safe.
Let me call you right back, okay?
Your sister's really worried about you...
Raina.
I've never done something like this before.
What, ski?
It's easy.
It's expensive, but it's easy.
No.
Going away with a man I've only had a half a date with.
Locked away for the whole weekend with no distractions, it means that we'll get to know the real us faster.
And we'll spend a whole ton of money getting cold, wet, and bruised up in the process.
Sound good?
Sure.
Let's do it again soon.
Definitely.
Have fun cleaning President Mom's boots.
Say "hi" to Voldemort for me.
What's going on?
Are you in trouble?
What happened to your hijab?
I was attacked.
A man and a woman... they put things in my apartment, Alex.
I think they're trying to frame me.
We interrupt with breaking news.
Details are just emerging from what appears to be a deadly terror attack on American soil in Dayton, Ohio, this morning, where a bomber struck the Gallow Green Shopping Center.
- Wait... wait here.
- At least 15 are dead and dozens wounded.
The Islamic Front has claimed credit for the Dayton attack.
Authorities believe they are close to identifying the actual bomber, who is described as a female wearing a hijab.
They are moving to identify her based on CCTV footage from the scene.
Looks like it's time to get you out of here.
- This attack comes after a long period
- Come on.
Of a national soul-searching in the wake of the G20 crisis.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- What is the nature of terror in America?
What and who should we fear and why?
This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack
- from a more confident GOP.
- I don't get it.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?
How does this fit in to their endgame?
Could just be a terrorist attack.
- And we don't know it was them.
- Yes, we do.
Are necessary in order to protect this country...
Cache ping from last week.
A confidential white paper from the NSC, breaking down potential terror attacks against soft targets...
I-I looked into it, but nothing came of it.
So, I figured it was part of a plan they abandoned.
I'm sorry to see that wasn't true.
Why bomb a mall?
To create panic?
To generate fear?
No.
To play politics.
Today at 8:00 p.m., the House of Representatives has a vote scheduled on S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
You mean the Muslim registry?
Technically, it's a system to allow Homeland to register and track non-citizen visa holders from countries of concern.
Those countries just happen to be exclusively Arab or Muslim.
But NEERS already failed twice.
Why now?
Terror, fear, spilt blood in the heartland, and a Muslim immigrant mastermind framed for the crime.
She has a name...
Raina Amin.
Raina came to us on the run from a team that staged her apartment to look like she could have planned an attack like this.
This isn't a coincidence.
We think she's being framed.
I'll put money the FBI releases her name as a suspect within the hour.
This attack is about one thing... pushing Congress to pass the registry.
This team was created to put an end to the rogue group of agents within the CIA working on behalf of eight power players in America.
Today, that mission takes on this form... make sure S-322 goes down in flames.
That registry cannot happen.
We cannot allow the Collaborators to take the next step in their long-term plan.
You're talking about FBI agents and CIA operatives actively interfering with the democratic process.
Look, I know that we cross a lot of lines, but that's a big one.
The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.
The Collaborators took the gloves off first.
We're just following suit.
How does that fit in to their long-term plan?
And what is that plan?
Shouldn't that be what we're trying to figure out?
Well, we will when we have the luxury of time, but for now, we got to stop this bill.
It's been out of the Senate for months.
The House is the holdup.
We have a few things we need to figure out.
Where are the votes?
Who are the swings?
And how do we push this thing to defeat?
We also need to figure out who's framing Raina.
If they work for the Collaborators and we expose their hand in this, maybe we could reverse this wave of fear fueling the vote.
Good.
Take point on that.
The rest of you, huddle up.
This is now our war room.
Golden Boy's back in his element.
After watching you kick down doors and shoot guns, now you get to see what I can do.
This is the playing field.
435 votes decide the game.
So, how many Republicans do we need to flip to vote "no"?
Depends on how many Democrats we can flip to vote "no," too.
The Democrats are voting for the Muslim registry?
My state representative's a Democrat.
He voted for it.
Law and order's one of those issues that crosses party lines.
9/11, Iraq.
It's hard to vote against fear when fear's so fresh.
So, how do we I.D. our targets?
Good question.
Tough one, too.
This is a radioactive issue.
People will hide their votes until the last minute.
So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.
And how do we do that?
The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.
No, but I do.
No, no.
Go back.
Her.
Ginny Kearns, ex-military.
And she was working the G20 as a security consultant.
She has to be connected to the AIC.
Gun for hire, maybe?
And if she had a partner, it has to be someone that she trusted.
Pull up K.A.s. Maybe I could recognize him, too.
Known associates.
Good idea.
I don't understand something, Raina.
The government covered up everything that happened at the G20.
They didn't release your name.
Why are the AIC after you?
Because I was investigating them, Alex.
It should have never been covered up.
Someone had to try to expose them.
- Raina...
- I called the other survivors.
I tried to put together the real story of what happened.
León Velez... you know him, right?
He was doing the same.
We were supposed to meet, but he never showed up.
Um, I think I should leave.
It's best if you stay.
I want to talk to you alone.
I'll be upstairs, and you'll be fine.
- I'm glad you're safe.
- Good.
Now that you know I'm safe, you can leave.
We haven't spoken for weeks, and that's all you have to say to me?
There's nothing left to say.
Look... all I wanted was to hear your voice.
If something had happened to you...
Something did happen to me, and I survived it without you.
I don't need you, Nimah.
And you need Alex?
I trust Alex.
And you can't trust me?
The person who used me at the G20, manipulated me, and lied to me?
I'm still your sister.
And you know very well who I am beneath my mistakes.
That's the problem.
Hey.
You okay?
Just came to change my clothes.
There's not much need for long johns if I'm gonna be hanging out in the bunker all day.
You look disappointed.
Who would've thought you liked to ski so much?
It bothers you.
I just don't believe it.
Why didn't I know about it?
Well, maybe you never asked.
- I'm...
I'm...
- I know.
Hello?
Alex Parrish?
This is Tyler Dinucci, Baltimore P.D.
I'm calling about León Velez.
All right, we've narrowed down the representatives who can make or break this vote.
The Honorable Kyle Stutz...
Republican, California.
When he supported marriage equality, activists tried to primary him, and they lost.
He will buck party lines again if we can give him a reason to.
Jihane Hassane...
Democrat, Michigan's third, a Sikh who needs to prove she's tough on terrorism.
Jim Kreigsman...
Democrat, Ohio.
He lost a son in Afghanistan.
Gold-plated NatSec credentials.
If we can get him, the rest of the Dems will fall in line.
And finally, Meredith Cardenas, the first and only member of the Republicans' Latina caucus, who understands Latinos could be the next ones in the cross hairs of this registry.
That's a lot of names and not much time.
We knew it was gonna be an uphill battle.
Let's not give up now.
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, you're with me.
How do we know they're the key votes?
I've got a friend in the Speaker's office who can tell us if we're on the right path.
You mean Henry Roarke's office?
That better be one hell of a friend.
His boss is a Collaborator.
The asset I've been working used to report on Capitol Hill lifestyle.
She can fill the gaps on our oppo work and tell us what we're missing.
Fold her in.
We can use all the help we can get.
Any luck I.D.'ing Raina's attacker?
We have a name...
Tony Vincent, a buddy from Ginny Kearns' unit in Afghanistan.
They found work together as hired hit men after their enlistment ended.
Alex and I will find this man, question him, and clear Raina's name.
Do it.
You worried?
Don't be.
I got you.
No, no.
Th-That's not it.
Um...
So, Raina told me she'd been in contact with León Velez, but he'd gone dark.
So, I made a few calls.
His landlord just found him an hour ago, dead in his bathtub.
Suicide.
They got to him, Owen.
The same people who are trying to get to Raina.
I...
I didn't want to alarm anyone, so...
No, no.
You're right not to.
We'll just let them do the work right now while we track down whoever killed León and attacked Raina.
All right?
Hey, you still have that friend in Capitol Hill Police?
I need credentials on Sasha Barinov, fast.
I can make the call.
- Is her record clear?
- Of course.
Good, because if she has any skeletons in her closet, they will find them.
All right, everyone, the fate of 3 1/2 million Americans rests on us.
That's how many Muslims there are in this country.
The only people that can stop them from losing their civil liberty are standing in this room right now.
The vote's in six hours.
Let's get this done.
Good luck.
- That's not what we agreed upon...
- Guess someone's in a hurry.
It's a big day.
Places to be, civil liberties to erode.
So, what's the plan?
The registry is on track for an 8:00 p.m. vote, so we have little time to stop it.
We need to make sure the swing votes we I.D.'d will indeed swing.
Sasha's here.
Credentials came through.
I'll connect with her and see what she knows that we don't, all right?
I don't understand how we're gonna do this.
Even if we have all of the right names, what can we do to talk anyone into voting "no"?
I've got access to the President to offer.
You've got the purse strings of an important defense contractor.
And I will put a face on this registry and remind them of what really matters.
But first, we start with Felix Cordova.
Why would he help us?
He works for the enemy.
He's my friend.
I know him.
He'll play ball.
Looking for a better view of the foliage?
What do you think is waiting for us there?
Just a man who needs to answer a few questions.
That's all.
How do we know Vincent's even there?
Well, the land is in his name, power and water are running.
What if he doesn't talk?
This man is the only person who can point his finger at all the Collaborators.
He'll talk.
I'll make sure of it.
This seems easy for you.
I mean, I know you've taught this, but you haven't done anything like this in decades.
Well, that's why it's so easy.
I've spent 20 years with my wings clipped, not being allowed to be the man I knew I really was.
Now I can.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Big day.
You brought friends.
And you are...
Nimah Amin.
Would you like me to spell this for your little registry?
You're funny.
It's not funny to us.
And it shouldn't be to you, either.
There's no way the guy I know believes in singling out an entire religion as the bad guy.
I'm not in charge.
You're an immigrant.
How can you come to this country and then work to deprive other immigrants of their rights?
You live in a bubble.
Elites like you don't understand the concerns of everyday Americans.
Says the guy with a family crest.
I am an everyday American.
Hey, we know you're in a bind here, Felix.
Publicly, you have to support your boss, but secretly, maybe you're hoping this whole registry goes down in flames.
We can help make that happen.
All you have to do is give us the names of the swing votes you're targeting to win.
We will do the rest.
No one will ever know.
Stutz?
Cardenas?
Kreigsman?
Mullen?
Hassane?
Who are we missing?
Tell us.
I can't.
I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.
I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.
And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.
Let's move.
Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.
I'll wait for your funeral, you right-wing sellout.
Hands where I can see them.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
You're about to find out.
Hey.
What's the word?
Not even a "hello"?
Clock's ticking.
My team needs to know what's happening with the vote.
Your names check out on my end, though you can take Mullen off the list.
Roarke finally okayed the money for a regional airport with his name on it.
Now even God couldn't change him to a "no."
Well, it's nice to see you in your element.
Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.
We'll get there.
Grab me when you know more, okay?
Did you know this was gonna happen?
Am I just an asset you're working?
Not "just," no.
But an asset, first and foremost.
Look, people like us... we help each other out when we need it.
Doesn't mean everything else doesn't matter.
No, I guess it doesn't.
- I got to go, okay?
- Mh.
- When this is over with...
- The lift tickets are on you?
That's fair.
- Go.
- Okay.
Mullen's out.
That takes one name off the list, a name that we need.
If our math is right, we'll have to convince all of the remaining targets to vote "no."
What "Black Mirror" episode did we wake up in?
How can any American support the Muslim registry?
Most everyone I grew up with would.
My sorority sisters would.
Hell, once upon a time, I would have, too.
FBI work taught me better, but still, I understand.
You're apologizing for those people?
Those people are a part of this country.
If you ignore their voice, how can you expect them to hear yours?
Look, I'm not saying they're right.
I'm saying they have a right to their opinion.
The real America... two blond people arguing the merits of my freedom instead of letting me have it.
The fact that this is even happening is an atrocity.
We've learned nothing from history.
Turn those votes.
Ms. Wyatt, I'm not afraid to cross the aisle when it matters, but the nation is already reacting on both sides.
Pro- and anti-Muslim protests are already forming.
I can't afford to alienate my base.
You won't be if you give your district a big enough win on the employment front... say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant and a thousand jobs to go with it.
I have to worry about my job first.
I just can't take the risk.
My apologies.
I'm not just a Sikh or a woman.
I'm a red-state Democrat.
That's three strikes.
The last thing I can do at a time like this is vote my conscience over my constituents.
Well, you may not want your faith to define you, but this bill defines my people by theirs.
- How is that okay?
- I'm sorry.
I've made it too far to lose it all now.
Look, Congressman, you know me.
I briefed President Todd on the threats of Islamic terror.
I've personally had boots on the ground in these countries.
I know a dangerous policy when I see one.
- A list isn't dangerous.
- No, in and of itself, no, it's not, okay?
But when you create a list, you're also creating a recruitment tool.
It's making it easier for a kid to choose a life of suicide vests over anything else.
Believe me when I tell you this is making us more vulnerable, not less.
America is scared, and so am I.
They want action.
My vote is "yes," and I'm not sorry.
Why is it every time a Muslim kills someone in this country, he's a terrorist, but, you know, if a white man does it, he's simply disturbed?
Save that claptrap for your buddies in the lamestream media.
My vote's "yes," and it's rock-solid.
Your mother should know better than sending you in here like this.
It's embarrassing.
This is impossible.
No one's budging.
If these are the swing votes, we're screwed.
- What's the play?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
- I thought you were the speech writer...
- Hello?
Strategist of our generation.
Jon Favreau would know what to do.
Maybe we should call him.
You have a problem.
What's wrong?
FBI counterintelligence has Sasha Barinov flagged as a possible FSB asset.
She's not a Russian spy.
Well, my Capitol Police friend just heard back from the FBI after helping us with Sasha's credentials.
I thought you should know.
Sir, we've received a complaint and have been instructed to escort you out of the building.
Complaint?
From whom?
Felix.
He sent us after the wrong congressmen.
Did you have a nice field trip today?
It's nothing personal, just politics.
But I want to say thanks.
I had a lot of undecideds who hate your mother, and seeing you do her dirty work helped bring them home.
It won't even be a narrow margin now.
Sir, we have to go.
Come on.
Who do you work for?
You're gonna find out yourself the longer you keep me here.
Did you kill León Velez?
Frame Raina Amin?
That was you in Central Park.
You put Rebecca Sherman up to that?
That's a "yes."
You better stop asking questions and start answering them.
No.
You better get out of here.
I messed up.
They'll be coming for me.
They?
Who's they?
How'd you mess up?
The cops were supposed to find Amin's body in the mall.
She got away.
The people who hired me are gonna find me and kill me unless you let me grab my go-bag and we all get out of here.
You let me go and I will tell you everything... who I work for, who's next on their list.
Harry Doyle...
He's still alive!
Two shooters, maybe three.
- Who's out there?
Who hired you?
- Cut me loose and I'll tell you.
- Tell us now!
- Or what...
What do we do now?
Owen?
Owen, we need a plan!
I know.
Just...
let me think.
Owen, listen to me.
Break Tony's restraints.
Put your gun in his hand.
I'll cover you.
I got it.
How'd it go?
Did what I give you help?
- Can't use it.
- Why not?
Well, because I don't know if I can trust you.
Why does the FBI have you flagged as a Russian asset?
- That's ridiculous.
- No, no, no.
You don't get on that list without a major paper trail to back it up.
They know something.
Who are you?
- Ryan, you're scaring me.
- You better start talking right now.
- I'm leaving.
- Are you working me?
Did you compromise me?
Who do you work for?
It's not what you think.
You're watching the House Session vote on bill S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
Bombónes?
My mother sends them every week.
No?
Okay.
Even if I wanted to stop this vote... and I don't... it's already happening.
We won.
You can get on the phone, beg, plead, lie.
They will listen to you because they'll think you disagree with Roarke.
Why would I do that?
Because there's more at stake than we can tell you... and because deep down, you know that singling out an entire faith is wrong.
Okay.
Okay, what if I tell you one of the chocolates in this bowl could kill you?
Would you play it safe?
Or would you take a chance and grab one?
These are people we're talking about, not cheap political props.
It wasn't my choice.
I hated Russia, what they do to their people.
I got out as soon as I could, but my parents are still there.
They're too poor to leave, too weak to protect themselves.
All I have to do is help the FSB with a little information from time to time and they stay safe.
That's all.
Did you tell them about me?
Of course not.
I would never.
Ryan, please, you have to believe me.
You grew up here... with real freedom, without fear.
You don't know what this is like.
I've seen firsthand what people will do to protect the ones that they love.
I know you're not lying.
I know who you are.
Mr. Cordova...
Felix.
You're from Madrid, right?
Your father is the ambassador to the United States.
So?
You lived in Madrid in '04.
What are you still doing here?
If memory serves, your sister... she died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.
Okay, this is not about my sister.
All hate comes from somewhere.
I do not hate, Ms. Amin.
I just know myself what terrorism can do if it's not eradicated.
So do I!
So do I.
It can spur violence against innocent men and women, destroy families, stoke imaginary fears against the other.
It's already too late.
S-322 passes by six votes.
It's out of our hands and into the President's now.
The president will veto it.
That's what I told Roarke.
He said he doesn't care.
Of course.
That's what this is about.
This is about keeping America safe...
Shut up.
Excuse me.
- We have to leave right now.
- Why?
They identified the bomber.
I know what you're gonna say.
We're safe now.
- Doesn't matter.
- I got in my head and you didn't.
I got grounded years ago because of a simple mistake.
I always told myself it was a fluke, could have happened to anybody, but it didn't.
It happened to me... because I screwed up.
And I've spent all the years since then landlocked on the Farm, safe from discovering what we both learned today... that I don't have what it takes when it comes down to it.
That is not true.
I'm not the man I wish I was.
Where are we?
Where are we?
We failed.
Raina Amin's been framed, a bill to create a Muslim registry is sitting on the President's desk waiting to be signed, and the worst part is, we never stood a chance to stop it.
This has always been about Claire, always has been.
She's what the Collaborators want.
I mean, this... this isn't about religious freedom or... or liberty.
It's about forcing the last person standing in their way to veto this bill, which they know that she will.
Whatever happens next will be perceived as her fault.
I should have seen this coming.
These people planted the seeds for this for months, years.
I mean, they're playing chess, and we can't even find the board.
Where are you going?
I have to call the President.
- What's this?
- Our room.
- I'm not living with you.
- You have no choice.
As far as the world's concerned, you're guilty of that bombing.
If you leave the Farm now, you're as good as done.
At least here I can keep you safe.
I'm trapped... again.
And again, it's because of you, Nimah.
If I leave now,
I'm gonna have to pay for a crime that I did not commit.
And if I stay here, I'll be in prison anyway.
What if I turn myself in?
For a bombing they said I did?
Just until this team proves you're innocent.
I'll be you in custody, and you'll be me, free in the world, helping fix it.
You would really do this for me?
You just said you're in this situation because of me.
Let me take the hard part.
- Nimah, you can't...
- Please... let me fix this.
Going somewhere?
Are you in trouble?
I could ask you the same question.
My asset didn't get flagged by the CIA as a Russian spy.
Well, Sasha hasn't been accused of any crime.
She doesn't have to be.
She's compromised, Ryan.
You have to drop her.
- What?
What?
Say it.
- Well, no, Sa...
No, Sasha's compromised because she's on some list somewhere?
The same way that your little backpacking buddy from India,
Amir Salaam, was on a list?
Does that make him compromised?
Does your association with him make you compromised?
You're putting all of us at risk.
Look, I'm not your soldier, Alex.
I'm not your asset, and I'm not your fiancé.
You think Sasha's trouble?
Okay.
I'll be careful.
The rest is up to me.
And with this veto,
President Haas sends a clear message to the American people.
"You're on your own."
Now, the rich are safe in their mansions and their gated communities, but common, everyday Americans are left to fend for themselves, unsure of when the next jihadist will strike.
And when they do...
and they will, mark my words... it will be on that woman's shoulders.
And when that happens, you ask her...
That wasn't just rhetoric.
Roarke's laying out his game plan.
Sooner or later, the Collaborators will stage another attack, and when they do, your mother will be done.
Her V.P. nominee has languished in the Senate for weeks now.
It's not hard to see why.
If she resigns... when she resigns... we all know who's next in succession.
The Speaker of the House...
Henry Roarke.
A Collaborator as President.
They'll have it all.
I know that veto hurts Claire in the short term, but it was the right thing.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You tried to talk her into signing it.
She didn't listen.
Wow.
I am disappointed.
Days like this... they show you what you're really made of.
Now I know.
So do you.
I know that Congress is willing and able to work with this President to help Americans, but she needs to be willing to work with us, the majority Americans elected to protect them... to protect their interests.
We will not back down.
You're right.
I should have a plaque made.
Someone took my booth.
Something happen?
More than what's already happened?
No.
- Just some friendly fire.
- Ryan.
- How'd you...
- I can see it on your face.
I might think twice out in the field, but I've been reading people in the classroom since the Clinton years.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Wow.
Look at us, smiling after almost being killed today.
Here.
And toasting while Rome is burning.
To our own cleverness, instead of being honest with ourselves.
Alex, I froze today.
I thought too much.
- No, don't.
- My instinct...
No.
My instinct is gone.
Now, you...
I mean, you have...
you have doubts.
We've been over that.
But you act first.
If I'm gonna make it out of here alive,
I need to learn to do the same.
And I think maybe you're the one to teach me.
Me help you?
That's...
What a smart man does who knows his limits... asks for the help he knows he needs.
So... help me.
Help me trust myself again.
Help me be... who I was... instead of who I am right now.
The finest Pinot grigio that your local supermarket sells.
Funny.
I pegged you as more of an Old World red kind of guy.
I don't even know what that means.
Is the FBI right behind you?
Well, if they are, they're after me, not you.
I'm trusting you, until you give me a reason not to.
Trusting is a very stupid and dangerous habit, and yet I keep doing it.
You put your neck on the line to protect the people you love.
You shouldn't have to pay for that.
You gonna open that or what?
Caleb, it's Shelby.
I know you probably don't want to hear this, but I think your family needs you right now.
Proud of yourself?
No.
But my boss and my father are.
I'm sorry, Clay.
It isn't personal.
Yeah, that's the problem with your side.
It never is, and it should be.
I know what he's doing.
You didn't have a chance to win this.
When I find something you can, I will let you know.
Remember... always to the right.
I won't let them know we switched.
You will get me out of there as soon as you can, right?
Previously on "Quantico"...
The AIC is the hand of a much larger body.
I'm forming a select team to fight it.
A covert joint-task force.
Roarke is the man in the government that we've been looking for.
That's the Speaker of the House.
Why'd you leave Russia?
This isn't first-date material.
We're just worried about you.
Yeah, well, you should be worried about me getting killed.
Raina still hasn't spoken to me, and I don't know if she ever will.
I don't want to die for this.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Harry.
_
You okay?
Need a minute?
You want some water?
I missed you, too, Felix.
You're also missing a lot of shots.
I guess you only knew your way around a court when you used it to hook up.
It was boarding school.
You were there...
Squash courts were the only place to take girls on campus without people finding you.
I hope you were better at that than you are at this.
Serve.
How is the Iron Mommy?
The President is good.
And the Sith Lord?
The Speaker of the House is happy, rested, and ready for a big day.
I'd heard Roarke was bringing the Muslim registry back to a vote.
I mean, I get it.
It's gone down twice.
Why not make it a TKO?
We need to keep your country safe.
Henry believes extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.
- And what do you believe?
- Whatever he does.
He's the boss.
You're a senior legislative assistant to the Speaker.
That's a very big deal.
You've been there for a year.
You have to know who your boss really is by now.
You really want to hitch your wagon to that horse?
You won't be happy till I'm a Democrat.
You used to be one.
I'm just looking out for you.
Well, you should be looking out for yourself.
I heard everything about your new co-worker.
Maxine talked about Shelby?
Better me than a mediator.
I can't believe we're going back into the real world.
I just wish we didn't have to.
But after what happened in New York, we can't expect the Collaborators will hit the cache anytime soon, so we have to go back to our cover lives.
Adios, muchachas.
Ooh.
Shelby, do you still have those ski gloves?
- Have fun freezing your butt off.
- Thank you.
Ski gloves?
Since when do you ski?
I don't know.
Since high school.
This is a prank.
Is this a prank?
'Cause he doesn't ski.
You don't ski.
Well, I guess you never really know someone, do you?
And who's gonna wear these dainty little things?
I'm pretty sure it's not you.
An asset I'm developing...
a reporter from the Journal.
The one who exposed Sean Gregory?
Well, someone's got to find out how that happened.
See you next time the world explodes.
Since when does Ryan ski?
Um, your ex-fiancé is most likely dating someone for the first time since you...
a likely asset... and that is your headline?
I just thought I knew everything about him.
Oh, you can never know everything about anybody.
We just learn what we learn as we learn it.
There's always more.
Yeah, I could definitely use a break from this fishbowl.
It does things to your head.
You know, it's... it's not the bowl.
It's the fish.
I will be away from him, too.
You stay at summer camp too long, you end up regretting something.
Now all I need is a 90-minute massage and six hours at the gun range, and I will be back to the real me.
Call me when you get to New York.
Will do.
Wow.
You should really have a plaque on this booth.
Same breakfast every day, same place, same time.
Are you saying I'm boring?
I would never do that.
I just think you're predictable.
What are you doing here?
Well, Nimah asked me to meet her, but she's not here yet.
Well, have a seat.
Right.
Thanks.
So, how was your visit?
Well, we talked... technically.
I-I wouldn't say we used full sentences.
Lydia didn't have a lot to say, huh?
No.
I'm the one who didn't have anything to say.
I can't ask her what I really need to know.
Was it my fault?
Did I make her into this person?
Did she just make a mistake?
Is this who she really is?
Anyway, you must be excited.
You all get to go back to your lives.
You've got your fancy New York apartment.
Shelby has her D.C. townhouse.
Harry has... whatever it is he ran away to.
But me?
This is my life.
No friends, fractured family.
Hey, look, I could, um...
I could stay for a while.
Thanks, but I'll see you when you get back.
Okay, sure.
Wow.
Rebuffed again.
I told you you were predictable.
Alex... go home.
At least you still can.
Nimah?
What are you doing here?
Didn't you see me walk in?
Is he gone?
Owen?
Yeah.
Give me a second, okay?
Hello?
I went to see Raina.
She isn't here.
Her apartment is full of anti-American propaganda, blueprints for a shopping center, bomb components.
It looks exactly like yours did last year.
I-I don't know where she is.
I do, and she's safe.
Let me call you right back, okay?
Your sister's really worried about you...
Raina.
I've never done something like this before.
What, ski?
Oh, it's easy.
It's expensive, but it's easy.
No.
Going away with a man I've only had a half a date with.
Locked away for the whole weekend with no distractions, it means that we'll get to know the real us faster.
Ah.
And we'll spend a whole ton of money getting cold, wet, and bruised up in the process.
Sound good?
Sure.
_
Let's do it again soon.
Definitely.
Have fun cleaning President Mom's boots.
Say "hi" to Voldemort for me.
What's going on?
Are you in trouble?
What happened to your hijab?
I was attacked.
A man and a woman... they put things in my apartment, Alex.
I think they're trying to frame me.
We interrupt with breaking news.
Details are just emerging from what appears to be a deadly terror attack on American soil in Dayton, Ohio, this morning, where a bomber struck the Gallow Green Shopping Center.
- Wait... wait here.
- At least 15 are dead and dozens wounded.
The Islamic Front has claimed credit for the Dayton attack.
Authorities believe they are close to identifying the actual bomber, who is described as a female wearing a hijab.
They are moving to identify her based on CCTV footage from the scene.
Looks like it's time to get you out of here.
- This attack comes after a long period
- Come on.
of a national soul-searching in the wake of the G20 crisis.
- Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- What is the nature of terror in America?
What and who should we fear and why?
This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack
- from a more confident GOP.
- I don't get it.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?
How does this fit in to their endgame?
Could just be a terrorist attack.
- And we don't know it was them.
- Yes, we do.
...are necessary in order to protect this country...
Cache ping from last week.
A confidential white paper from the NSC, breaking down potential terror attacks against soft targets...
I-I looked into it, but nothing came of it.
So, I figured it was part of a plan they abandoned.
I'm sorry to see that wasn't true.
Why bomb a mall?
To create panic?
To generate fear?
No.
To play politics.
Today at 8:00 p.m., the House of Representatives has a vote scheduled on S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
You mean the Muslim registry?
Technically, it's a system to allow Homeland to register and track non-citizen visa holders from countries of concern.
Those countries just happen to be exclusively Arab or Muslim.
But NEERS already failed twice.
Why now?
Terror, fear, spilt blood in the heartland, and a Muslim immigrant mastermind framed for the crime.
She has a name...
Raina Amin.
Raina came to us on the run from a team that staged her apartment to look like she could have planned an attack like this.
This isn't a coincidence.
We think she's being framed.
I'll put money the FBI releases her name as a suspect within the hour.
This attack is about one thing... pushing Congress to pass the registry.
This team was created to put an end to the rogue group of agents within the CIA working on behalf of eight power players in America.
Today, that mission takes on this form... make sure S-322 goes down in flames.
That registry cannot happen.
We cannot allow the Collaborators to take the next step in their long-term plan.
You're talking about FBI agents and CIA operatives actively interfering with the democratic process.
Look, I know that we cross a lot of lines, but that's a big one.
The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.
The Collaborators took the gloves off first.
We're just following suit.
How does that fit in to their long-term plan?
And what is that plan?
Shouldn't that be what we're trying to figure out?
Well, we will when we have the luxury of time, but for now, we got to stop this bill.
It's been out of the Senate for months.
The House is the holdup.
We have a few things we need to figure out.
Where are the votes?
Who are the swings?
And how do we push this thing to defeat?
We also need to figure out who's framing Raina.
If they work for the Collaborators and we expose their hand in this, maybe we could reverse this wave of fear fueling the vote.
Good.
Take point on that.
The rest of you, huddle up.
This is now our war room.
Golden Boy's back in his element.
After watching you kick down doors and shoot guns, now you get to see what I can do.
This is the playing field.
435 votes decide the game.
So, how many Republicans do we need to flip to vote "no"?
Depends on how many Democrats we can flip to vote "no," too.
The Democrats are voting for the Muslim registry?
My state representative's a Democrat.
He voted for it.
Law and order's one of those issues that crosses party lines.
9/11, Iraq.
It's hard to vote against fear when fear's so fresh.
So, how do we I.D. our targets?
Good question.
Tough one, too.
This is a radioactive issue.
People will hide their votes until the last minute.
So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.
And how do we do that?
The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.
No, but I do.
No, no.
Go back.
Her.
Ginny Kearns, ex-military.
And she was working the G20 as a security consultant.
She has to be connected to the AIC.
Gun for hire, maybe?
And if she had a partner, it has to be someone that she trusted.
Pull up K.A.s. Maybe I could recognize him, too.
Known associates.
Good idea.
I don't understand something, Raina.
The government covered up everything that happened at the G20.
They didn't release your name.
Why are the AIC after you?
Because I was investigating them, Alex.
It should have never been covered up.
Someone had to try to expose them.
- Raina...
- I called the other survivors.
I tried to put together the real story of what happened.
León Velez... you know him, right?
He was doing the same.
We were supposed to meet, but he never showed up.
Um, I think I should leave.
It's best if you stay.
I want to talk to you alone.
I'll be upstairs, and you'll be fine.
- I'm glad you're safe.
- Good.
Now that you know I'm safe, you can leave.
We haven't spoken for weeks, and that's all you have to say to me?
There's nothing left to say.
Look... all I wanted was to hear your voice.
If something had happened to you...
Something did happen to me, and I survived it without you.
I don't need you, Nimah.
And you need Alex?
I trust Alex.
And you can't trust me?
The person who used me at the G20, manipulated me, and lied to me?
I'm still your sister.
And you know very well who I am beneath my mistakes.
That's the problem.
Hey.
You okay?
Just came to change my clothes.
There's not much need for long johns if I'm gonna be hanging out in the bunker all day.
You look disappointed.
Who would've thought you liked to ski so much?
It bothers you.
I just don't believe it.
Why didn't I know about it?
Well, maybe you never asked.
- I'm...
I'm...
- I know.
Hello?
Alex Parrish?
This is Tyler Dinucci, Baltimore P.D.
I'm calling about León Velez.
All right, we've narrowed down the representatives who can make or break this vote.
The Honorable Kyle Stutz...
Republican, California.
When he supported marriage equality, activists tried to primary him, and they lost.
He will buck party lines again if we can give him a reason to.
Jihane Hassane...
Democrat, Michigan's third, a Sikh who needs to prove she's tough on terrorism.
Jim Kreigsman...
Democrat, Ohio.
He lost a son in Afghanistan.
Gold-plated NatSec credentials.
If we can get him, the rest of the Dems will fall in line.
And finally, Meredith Cardenas, the first and only member of the Republicans' Latina caucus, who understands Latinos could be the next ones in the cross hairs of this registry.
That's a lot of names and not much time.
We knew it was gonna be an uphill battle.
Let's not give up now.
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, you're with me.
How do we know they're the key votes?
I've got a friend in the Speaker's office who can tell us if we're on the right path.
You mean Henry Roarke's office?
That better be one hell of a friend.
His boss is a Collaborator.
The asset I've been working used to report on Capitol Hill lifestyle.
She can fill the gaps on our oppo work and tell us what we're missing.
Fold her in.
We can use all the help we can get.
Any luck I.D.'ing Raina's attacker?
We have a name...
Tony Vincent, a buddy from Ginny Kearns' unit in Afghanistan.
They found work together as hired hit men after their enlistment ended.
Alex and I will find this man, question him, and clear Raina's name.
Do it.
You worried?
Don't be.
I got you.
No, no.
Th-That's not it.
Um...
So, Raina told me she'd been in contact with León Velez, but he'd gone dark.
So, I made a few calls.
His landlord just found him an hour ago, dead in his bathtub.
Suicide.
They got to him, Owen.
The same people who are trying to get to Raina.
I...
I didn't want to alarm anyone, so...
No, no.
You're right not to.
We'll just let them do the work right now while we track down whoever killed León and attacked Raina.
All right?
Hey, you still have that friend in Capitol Hill Police?
I need credentials on Sasha Barinov, fast.
I can make the call.
- Is her record clear?
- Of course.
Good, because if she has any skeletons in her closet, they will find them.
All right, everyone, the fate of 3 1/2 million Americans rests on us.
That's how many Muslims there are in this country.
The only people that can stop them from losing their civil liberty are standing in this room right now.
The vote's in six hours.
Let's get this done.
Good luck.
- That's not what we agreed upon...
- Guess someone's in a hurry.
It's a big day.
Places to be, civil liberties to erode.
So, what's the plan?
The registry is on track for an 8:00 p.m. vote, so we have little time to stop it.
We need to make sure the swing votes we I.D.'d will indeed swing.
Oh, Sasha's here.
Credentials came through.
I'll connect with her and see what she knows that we don't, all right?
I don't understand how we're gonna do this.
Even if we have all of the right names, what can we do to talk anyone into voting "no"?
I've got access to the President to offer.
You've got the purse strings of an important defense contractor.
And I will put a face on this registry and remind them of what really matters.
But first, we start with Felix Cordova.
Why would he help us?
He works for the enemy.
He's my friend.
I know him.
He'll play ball.
Looking for a better view of the foliage?
What do you think is waiting for us there?
Just a man who needs to answer a few questions.
That's all.
How do we know Vincent's even there?
Well, the land is in his name, power and water are running.
What if he doesn't talk?
This man is the only person who can point his finger at all the Collaborators.
He'll talk.
I'll make sure of it.
This seems easy for you.
I mean, I know you've taught this, but you haven't done anything like this in decades.
Well, that's why it's so easy.
I've spent 20 years with my wings clipped, not being allowed to be the man I knew I really was.
Now I can.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Big day.
You brought friends.
And you are...
Nimah Amin.
Would you like me to spell this for your little registry?
You're funny.
It's not funny to us.
And it shouldn't be to you, either.
There's no way the guy I know believes in singling out an entire religion as the bad guy.
I'm not in charge.
You're an immigrant.
How can you come to this country and then work to deprive other immigrants of their rights?
You live in a bubble.
Elites like you don't understand the concerns of everyday Americans.
Says the guy with a family crest.
I am an everyday American.
Hey, we know you're in a bind here, Felix.
Publicly, you have to support your boss, but secretly, maybe you're hoping this whole registry goes down in flames.
We can help make that happen.
All you have to do is give us the names of the swing votes you're targeting to win.
We will do the rest.
No one will ever know.
Stutz?
Cardenas?
Kreigsman?
Mullen?
Hassane?
Who are we missing?
Tell us.
I can't.
I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.
I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.
And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.
Let's move.
Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.
I'll wait for your funeral, you right-wing sellout.
Hands where I can see them.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
You're about to find out.
Hey.
What's the word?
Oh, not even a "hello"?
Clock's ticking.
My team needs to know what's happening with the vote.
Your names check out on my end, though you can take Mullen off the list.
Roarke finally okayed the money for a regional airport with his name on it.
Now even God couldn't change him to a "no."
Well, it's nice to see you in your element.
Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.
We'll get there.
Grab me when you know more, okay?
Did you know this was gonna happen?
Am I just an asset you're working?
Not "just," no.
But an asset, first and foremost.
Look, people like us... we help each other out when we need it.
Doesn't mean everything else doesn't matter.
No, I guess it doesn't.
- I got to go, okay?
- Mm-mh.
- When this is over with...
- The lift tickets are on you?
That's fair.
- Go.
- Okay.
Mullen's out.
That takes one name off the list, a name that we need.
If our math is right, we'll have to convince all of the remaining targets to vote "no."
What "Black Mirror" episode did we wake up in?
How can any American support the Muslim registry?
Most everyone I grew up with would.
My sorority sisters would.
Hell, once upon a time, I would have, too.
FBI work taught me better, but still, I understand.
You're apologizing for those people?
Those people are a part of this country.
If you ignore their voice, how can you expect them to hear yours?
Look, I'm not saying they're right.
I'm saying they have a right to their opinion.
Ah, the real America... two blond people arguing the merits of my freedom instead of letting me have it.
The fact that this is even happening is an atrocity.
We've learned nothing from history.
Turn those votes.
Ms. Wyatt, I'm not afraid to cross the aisle when it matters, but the nation is already reacting on both sides.
Pro- and anti-Muslim protests are already forming.
I can't afford to alienate my base.
You won't be if you give your district a big enough win on the employment front... say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant and a thousand jobs to go with it.
I have to worry about my job first.
I just can't take the risk.
My apologies.
I'm not just a Sikh or a woman.
I'm a red-state Democrat.
That's three strikes.
The last thing I can do at a time like this is vote my conscience over my constituents.
Well, you may not want your faith to define you, but this bill defines my people by theirs.
- How is that okay?
- I'm sorry.
I've made it too far to lose it all now.
Look, Congressman, you know me.
I briefed President Todd on the threats of Islamic terror.
I've personally had boots on the ground in these countries.
I know a dangerous policy when I see one.
- A list isn't dangerous.
- No, in and of itself, no, it's not, okay?
But when you create a list, you're also creating a recruitment tool.
It's making it easier for a kid to choose a life of suicide vests over anything else.
Believe me when I tell you this is making us more vulnerable, not less.
America is scared, and so am I.
They want action.
My vote is "yes," and I'm not sorry.
Why is it every time a Muslim kills someone in this country, he's a terrorist, but, you know, if a white man does it, he's simply disturbed?
Save that claptrap for your buddies in the lamestream media.
My vote's "yes," and it's rock-solid.
Your mother should know better than sending you in here like this.
It's embarrassing.
This is impossible.
No one's budging.
If these are the swing votes, we're screwed.
- What's the play?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
- I thought you were the speech writer...
- Hello?
...strategist of our generation.
Jon Favreau would know what to do.
Maybe we should call him.
You have a problem.
What's wrong?
FBI counterintelligence has Sasha Barinov flagged as a possible FSB asset.
She's not a Russian spy.
Well, my Capitol Police friend just heard back from the FBI after helping us with Sasha's credentials.
I thought you should know.
Sir, we've received a complaint and have been instructed to escort you out of the building.
Complaint?
From whom?
Felix.
He sent us after the wrong congressmen.
Did you have a nice field trip today?
It's nothing personal, just politics.
But I want to say thanks.
I had a lot of undecideds who hate your mother, and seeing you do her dirty work helped bring them home.
It won't even be a narrow margin now.
Sir, we have to go.
Come on.
Who do you work for?
You're gonna find out yourself the longer you keep me here.
Did you kill León Velez?
Frame Raina Amin?
That was you in Central Park.
You put Rebecca Sherman up to that?
That's a "yes."
You better stop asking questions and start answering them.
No.
You better get out of here.
I messed up.
They'll be coming for me.
They?
Who's they?
How'd you mess up?
The cops were supposed to find Amin's body in the mall.
She got away.
The people who hired me are gonna find me and kill me unless you let me grab my go-bag and we all get out of here.
You let me go and I will tell you everything... who I work for, who's next on their list.
Harry Doyle...
He's still alive!
Two shooters, maybe three.
- Who's out there?
Who hired you?
- Cut me loose and I'll tell you.
- Tell us now!
- Or what...
What do we do now?
Owen?
Owen, we need a plan!
I know.
Just...
let me think.
Owen, listen to me.
Break Tony's restraints.
Put your gun in his hand.
I'll cover you.
I got it.
How'd it go?
Did what I give you help?
- Oh, can't use it.
- Why not?
Well, because I don't know if I can trust you.
Why does the FBI have you flagged as a Russian asset?
- That's ridiculous.
- No, no, no.
You don't get on that list without a major paper trail to back it up.
They know something.
Who are you?
- Ryan, you're scaring me.
- You better start talking right now.
- I'm leaving.
- Are you working me?
Did you compromise me?
Who do you work for?
It's not what you think.
You're watching the House Session vote on bill S-322, the National Entry/Exit Registry System.
Bombónes?
My mother sends them every week.
No?
Okay.
Even if I wanted to stop this vote... and I don't... it's already happening.
We won.
You can get on the phone, beg, plead, lie.
They will listen to you because they'll think you disagree with Roarke.
Why would I do that?
Because there's more at stake than we can tell you... and because deep down, you know that singling out an entire faith is wrong.
Okay.
Okay, what if I tell you one of the chocolates in this bowl could kill you?
Would you play it safe?
Or would you take a chance and grab one?
These are people we're talking about, not cheap political props.
It wasn't my choice.
I hated Russia, what they do to their people.
I got out as soon as I could, but my parents are still there.
They're too poor to leave, too weak to protect themselves.
All I have to do is help the FSB with a little information from time to time and they stay safe.
That's all.
Did you tell them about me?
Of course not.
I would never.
Ryan, please, you have to believe me.
You grew up here... with real freedom, without fear.
You don't know what this is like.
I've seen firsthand what people will do to protect the ones that they love.
I know you're not lying.
I know who you are.
Mr. Cordova...
Felix.
You're from Madrid, right?
Your father is the ambassador to the United States.
So?
You lived in Madrid in '04.
What are you still doing here?
If memory serves, your sister... she died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.
Okay, this is not about my sister.
All hate comes from somewhere.
I do not hate, Ms. Amin.
I just know myself what terrorism can do if it's not eradicated.
So do I!
So do I.
It can spur violence against innocent men and women, destroy families, stoke imaginary fears against the other.
It's already too late.
S-322 passes by six votes.
It's out of our hands and into the President's now.
The president will veto it.
That's what I told Roarke.
He said he doesn't care.
Of course.
That's what this is about.
This is about keeping America safe...
Shut up.
Excuse me.
- We have to leave right now.
- Why?
They identified the bomber.
I know what you're gonna say.
We're safe now.
- Doesn't matter.
- I got in my head and you didn't.
I got grounded years ago because of a simple mistake.
I always told myself it was a fluke, could have happened to anybody, but it didn't.
It happened to me... because I screwed up.
And I've spent all the years since then landlocked on the Farm, safe from discovering what we both learned today... that I don't have what it takes when it comes down to it.
That is not true.
I'm not the man I wish I was.
Where are we?
Where are we?
We failed.
Raina Amin's been framed, a bill to create a Muslim registry is sitting on the President's desk waiting to be signed, and the worst part is, we never stood a chance to stop it.
This has always been about Claire, always has been.
She's what the Collaborators want.
I mean, this... this isn't about religious freedom or... or liberty.
It's about forcing the last person standing in their way to veto this bill, which they know that she will.
Whatever happens next will be perceived as her fault.
I should have seen this coming.
These people planted the seeds for this for months, years.
I mean, they're playing chess, and we can't even find the board.
Where are you going?
I have to call the President.
- What's this?
- Our room.
- I'm not living with you.
- You have no choice.
As far as the world's concerned, you're guilty of that bombing.
If you leave the Farm now, you're as good as done.
At least here I can keep you safe.
I'm trapped... again.
And again, it's because of you, Nimah.
If I leave now,
I'm gonna have to pay for a crime that I did not commit.
And if I stay here, I'll be in prison anyway.
What if I turn myself in?
For a bombing they said I did?
Just until this team proves you're innocent.
I'll be you in custody, and you'll be me, free in the world, helping fix it.
You would really do this for me?
You just said you're in this situation because of me.
Let me take the hard part.
- Nimah, you can't...
- Please... let me fix this.
Going somewhere?
Are you in trouble?
I could ask you the same question.
My asset didn't get flagged by the CIA as a Russian spy.
Well, Sasha hasn't been accused of any crime.
She doesn't have to be.
She's compromised, Ryan.
You have to drop her.
- What?
What?
Say it.
- Well, no, Sa...
No, Sasha's compromised because she's on some list somewhere?
The same way that your little backpacking buddy from India,
Amir Salaam, was on a list?
Does that make him compromised?
Does your association with him make you compromised?
You're putting all of us at risk.
Look, I'm not your soldier, Alex.
I'm not your asset, and I'm not your fiancé.
You think Sasha's trouble?
Okay.
I'll be careful.
The rest is up to me.
And with this veto,
President Haas sends a clear message to the American people.
"You're on your own."
Now, the rich are safe in their mansions and their gated communities, but common, everyday Americans are left to fend for themselves, unsure of when the next jihadist will strike.
And when they do...
and they will, mark my words... it will be on that woman's shoulders.
And when that happens, you ask her...
That wasn't just rhetoric.
Roarke's laying out his game plan.
Sooner or later, the Collaborators will stage another attack, and when they do, your mother will be done.
Her V.P. nominee has languished in the Senate for weeks now.
It's not hard to see why.
If she resigns... when she resigns... we all know who's next in succession.
The Speaker of the House...
Henry Roarke.
A Collaborator as President.
They'll have it all.
I know that veto hurts Claire in the short term, but it was the right thing.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You tried to talk her into signing it.
She didn't listen.
Wow.
I am disappointed.
Days like this... they show you what you're really made of.
Now I know.
So do you.
I know that Congress is willing and able to work with this President to help Americans, but she needs to be willing to work with us, the majority Americans elected to protect them... to protect their interests.
We will not back down.
You're right.
I should have a plaque made.
Someone took my booth.
Something happen?
More than what's already happened?
No.
- Just some friendly fire.
- Ryan.
- How'd you...
- I can see it on your face.
I might think twice out in the field, but I've been reading people in the classroom since the Clinton years.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Wow.
Look at us, smiling after almost being killed today.
Here.
And toasting while Rome is burning.
To our own cleverness, instead of being honest with ourselves.
Alex, I froze today.
I thought too much.
- No, don't.
- My instinct...
No.
My instinct is gone.
Now, you...
I mean, you have...
you have doubts.
We've been over that.
But you act first.
If I'm gonna make it out of here alive,
I need to learn to do the same.
And I think maybe you're the one to teach me.
Me help you?
That's...
What a smart man does who knows his limits... asks for the help he knows he needs.
So... help me.
Help me trust myself again.
Help me be... who I was... instead of who I am right now.
The finest Pinot grigio that your local supermarket sells.
Mm.
Funny.
I pegged you as more of an Old World red kind of guy.
I don't even know what that means.
Is the FBI right behind you?
Well, if they are, they're after me, not you.
I'm trusting you, until you give me a reason not to.
Trusting is a very stupid and dangerous habit, and yet I keep doing it.
You put your neck on the line to protect the people you love.
You shouldn't have to pay for that.
You gonna open that or what?
Caleb, it's Shelby.
I know you probably don't want to hear this, but I think your family needs you right now.
Proud of yourself?
No.
But my boss and my father are.
I'm sorry, Clay.
It isn't personal.
Yeah, that's the problem with your side.
It never is, and it should be.
I know what he's doing.
You didn't have a chance to win this.
When I find something you can, I will let you know.
Remember... always to the right.
I won't let them know we switched.
You will get me out of there as soon as you can, right?

"If you make a pass, never harass."
That is not a thing.
Did you even take the class?
Please.
I taught the class.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
No, he actually got up in front of the room.
The instructor lost her voice and asked for volunteers.
Was she hot?
Case closed.
McGEE:
All right, we are almost done with these in-service training reports.
Almost?
Uh, we just did six classes in three days.
Yeah, because our senior field agent screwed the pooch.
Look, I'm sorry; human resources used to keep track of all the scheduling.
It's not my fault that they changed the system and made it my responsibility.
So, we're pretty much saving your job.
Well, point is, we're getting caught up.

And we won't have to face any penalties.

Nope.
No buts.
We still have to do the O-CAT.

What is that, like, animal safety?
No, it's pepper spray training.

We got a body?
In Rock Creek Park.
(camera clicking)
BISHOP:
Gunnery Sergeant Remi Tanner.
We've seen a lot in this park, but this marble thing... that's a first.
Crushed by an ancient temple?
DUCKY:
Well, that is technically correct, Alex.
While not religious in nature and certainly not ancient, these stones were once part of a temple built to honor democracy:
the United States Capitol.
In 1958, the East Portico was remodeled and the leftover stones stacked here.
BISHOP:
Hmm.
This far off the beaten path?
I've never heard of this place.
DUCKY:
It's a forgotten legacy.
Ah, but these stones witnessed the inauguration of every president from, oh, Andrew Jackson to Dwight D. Eisenhower.
They also witnessed the final moments of our Marine's life.
Killed by a little piece of history.
DUCKY:
Yes, but look here.
Yeah, this man put up quite a fight before being crushed by government waste.
DAWSON:
If there was a fight,
Jasper heard it first.
That's the only reason I stopped to listen.
We trust each other's instincts.
(pats Jasper)
TORRES:
Does that include finding dead bodies?
DAWSON:
For everything.
Trust makes mounted police work possible.
They're flight animals.
They run when they're scared.
How does that work in the big city?
Well, it doesn't.
Right.
We train them to follow their riders.
It could take years.
But a mounted officer can do more than ten on foot.
From crowd control to P.R.
People are more willing to approach someone on a horse.
How does the horse feel about that?
(Dawson chuckles) Well, they're social animals.
TORRES:
Damn, Gibbs.
Seems like opposites attract, huh?
(chuckles) You bring treats, Agent Gibbs?
TORRES:
What's in your pocket?
Just leftover breakfast, but it's not vegetarian, Jasper.
I am sorry about that.
(chuckles) Thanks, Dawson.
Come on, Jasper.
Let's go.
Well, now we know that horses don't like jacket jerky.
(horse neighs) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay.
Jody only attacks criminals.
Yeah, I always knew the ladies always loved the bad boys.
Uh, actually, Jody's male.
He's named after one of our fallen park police officers.
What are you doing, checking?
(laughs) No, I'm just not a horse person, okay?
COLE:
That's all right.
They're not horses.
They're cops.
Okay, what do we have?
Well, there's footprints around the body.
McGEE:
Untraceable, but it shows there was two attackers.
Found a cell phone case, but no phone, and $500 cash in the victim's wallet.
Mugging interrupted by Mister Ed?
Well, it was late and the park was closed.
Exactly, so what was our Marine doing here in the first place?
DAWSON:
Agent Gibbs, over here!
Let's widen the search area.
Sorry, I thought Jasper was nosing after some crab apples, until I saw this burlap stuck in here.
Looks like blood, so I thought it might be evidence.
Let's see.
(grunts)
DAWSON:
Animal skulls.
What the hell?
BISHOP:
The lesser spot-nosed monkey, native to West African forests.
(laughs) Now, that's a cute animal.
BISHOP:
They were the source of the skulls found at the crime scene.
Not so cute.
Our victim, Gunnery Sergeant Tanner, was single and had a spotless record.
He was part of Marine Corps Forces Africa.
Just spent three months in Liberia, where his unit was sent to train wildlife rangers.
BISHOP:
I've heard of that.
U.S. Marines teach non-lethal raid tactics-- flash-bangs, rubber bullets.
Apprehending poachers is dangerous business.
BISHOP:
Well, these monkeys aren't endangered, but they're part of the illegal animal trade and sold as pets.
Not dead ones.
Why the skulls?
Maybe they're a message.
Revenge for Marine involvement in Africa?
Well, that still doesn't explain why the guy was in the park with a wallet full of cash.
Maybe the skulls were his.
What?
Why?
McGEE:
Skulls are valuable.
There's an entire American subculture obsessed with bone collecting.
How do you know that?
He dated Abby.
Ah.
I'm not saying the guy killed the monkeys himself, but maybe he brought home some souvenirs to sell.
And then things went bad.
Phone records night of the murder.
Uh, victim's missing cell phone has since been turned off or destroyed, but the last three calls were from the same person:
Phoebe Spitz.
Pick her up.
Well, Abby says
Miss Spitz is already on her way in.
Abby?
McGEE:
Yeah, apparently, she and Miss Spitz are friends;
they spoke this morning.
About what, skulls?
I have no idea, boss.
Abby said she'll explain later.
Tim, got your message and picked up those pepper sprays.
I'll have everybody sprayed and done by the week's end.
You're a lifesaver, Clayton.
Thank you.
Wait.
What's happening?
He put Reeves in charge?
Why?
Well, McGee claims that as British MI6, Clayton is an independent party.
Oh, I'm not giving either one of them the pleasure.
Look, we'll spray each other.
Huh?
You trust me.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I had to update my presentation.
What presentation?
Veterans Animal Patrol United.
It's an organization of U.S. military veterans who are dedicated to protecting wildlife around the world.
Oh, cool.
That's what I said.
So then I joined the board of directors last year and I met the founder, Miss Phoebe Spitz.
Doesn't she look awesome?
I love the camo.
Abby, I hate that picture.
I know, but it gets everybody's attention.
The photo helps with awareness, but it doesn't exactly capture our values.
You mean like death from above?
Peaceful conservation.
When I retired from the Marine Corps,
I made it my life's work.
I was trying to make it Tanner's, too.
I called last night to recruit him.
Three times?
Tanner kept hanging up on me.
I thought it was a bad connection.
Then Abby told me what happened.
It's horrible.
He was a good guy.
Was he an animal lover, as well?
Not at first, you know.
When Tanner's unit was first stationed in Liberia, he thought it was some kind of hippie-dippie P.R. stunt.
But then he was able to witness these animals in their natural habitat.
He was amazed to find out that elephants mourn their dead and rhinos dance before they mate.
Just like humans.
PHOEBE:
He was also amazed at how easy it is for poachers to kill these animals for their skins and ivory.
That was done with a chainsaw.
Oh, that's awful.
So, did he tell you why he was in Rock Creek Park last night?
Yeah, with monkey skulls?
No.
Our conversations were short.
He's been playing hard to get.
Is it possible maybe he was trying to sell them, the skulls?
No way.
Tanner may not have committed to my organization, but he was committed to these animals.
I thought you said this was about revenge.
Well, I... possibly, if we knew who might have a reason.
Oh, I-I do.
Here.
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, arrested last month.
So, he's in prison?
Yes, and Tanner's unit put him there.
Look, Best has a network of smugglers all around the world.
I wouldn't put it past him to put out some kind of bounty.
Did Tanner tell you that last night?
No.
Like I told you,
I have no idea what was going on in that park.
(horse neighs)
(trash can lids banging)
That's it.
Good boy.
TORRES:
All right.
Thank you.
MAN:
Whoa, whoa.
(horse neighs)
Bishop and McGee went to the victim's apartment.
All they found was his laptop.
(horse snorting)
I'm assuming this only makes sense to horse people?
Police horses have to train.
Pushing the ball teaches them to push a crowd, and the banging gets them used to city sounds.
You off duty?
Yeah, but I usually stick around to help train the horses.
And I heard you wanted to talk about recent park activity.
Yeah, crime patterns.
Anything new?
Unusual?
Like animal trafficking?
It's looking that way.
Disgusting.
Can't say we find a lot of tusks and furs laying around, but I would gladly sift through crime reports if it helps catch them.
Yeah, great.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
Horses are not dogs, man.
You don't miss a thing.
No, I'm saying, cats and dogs I understand, but anything bigger than a person,
I mean, it's just not a pet.
That's right.
They're livestock.
COLE (over radio):
This is Officer Cole.
Hold me out at Bingham Road and Fern Trail.
Suspicious activity.
One suspect in custody.
That's near your crime scene.
Backup en route.
You drive, I'll point the way.
Cole, copy.
NELSON:
Um, I think they left.
Who the hell are you?
Under arrest, I think.
One minute this officer busts me for smoking a joint, the next he handcuffs me to this bench and takes off on his horse.
Why?
I'm pretty sure they were chasing someone, but I am kind of high.
(gunfire in distance)
Shots fired, shots fired.
Stay here with him.
DAWSON:
Backup required at Fern Trail.
Cole.
Cole.
Oh, my God.
Officer down, officer down.
We need immediate medical assistance at Bingham and Fern.
Whoa, boy.
(neighing)
Whoa, Jody.
Whoa.
DISPATCHER:
Dispatching EMT to Bingham and Fern.
(neighing continues)
Okay, all right, Cole.
I'm gonna apply some pressure.
This may hurt.
Gibbs, grab his bridal.
Hold on, Cole.
Whoa, whoa, Jody, whoa.
Help is coming.
You're gonna be okay.
(neighs softly)
Uh, Dawson.
Yeah?
Call the vet, too.
It's okay.
Easy, now.
I appreciate the update.
Okay.
Officer Cole is at Washington General with two chest wounds.
Doctors have their hands full.
(sighs)
Any word on the horse?
Yeah, he's being treated at the stable.
I don't understand how you guys are so emotional over a horse.
"A," I grew up on a farm and horses are beautiful animals.
And "B", these tears are the end of pepper spray.
Boom.
(chuckles)
Wait, you guys let Reeves do it?
Hell no.
(sniffles)
I was merely a witness to a whole new universe of foul language.
Oh, yeah.
Quinn has a potty mouth.
REEVES:
No, it was Ellie who raised the bar to Olympic heights.
QUINN:
Ah.
Even I blushed.
Well, I know six languages.
It's easy to get creative.
REEVES:
Thank you.
The international desk keeps getting calls from the Liberian embassy.
The ambassador wants to meet with Director Vance.
Uh, what for?
They haven't given me a reason.
Just keeps telling me it's urgent.
Huh.
Well, what happened at the park?
Well, Gibbs is talking to the only guy who might be able to tell us something.
NELSON:
Well, I was kind of high.
Things are a bit blurry.
Yeah, like your criminal record.
Nelson, you were arrested six years ago for airport drug trafficking.
You did prison time.
I've changed now.
So, what were you doing near a murder scene?
Murder?
Whoa.
Now, I mean, yes, I had pot, but that's legal in D.C.
And you'll find that bag weighs exactly 1.9 ounces, so you can't arrest me.
Unless we can prove intent to sell.
Even if I was selling-- and that's not an admission-- I'm not getting rich.
When I got out of prison, I downsized.
Ever hear of minimalism?
I cut my dreadlocks and got rid of everything I own.
I only buy what I need to live.
I don't even have a bank account.
You can check.
We did.
Where were you last night?
I was alone all night in my tiny house.
I park it all over.
My carbon footprint is very low.
Aside from smoking like a chimney.
That's the only reason I got busted.
McGEE:
You lit up in a public place.
It's against the law.
Apparently, horses can smell prime Kush for miles;
they caught me.
And left you.
Oh, yeah.
As he was writing me a ticket, the horse heard someone in the bushes.
It stopped and got real quiet.
He.
Horse is a he.
Okay.
He seemed to recognize a scent or something and got fidgety.
So, the officer cuffed me to the bench and let the horse lead the way.
Then you guys showed up and the gunshots started.
Did you see the person?
All I saw was a shadow.
It happened real fast.
That horse was like a Scud missile.
A stud missile.
(laughing)
Director Vance,
Liberian Ambassador Gabriel Moore.
Ambassador Moore, it's a pleasure.
You are dismissed.
Ambassador, would you like to sit...
Director Vance, my country was in the news this morning, and the only reason I found out was because I was watching.
Why was my embassy not first informed?
The news reported the murder of a decorated Marine.
Who was working with my government in Gola National Forest.
Training wildlife rangers, yes, but he was killed here in D.C.
Ambassador, forgive me, but your embassy was not very clear as to the nature of this meeting.
You have information to help our case?
I do not.
Then I'm confused.
About what?
About why you're angry with NCIS.
The victim was found with animal skulls, huh?
That was not reported in the news.
You will keep me informed before anything is made public.
Well...
I report to the Secretary of the Navy, but as a courtesy,
I'll be happy to keep you in the loop.
I will keep you updated.
It is my duty to make sure my country and its people are fairly represented on the world stage.
What exactly are you expecting?
I won't take up any more of your time.
Director.
Agent Gibbs.
Dawson.
How you holding up?
Cole just got out of surgery, so it's... touch and go.
But the doctors thought it went better than expected.
I know him, he's strong.
He'll make it through.
Which is why he's gonna need those riding boots back as soon as you finish processing them.
I also have Jody's tack out in my truck.
This is a joint investigation now, right?
Have a seat.
I prefer an outdoor office.
I meant to say nice work with Jody.
You didn't tell me you were a horse guy.
Yeah, that makes two of us.
Something about you standing next to a horse, that does seem symmetrical.
Jody seemed to think so, too.
That horse doesn't usually take so easily to strangers.
Was just following orders.
Oh, I have this.
The vet found this in Jody's mouth.
Hey, Quinn.
What is that?
It looks like bone or ivory.
(phone ringing)
Did the horse eat anything at the crime scene?
That's why I thought it would help.
GIBBS:
Abbs, yeah.
I'm on the way down.
Right now.
Dawson, you waiting for an invitation?
Well, the park is my office.
This is yours.
Joint investigation.
Come on, let's go.
(elevator bell dings)
Marine gunny's car.
It was found parked in a lot outside Rock Creek Park.
So, he entered on foot.
Dawson, park police.
Abby, science police.
Anything tell you why he entered the park?
I'm still working on it, but this parking stub was found underneath one of the windshield wiper blades.
It's dated the night that he died, but there's no address, so still trying to track down where that came from.
That why you called?
Nope.
Then what do you got?
Evidence of a genocide.
Animal or human?
Insect.
The southern pine beetle.
DAWSON:
Tree killer.
Yep.
That's why the Forest Service sprays infested areas with a poison called permethrin.
Guess what else had traces of permethrin on it.
How?
So glad you asked.
So the only local area that's recently been dusted is a remote stretch of land outside of Alexandria.
That's a national forest.
The bag was there?
Mm-hmm.
Two days ago, when it was sprayed.
The only structure in the spray zone is an old ranger shack.
Thanks, Abbs.
DAWSON:
Did you try carrots?
What about his treats?
Well, then I'm out of ideas, but I'll visit tomorrow.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Jody.
Bullet wound?
Just a graze, no tissue damage.
The horse could gallop tomorrow, but Jody won't eat.
Well, he's used to the same person, riding him, feeding him, putting him away.
He knows something's wrong.
So you know your horses.
Got tire tracks.
Looks like a dually.
(camera clicks)
Box truck, maybe.
So you know your trucks.
I own trucks.
Got them and the horses in the divorce.
He got everything else.
What else is there?
His 23-year-old assistant.
You got the better part of that deal.
Damn right, I don't have to have dinner with the horses' sorority sisters.
That's a new lock.
DAWSON:
About as secure as a screen door on a submarine.
Whoa.
Whatever's inside might need to stay in there.
(clears throat)
Only one thing smells like that.
Dead body.
I was hoping for something different this time.
Mind if I get this over with?
(flies buzzing)
Well, that's different.
It's called bushmeat.
Derived from animals native to Africa.
Bat, monkey, lion-- whatever the local population hunts for protein.
In Liberia.
Oh, in many countries all over Africa.
It's outlawed by their governments because it destroys the ecosystems.
Duck, this case isn't about rhino horns or elephant tusks.
No, it's about food.
So what's it doing in the U.S.?
Jethro, illegal bushmeat is a worldwide, billion-dollar business.
It's smoked, smuggled into the country, and then sold on the street to expatriate communities.
Taste of home.
Well, never underestimate the power of nostalgia.
Mere pounds can go for hundreds of dollars.
It's a health risk.
Well, the greatest fear is of an unknown and catastrophic disease.
You see, smoking the meat does not kill off all the bacteria.
Sounds like nightmare soup.
It's a shame.
I used to like soup.
What do you have?
Uh, maybe a little good news.
That's a welcome change.
I know why our killer stole our victim's cell phone:
he was taking pictures of them.
But our dead Marine had a cloud account that automatically uploads any cell phone pictures.
No clear faces, but they tell a story.
The bushmeat must be in those bags.
Including the skulls.
Well, they're used to prove the meat's origin and worth.
BISHOP:
Either way,
I think these guys were headed to the park to sell it.
Our Marine followed them.
Mm-hmm.
He hid in the bushes, but they must have seen him and attacked.
When Dawson showed up, the killers ditched the monkey skulls.
They came back yesterday.
Which is when they shot Officer Cole and his horse.
But it is looking like our dead Marine was one of the good guys.
An animal lover to the last.
VANCE:
This is what you wouldn't say, what you thought this case was leading to.
My apologies, Director Vance.
It is both a source of great pride and embarrassment.
Have a seat.
We... are a nation of survivors.
Slavery, civil wars.
We strive for progress, but many are still poor, and cattle production is difficult and costly.
Bushmeat has been a way of life for generations.
Which is why it can wipe out animal populations.
It is unsustainable and a health risk.
My government desperately tries to teach this to the public.
But food is also a cultural touchstone.
Used for celebrations, weddings, christenings.
More reasons it's smuggled into our country.
Old habits die hard.
Sorry, that's another turn of phrase.
It's difficult to change minds.
Even more so to change hearts.
Ah.
Many Liberian citizens believe the government to be weak or corrupt.
Sometimes it is true.
But I am here to offer any assistance you may require.
Anything, please.
I appreciate that.
And I just might have something in mind.
Undercover?
Ambassador Moore has agreed to lead you through a local street market where he believes bushmeat is being sold.
Market vendors can lead us to the smugglers.
Yeah, and the killers, I get it.
Why did he ask for me?
Said he liked you.
He liked me?
The man said two things to me:
"Hello," and then "Get out of the room."
I'm pretty sure he thought I was the butler.
So did I at first.
Reeves, Jeeves.
So confusing.
That's funny.
I can also think of something that rhymes with "Nick."
- Slick?
- Try again.
Quinn, everything okay?
Uh, no, just got off the phone with the hospital.
It seems that Officer Cole's internal bleeding didn't stop, so he died an hour ago.
Looks like we've got two murders on our hands.
Boss, did you hear about this?
Find the source of that meat.
(elevator bell dings)
(elevator bell dings)
(upbeat African music playing, food sizzling)
(lively crowd chatter)
(bleating)
WOMAN:
Gentlemen, come, come.
You need spices?
I have spices.
Tsire has a lovely flavor.
Peanuts and spices, perfect for meat.
MOORE:
That is the problem.
We have no meat.
Perhaps you can help us?
This is a market.
There is plenty of meat.
You pick something.
I have spices to make it delicious.
MOORE:
Uh, no, no, no, no.
I want to cook my friend a piece of home.
Mm-hmm.
I need bushmeat.
What is the word you said?
Bushmeat, please.
This is America.
I am an American.
I don't know about that.
Now, go.
Go!
(sighs)
No one's willing to talk to us.
Patience.
The word will spread.
Someone always wants to make money, huh?
Is it odd this is making me hungry?
Everyone gets hungry.
Even butlers.
MAN:
Fresh veggies, gentlemen!
Come try some.
No, thanks.
One taste can change your mind.
You did say you were hungry.
Wait, I know you.
MOORE:
I...
I don't think so.
Yes, yes, yes,
You are a government man.
Please, keep your voice down, huh?
Oh, I will.
If the rich government man donates to the knife show.
Knife show?
You've got a long way before you turn pro.
I am flawless.
Hardly.
Look at your ear.
Practice makes perfect.
Yeah, clearly you need lots of it.
Hey, Clayton, pay the man and let it be, huh?
We do not want trouble.
WOMAN:
Let go of me!
She did not pay for that!
I saw you!
Who do you think you are?
You cannot come to our market and just think you can take...
All right, all right, break it up!
That's enough!
Break it up!
Hey, that's enough!
Or I start spraying!
Get off her!
I've recently seen how nasty this stuff is.
I really don't want to use it.
Okay?
So stop.
Please.
Who the hell are you?
She was stealing from us!
I can explain.
DAWSON:
Thanks for returning Cole's boots.
The familiar scent and visual can help them understand.
Help them...
grieve and move on.
Worth a shot.
I agree.
Question is: how did you know to bring the boots?
(chuckles)
I know that you'd want Cole's badge.
We're finished with processing.
Thank you.
(softly):
Yeah.
Really thought that he'd pull through.
You two were close.
Yeah, I trained him.
And right now I'm wondering if I did a good enough job.
This place, these people, they're family.
I think you did everything right.
Jody still won't eat.
Sounds funny, but you know, they get depressed.
Yeah, I've seen that before.
My daughter, Kelly, she used to ride down by the beach.
There was this stable near the water, owned by an old Korean War vet.
He started calling her Sergeant Reckless.
After the war horse, why?
One summer, his wife died, and her horse wouldn't ride, wouldn't eat.
Kelly noticed that, and she made it her project.
Horse ignored her.
But she kept going back.
Every day.
Until the horse started eating.
Mm-hmm.
She knew that that horse just needed a buddy.
Sergeant Reckless, because like the war horse, your daughter was a lifesaver.
(chuckles)
So horse sense runs in the family.
No.
Uh, that was all her.
I saw the way that you were with Jody yesterday.
You're just what he needs to break his funk.
Funk?
Everybody here has already tried everything;
this horse is as stubborn as they come, and I think he's finally met his match, Gibbs.
At least, I hope so, anyways, if you're willing.
A horse that doesn't eat, dies.
I was only trying to help.
Okay, last time I was here,
NCIS thought my friend was guilty, so I wanted to clear his name.
I was there, asking questions about bushmeat.
No one would answer me, so I started poking around.
They thought you were stealing.
Because they're hiding something.
I didn't find anything to prove that, but I can tell.
Wait a minute.
Who told you the murder had to do with bushmeat?
Abby.
Okay.
What else do we have?
Nothing.
We've hit a dead end.
No leads on the bushmeat or the smuggling pipeline.
(door opens, closes)
Okay, first thing.
I only talked to Phoebe because she knew the victim.
I didn't know she was gonna go commando.
What's the second thing?
Okay, the second thing should be the first thing.
I used the wildlife DNA database to track all the animals from the meat shack.
They all came from the Gbarma District of Liberia.
Is that good or bad?
It's a bad thing.
A small village in Gbarma just reported an Ebola outbreak.
All the meat downstairs was clear.
Next shipment won't be.
No.
We have to cut off this pipeline, now.
Okay, CDC, FDA and the FAA have all been notified.
FAA?
According to the USDA, bushmeat gets into the country via airports.
How many different agencies are involved with this stuff?
Well, I left out FWS, who said the meat can be hidden in shipments of fish or other legal foods.
But mostly, it's just smuggled in suitcases.
Well, you won't find that in the food court.
Point is, a shipment tainted with Ebola has its way of getting here.
We're gonna stop them.
McGEE:
Yeah, we're trying, boss.
We've been through all the Liberian Intel.
Government surveillance on poachers and known players in the animal trade.
McGEE:
A lot of suspects.
BISHOP:
But none in the U.S.
Dead end.
Whoa, wait.
Stop.
Go back.
Right there.
Who's that?
BISHOP:
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, but he's in prison in Liberia.
Who's that with him?
The dreadlock guy?
Uh, I can't tell.
You know what?
Our Marine has more photos from that same batch on his laptop.
Boss, is that...?
ABBY:
Nelson, our park stoner.
He said he quit trafficking illegal drugs, which was true.
Yeah, well, he got into bushmeat.
Different product, same illegal pipeline.
Airport connections.
Guy was broke.
If he's a kingpin, where's the money?
He was never a kingpin.
He was an avenue to get to U.S. soil.
He's getting the meat from someplace overseas, so I'm betting that that's where the money is, too.
It's an offshore account.
Yeah.
Still raises a lot of questions.
TORRES:
And I got answers.
And maracas.
(maracas shaking)
Ah!
They had them at the pawn shop.
TORRES:
Oh, you owe me $10.
Oh, Abby will explain.
Oh, I gave, uh, my maracas to a friend of mine.
No, uh, explain the other thing.
Right.
So, I finally tracked down the parking stub from the Marine's car to a parking garage by a pawn shop downtown.
Here.
I checked it out.
Tanner pawned a guitar the night he died.
Deposit for a new apartment.
Explains the cash in his wallet.
TORRES:
Also explains how he found Nelson.
Got security footage from the parking garage.
Can you fast forward to 9:47 p.m., please?
Yep.
And there's our stoner.
And Gunnery Sergeant Tanner walked right by him.
Yeah, he bumped into him in the parking lot.
Purely by chance.
GIBBS:
He recognized him.
ABBY:
Probably from the same photo you did, Gibbs.
Also, Tanner's been studying those poacher files for at least three months.
ABBY:
He must have followed Nelson all the way to the park.
Where is he now?
No permanent address.
He does live in a mobile tiny house.
What about his accomplice?
The guy who shot Officer Cole and the horse does not show up on the video.
But I might have a lead, and straight from the horse's mouth.
Someone had to say it.
McGEE:
So how much jewelry did you have to go through before you found a match?
A lot.
Ivory's still way too popular.
Uh, the piece from Jody's mouth was from a spiral taper earring.
Thought horses were vegetarians.
Well, they are, but this one was smart enough to take a bite out of the shooter.
REEVES:
Yeah.
His bloody ear wasn't from his knife act.
Oh, he's on the move.
Look.
GIBBS:
Heads up, gang.
We got a truck.
(horn honks)
McGee, you three have the street.
It's a busy place.
Not ideal for a takedown.
Wait on my signal.
Hurry up.
Come on, I called you two hours ago.
Between the park yesterday and the market today, police are too close.
Then forget your stuff so we can get the hell out of here.
If we can get out of the country, my uncle will hide us in Monrovia.
I don't need your uncle.
Let's go.
GIBBS:
Bishop, Torres, move.
Federal agents!
The police, they're here!
Then you better get out of the way.
McGEE:
Gun!
NCIS!
(coughing)
It's over!
Put your hands in the air!
(coughing)
Don't shoot!
(handcuffs clicking)
This is exactly how they train rangers to take down poachers.
NEWSCASTER:
Two arrests have been made in connection with the smuggling of illegal bushmeat into the United States.
Meat tainted with the Ebola virus...
Congratulations, Director.
Two smugglers gave up their airport contacts pretty fast.
Be assured, my government is following up in Liberia.
This will not end here.
Ball's in your court now.
That idiom I know.
(laughs)
Press conference is in an hour.
Director.
Please be mindful in your media portrayal of my government.
It is a powerful tool that could help build trust.
This press conference will be seen back home.
Which is why you're giving the opening statement.
I beg your pardon?
I can't think of anything more powerful than your country seeing a proud and committed public servant.
(laughs)
Thank you.
Now, that's just, um...
that's just beautiful.
Park police said he was born this morning and that they named him after fallen officer Cole.
Mm.
Cole the foal.
(chuckles) Just...
Who's crying over a horse now?
Oh, come on.
It's pepper spray, come on.
Nick, that was three hours ago.
(laughs)
McGEE:
Nick.
Got great news.
What's up, Tim?
Um...
You know what, never mind.
Come on, tell me.
What's up?
Okay, um...
(chuckles)
It's a, it's kind of a funny story, really.
The, uh, the OCAT training.
I just came from HR.
Turns out they, uh, they mixed up the dates.
We're not due until next year.
We didn't have to get sprayed?
Oops.
"Oops"?
Okay, Reeves, hand it over.
I'm sorry, Tim, but I am an independent party.
What?
What are you doing?
No.
Oh, come on.
That's funny.
Very funny, very funny.
Any last words before we take this outside?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on.
This-this is not my fault.
(rooster crowing)
DAWSON:
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
Good to have you back, pal.
What changed, huh?
Gibbs, you've been here all night?
What did you do?
What?
He's eating.
Tell me what you did.
I could get you a coffee or an aspirin.
That's a mighty hard floor.
No.
We don't mind.
Do we, Jody?
(chuckles)
He just needed a buddy.
Well, you know, Jody could also use a ride, if you're up for it.
What do you think?
(laughs) Okay.
♪ ♪
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Let me guess.
Fun?
You like this place so much, you just had to tell the world.
I get it.
I like it here, too.
This is Sergeant Dawson calling in vandalism on Pine Trail.
Suspect fleeing north on foot.
Copy that, Sergeant.
Told you, Jasper.
This place is fun.
Give it up, kid, before you get hurt!
Jasper, what's wrong?
Easy, boy.
Easy.
Whoa, buddy.
What's up?
Good ear, Jasper.
We better check that out.
Park police!
Anybody out here?
This is Dawson.
Hold me out at East Portico Stones.
Got a possible disturbance.
Copy that, Dawson.
State the nature of the disturbance.
Whoa.
Steady.
Sergeant Dawson, do you require assistance?
Dawson, do you copy?
Sergeant Dawson, do you need backup?
Sergeant?
First aid.
Report writing.
And sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment training, really?
Did you even learn anything?
If you make a pass, never harass.
That is not a thing.
Did you even take the class?
Please.
I taught the class.
Right.
Yeah.
No, he actually got up in front of the room.
The instructor lost her voice and asked for volunteers.
Was she hot?
Case closed.
All right, we are almost done with these in-service training reports.
Almost?
We just did six classes in three days.
Yeah, because our senior field agent screwed the pooch.
Look, I'm sorry;
Human resources used to keep track of all the scheduling.
It's not my fault that they changed the system and made it my responsibility.
So, we're pretty much saving your job.
Well, point is, we're getting caught up.
And?
And we won't have to face any penalties.
And?
And thank you for saving my job.
Seriously.
But...
Nope.
No buts.
We still have to do the O-CAT.
What is that, like, animal safety?
No, it's pepper spray training.
Every couple years, we all have to get recertified.
Yeah, which includes getting sprayed.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'll go easy on you guys.
No, no.
No, this is your fault.
No, you don't get to spray on us.
Who else is gonna do it?
You want help?
We're okay.
No way.
What?
Suit yourself.
Grab your gear.
We got a body?
In Rock Creek Park.
Gunnery Sergeant Remi Tanner.
We've seen a lot in this park, but this marble thing... that's a first.
Crushed by an ancient temple?
Well, that is technically correct, Alex.
While not religious in nature and certainly not ancient, these stones were once part of a temple built to honor democracy:
The United States Capitol.
In 1958, the East Portico was remodeled and the leftover stones stacked here.
This far off the beaten path?
I've never heard of this place.
It's a forgotten legacy.
But these stones witnessed the inauguration of every president from, Andrew Jackson to Dwight D. Eisenhower.
They also witnessed the final moments of our Marine's life.
Killed by a little piece of history.
Yes, but look here.
Yeah, this man put up quite a fight before being crushed by government waste.
If there was a fight,
Jasper heard it first.
That's the only reason I stopped to listen.
We trust each other's instincts.
Does that include finding dead bodies?
For everything.
Trust makes mounted police work possible.
They're flight animals.
They run when they're scared.
How does that work in the big city?
Well, it doesn't.
Right.
We train them to follow their riders.
It could take years.
But a mounted officer can do more than ten on foot.
From crowd control to P.R.
People are more willing to approach someone on a horse.
How does the horse feel about that?
Well, they're social animals.
Damn, Gibbs.
Seems like opposites attract?
You bring treats, Agent Gibbs?
What's in your pocket?
Just leftover breakfast, but it's not vegetarian, Jasper.
I am sorry about that.
Thanks, Dawson.
Come on, Jasper.
Let's go.
Well, now we know that horses don't like jacket jerky.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay.
Jody only attacks criminals.
Yeah, I always knew the ladies always loved the bad boys.
Actually, Jody's male.
He's named after one of our fallen park police officers.
What are you doing, checking?
No, I'm just not a horse person, okay?
That's all right.
They're not horses.
They're cops.
Okay, what do we have?
Well, there's footprints around the body.
Untraceable, but it shows there was two attackers.
Found a cell phone case, but no phone, and $500 cash in the victim's wallet.
Mugging interrupted by Mister Ed?
Well, it was late and the park was closed.
Exactly, so what was our Marine doing here in the first place?
Agent Gibbs, over here!
Let's widen the search area.
Sorry, I thought Jasper was nosing after some crab apples, until I saw this burlap stuck in here.
Looks like blood, so I thought it might be evidence.
Let's see.
Animal skulls.
What the hell?
The lesser spot-nosed monkey, native to West African forests.
Now, that's a cute animal.
They were the source of the skulls found at the crime scene.
Not so cute.
Our victim, Gunnery Sergeant Tanner, was single and had a spotless record.
He was part of Marine Corps Forces Africa.
Just spent three months in Liberia, where his unit was sent to train wildlife rangers.
I've heard of that.
U.S. Marines teach non-lethal raid tactics...
Flash-bangs, rubber bullets.
Apprehending poachers is dangerous business.
Well, these monkeys aren't endangered, but they're part of the illegal animal trade and sold as pets.
Not dead ones.
Why the skulls?
Maybe they're a message.
Revenge for Marine involvement in Africa?
Well, that still doesn't explain why the guy was in the park with a wallet full of cash.
Maybe the skulls were his.
What?
Why?
Skulls are valuable.
There's an entire American subculture obsessed with bone collecting.
How do you know that?
He dated Abby.
I'm not saying the guy killed the monkeys himself, but maybe he brought home some souvenirs to sell.
And then things went bad.
Phone records night of the murder.
Victim's missing cell phone has since been turned off or destroyed, but the last three calls were from the same person:
Phoebe Spitz.
Pick her up.
Well, Abby says.
Miss Spitz is already on her way in.
Abby?
Yeah, apparently, she and Miss Spitz are friends;
They spoke this morning.
About what, skulls?
I have no idea, boss.
Abby said she'll explain later.
Tim, got your message and picked up those pepper sprays.
I'll have everybody sprayed and done by the week's end.
You're a lifesaver, Clayton.
Thank you.
Wait.
What's happening?
He put Reeves in charge?
Why?
Well, McGee claims that as British MI6, Clayton is an independent party.
I'm not giving either one of them the pleasure.
Look, we'll spray each other.
You trust me.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I had to update my presentation.
What presentation?
Veterans Animal Patrol United.
It's an organization of U.S. military veterans who are dedicated to protecting wildlife around the world.
Cool.
That's what I said.
So then I joined the board of directors last year and I met the founder, Miss Phoebe Spitz.
Doesn't she look awesome?
I love the camo.
Abby, I hate that picture.
I know, but it gets everybody's attention.
The photo helps with awareness, but it doesn't exactly capture our values.
You mean like death from above?
Peaceful conservation.
When I retired from the Marine Corps,
I made it my life's work.
I was trying to make it Tanner's, too.
I called last night to recruit him.
Three times?
Tanner kept hanging up on me.
I thought it was a bad connection.
Then Abby told me what happened.
It's horrible.
He was a good guy.
Was he an animal lover, as well?
Not at first, you know.
When Tanner's unit was first stationed in Liberia, he thought it was some kind of hippie-dippie P.R. stunt.
But then he was able to witness these animals in their natural habitat.
He was amazed to find out that elephants mourn their dead and rhinos dance before they mate.
Just like humans.
He was also amazed at how easy it is for poachers to kill these animals for their skins and ivory.
That was done with a chainsaw.
That's awful.
So, did he tell you why he was in Rock Creek Park last night?
Yeah, with monkey skulls?
No.
Our conversations were short.
He's been playing hard to get.
Is it possible maybe he was trying to sell them, the skulls?
No way.
Tanner may not have committed to my organization, but he was committed to these animals.
I thought you said this was about revenge.
Well, I... possibly, if we knew who might have a reason.
I-I do.
Here.
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, arrested last month.
So, he's in prison?
Yes, and Tanner's unit put him there.
Look, Best has a network of smugglers all around the world.
I wouldn't put it past him to put out some kind of bounty.
Did Tanner tell you that last night?
No.
Like I told you,
I have no idea what was going on in that park.
That's it.
Good boy.
All right.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa.
Bishop and McGee went to the victim's apartment.
All they found was his laptop.
I'm assuming this only makes sense to horse people?
Police horses have to train.
Pushing the ball teaches them to push a crowd, and the banging gets them used to city sounds.
You off duty?
Yeah, but I usually stick around to help train the horses.
And I heard you wanted to talk about recent park activity.
Yeah, crime patterns.
Anything new?
Unusual?
Like animal trafficking?
It's looking that way.
Disgusting.
Can't say we find a lot of tusks and furs laying around, but I would gladly sift through crime reports if it helps catch them.
Yeah, great.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
Horses are not dogs, man.
You don't miss a thing.
No, I'm saying, cats and dogs I understand, but anything bigger than a person,
I mean, it's just not a pet.
That's right.
They're livestock.
This is Officer Cole.
Hold me out at Bingham Road and Fern Trail.
Suspicious activity.
One suspect in custody.
That's near your crime scene.
Backup en route.
You drive, I'll point the way.
Cole, copy.
Um, I think they left.
Who the hell are you?
Under arrest, I think.
One minute this officer busts me for smoking a joint, the next he handcuffs me to this bench and takes off on his horse.
Why?
I'm pretty sure they were chasing someone, but I am kind of high.
Shots fired, shots fired.
Stay here with him.
Backup required at Fern Trail.
Cole.
Cole.
My God.
Officer down, officer down.
We need immediate medical assistance at Bingham and Fern.
Whoa, boy.
Whoa, Jody.
Whoa.
Dispatching EMT to Bingham and Fern.
Okay, all right, Cole.
I'm gonna apply some pressure.
This may hurt.
Gibbs, grab his bridal.
Hold on, Cole.
Whoa, whoa, Jody, whoa.
Help is coming.
You're gonna be okay.
Dawson.
Yeah?
Call the vet, too.
It's okay.
Easy, now.
I appreciate the update.
Okay.
Officer Cole is at Washington General with two chest wounds.
Doctors have their hands full.
Any word on the horse?
Yeah, he's being treated at the stable.
I don't understand how you guys are so emotional over a horse.
A, I grew up on a farm and horses are beautiful animals.
And B, these tears are the end of pepper spray.
Boom.
Wait, you guys let Reeves do it?
Hell no.
I was merely a witness to a whole new universe of foul language.
Yeah.
Quinn has a potty mouth.
No, it was Ellie who raised the bar to Olympic heights.
Even I blushed.
Well, I know six languages.
It's easy to get creative.
Thank you.
The international desk keeps getting calls from the Liberian embassy.
The ambassador wants to meet with Director Vance.
What for?
They haven't given me a reason.
Just keeps telling me it's urgent.
Well, what happened at the park?
Well, Gibbs is talking to the only guy who might be able to tell us something.
Well, I was kind of high.
Things are a bit blurry.
Yeah, like your criminal record.
Nelson, you were arrested six years ago for airport drug trafficking.
You did prison time.
I've changed now.
So, what were you doing near a murder scene?
Murder?
Whoa.
Now, I mean, yes, I had pot, but that's legal in D.C.
And you'll find that bag weighs exactly 1.9 ounces, so you can't arrest me.
Unless we can prove intent to sell.
Even if I was selling...
And that's not an admission...
I'm not getting rich.
When I got out of prison, I downsized.
Ever hear of minimalism?
I cut my dreadlocks and got rid of everything I own.
I only buy what I need to live.
I don't even have a bank account.
You can check.
We did.
Where were you last night?
I was alone all night in my tiny house.
I park it all over.
My carbon footprint is very low.
Aside from smoking like a chimney.
That's the only reason I got busted.
You lit up in a public place.
It's against the law.
Apparently, horses can smell prime Kush for miles;
They caught me.
And left you.
Yeah.
As he was writing me a ticket, the horse heard someone in the bushes.
It stopped and got real quiet.
He.
Horse is a he.
Okay.
He seemed to recognize a scent or something and got fidgety.
So, the officer cuffed me to the bench and let the horse lead the way.
Then you guys showed up and the gunshots started.
Did you see the person?
All I saw was a shadow.
It happened real fast.
That horse was like a Scud missile.
A stud missile.
Director Vance,
Liberian Ambassador Gabriel Moore.
Ambassador Moore, it's a pleasure.
You are dismissed.
Ambassador, would you like to sit...
Director Vance, my country was in the news this morning, and the only reason I found out was because I was watching.
Why was my embassy not first informed?
The news reported the murder of a decorated Marine.
Who was working with my government in Gola National Forest.
Training wildlife rangers, yes, but he was killed here in D.C.
Ambassador, forgive me, but your embassy was not very clear as to the nature of this meeting.
You have information to help our case?
I do not.
Then I'm confused.
About what?
About why you're angry with NCIS.
The victim was found with animal skulls?
That was not reported in the news.
You will keep me informed before anything is made public.
Well...
I report to the Secretary of the Navy, but as a courtesy,
I'll be happy to keep you in the loop.
I will keep you updated.
It is my duty to make sure my country and its people are fairly represented on the world stage.
What exactly are you expecting?
I won't take up any more of your time.
Director.
Agent Gibbs.
Dawson.
How you holding up?
Cole just got out of surgery, so it's... touch and go.
But the doctors thought it went better than expected.
I know him, he's strong.
He'll make it through.
Which is why he's gonna need those riding boots back as soon as you finish processing them.
I also have Jody's tack out in my truck.
This is a joint investigation now, right?
Have a seat.
I prefer an outdoor office.
I meant to say nice work with Jody.
You didn't tell me you were a horse guy.
Yeah, that makes two of us.
Something about you standing next to a horse, that does seem symmetrical.
Jody seemed to think so, too.
That horse doesn't usually take so easily to strangers.
Was just following orders.
I have this.
The vet found this in Jody's mouth.
Hey, Quinn.
What is that?
It looks like bone or ivory.
Did the horse eat anything at the crime scene?
That's why I thought it would help.
Abbs, yeah.
I'm on the way down.
Right now.
Dawson, you waiting for an invitation?
Well, the park is my office.
This is yours.
Joint investigation.
Come on, let's go.
Marine gunny's car.
It was found parked in a lot outside Rock Creek Park.
So, he entered on foot.
Dawson, park police.
Abby, science police.
Anything tell you why he entered the park?
I'm still working on it, but this parking stub was found underneath one of the windshield wiper blades.
It's dated the night that he died, but there's no address, so still trying to track down where that came from.
That why you called?
Nope.
Then what do you got?
Evidence of a genocide.
Animal or human?
Insect.
The southern pine beetle.
Tree killer.
Yep.
That's why the Forest Service sprays infested areas with a poison called permethrin.
Guess what else had traces of permethrin on it.
How?
So glad you asked.
So the only local area that's recently been dusted is a remote stretch of land outside of Alexandria.
That's a national forest.
The bag was there?
Two days ago, when it was sprayed.
The only structure in the spray zone is an old ranger shack.
Thanks, Abbs.
Did you try carrots?
What about his treats?
Well, then I'm out of ideas, but I'll visit tomorrow.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Jody.
Bullet wound?
Just a graze, no tissue damage.
The horse could gallop tomorrow, but Jody won't eat.
Well, he's used to the same person, riding him, feeding him, putting him away.
He knows something's wrong.
So you know your horses.
Got tire tracks.
Looks like a dually.
Box truck, maybe.
So you know your trucks.
I own trucks.
Got them and the horses in the divorce.
He got everything else.
What else is there?
His 23-year-old assistant.
You got the better part of that deal.
Damn right, I don't have to have dinner with the horses' sorority sisters.
That's a new lock.
About as secure as a screen door on a submarine.
Whoa.
Whatever's inside might need to stay in there.
Only one thing smells like that.
Dead body.
I was hoping for something different this time.
Mind if I get this over with?
Well, that's different.
It's called bushmeat.
Derived from animals native to Africa.
Bat, monkey, lion...
Whatever the local population hunts for protein.
In Liberia.
In many countries all over Africa.
It's outlawed by their governments because it destroys the ecosystems.
Duck, this case isn't about rhino horns or elephant tusks.
No, it's about food.
So what's it doing in the U.S.?
Jethro, illegal bushmeat is a worldwide, billion-dollar business.
It's smoked, smuggled into the country, and then sold on the street to expatriate communities.
Taste of home.
Well, never underestimate the power of nostalgia.
Mere pounds can go for hundreds of dollars.
It's a health risk.
Well, the greatest fear is of an unknown and catastrophic disease.
You see, smoking the meat does not kill off all the bacteria.
Sounds like nightmare soup.
It's a shame.
I used to like soup.
What do you have?
Maybe a little good news.
That's a welcome change.
I know why our killer stole our victim's cell phone:
He was taking pictures of them.
But our dead Marine had a cloud account that automatically uploads any cell phone pictures.
No clear faces, but they tell a story.
The bushmeat must be in those bags.
Including the skulls.
Well, they're used to prove the meat's origin and worth.
Either way,
I think these guys were headed to the park to sell it.
Our Marine followed them.
He hid in the bushes, but they must have seen him and attacked.
When Dawson showed up, the killers ditched the monkey skulls.
They came back yesterday.
Which is when they shot Officer Cole and his horse.
But it is looking like our dead Marine was one of the good guys.
An animal lover to the last.
This is what you wouldn't say, what you thought this case was leading to.
My apologies, Director Vance.
It is both a source of great pride and embarrassment.
Have a seat.
We... are a nation of survivors.
Slavery, civil wars.
We strive for progress, but many are still poor, and cattle production is difficult and costly.
Bushmeat has been a way of life for generations.
Which is why it can wipe out animal populations.
It is unsustainable and a health risk.
My government desperately tries to teach this to the public.
But food is also a cultural touchstone.
Used for celebrations, weddings, christenings.
More reasons it's smuggled into our country.
Old habits die hard.
Sorry, that's another turn of phrase.
It's difficult to change minds.
Even more so to change hearts.
Many Liberian citizens believe the government to be weak or corrupt.
Sometimes it is true.
But I am here to offer any assistance you may require.
Anything, please.
I appreciate that.
And I just might have something in mind.
Undercover?
Ambassador Moore has agreed to lead you through a local street market where he believes bushmeat is being sold.
Market vendors can lead us to the smugglers.
Yeah, and the killers, I get it.
Why did he ask for me?
Said he liked you.
He liked me?
The man said two things to me:
Hello, and then Get out of the room.
I'm pretty sure he thought I was the butler.
So did I at first.
Reeves, Jeeves.
So confusing.
That's funny.
I can also think of something that rhymes with Nick.
- Slick?
- Try again.
Quinn, everything okay?
No, just got off the phone with the hospital.
It seems that Officer Cole's internal bleeding didn't stop, so he died an hour ago.
Looks like we've got two murders on our hands.
Boss, did you hear about this?
Find the source of that meat.
Gentlemen, come, come.
You need spices?
I have spices.
Tsire has a lovely flavor.
Peanuts and spices, perfect for meat.
That is the problem.
We have no meat.
Perhaps you can help us?
This is a market.
There is plenty of meat.
You pick something.
I have spices to make it delicious.
No, no, no, no.
I want to cook my friend a piece of home.
I need bushmeat.
What is the word you said?
Bushmeat, please.
This is America.
I am an American.
I don't know about that.
Now, go.
Go!
No one's willing to talk to us.
Patience.
The word will spread.
Someone always wants to make money?
Is it odd this is making me hungry?
Everyone gets hungry.
Even butlers.
Fresh veggies, gentlemen!
Come try some.
No, thanks.
One taste can change your mind.
You did say you were hungry.
- Wait, I know you.
- I...
I don't think so.
Yes, yes, yes,
You are a government man.
Please, keep your voice down?
I will.
If the rich government man donates to the knife show.
Knife show?
You've got a long way before you turn pro.
I am flawless.
Hardly.
Look at your ear.
Practice makes perfect.
Yeah, clearly you need lots of it.
Hey, Clayton, pay the man and let it be?
We do not want trouble.
Let go of me!
She did not pay for that!
I saw you!
Who do you think you are?
You cannot come to our market and just think you can take...
All right, all right, break it up!
That's enough!
Break it up!
Hey, that's enough!
Or I start spraying!
Get off her!
I've recently seen how nasty this stuff is.
I really don't want to use it.
Okay?
So stop.
Please.
Who the hell are you?
She was stealing from us!
I can explain.
Thanks for returning Cole's boots.
The familiar scent and visual can help them understand.
Help them... grieve and move on.
Worth a shot.
I agree.
How did you know to bring the boots?
I know that you'd want Cole's badge.
We're finished with processing.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Really thought that he'd pull through.
You two were close.
Yeah, I trained him.
And right now I'm wondering if I did a good enough job.
This place, these people, they're family.
I think you did everything right.
Jody still won't eat.
Sounds funny, but you know, they get depressed.
Yeah, I've seen that before.
My daughter, Kelly, she used to ride down by the beach.
There was this stable near the water, owned by an old Korean War vet.
He started calling her Sergeant Reckless.
After the war horse, why?
One summer, his wife died, and her horse wouldn't ride, wouldn't eat.
Kelly noticed that, and she made it her project.
Horse ignored her.
But she kept going back.
Every day.
Until the horse started eating.
She knew that that horse just needed a buddy.
Sergeant Reckless, because like the war horse, your daughter was a lifesaver.
So horse sense runs in the family.
No.
That was all her.
I saw the way that you were with Jody yesterday.
You're just what he needs to break his funk.
Funk?
Everybody here has already tried everything;
This horse is as stubborn as they come, and I think he's finally met his match, Gibbs.
At least, I hope so, anyways, if you're willing.
A horse that doesn't eat, dies.
I was only trying to help.
Okay, last time I was here,
NCIS thought my friend was guilty, so I wanted to clear his name.
I was there, asking questions about bushmeat.
No one would answer me, so I started poking around.
They thought you were stealing.
Because they're hiding something.
I didn't find anything to prove that, but I can tell.
Wait a minute.
Who told you the murder had to do with bushmeat?
Abby.
Okay.
What else do we have?
Nothing.
We've hit a dead end.
No leads on the bushmeat or the smuggling pipeline.
Okay, first thing.
I only talked to Phoebe because she knew the victim.
I didn't know she was gonna go commando.
What's the second thing?
Okay, the second thing should be the first thing.
I used the wildlife DNA database to track all the animals from the meat shack.
They all came from the Gbarma District of Liberia.
Is that good or bad?
It's a bad thing.
A small village in Gbarma just reported an Ebola outbreak.
All the meat downstairs was clear.
Next shipment won't be.
No.
We have to cut off this pipeline, now.
Okay, CDC, FDA and the FAA have all been notified.
According to the USDA, bushmeat gets into the country via airports.
How many different agencies are involved with this stuff?
Well, I left out FWS, who said the meat can be hidden in shipments of fish or other legal foods.
But mostly, it's just smuggled in suitcases.
Well, you won't find that in the food court.
Point is, a shipment tainted with Ebola has its way of getting here.
We're gonna stop them.
Yeah, we're trying, boss.
We've been through all the Liberian Intel.
Government surveillance on poachers and known players in the animal trade.
A lot of suspects.
But none in the U.S.
Dead end.
Whoa, wait.
Stop.
Go back.
Right there.
Who's that?
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, but he's in prison in Liberia.
Who's that with him?
The dreadlock guy?
I can't tell.
You know what?
Our Marine has more photos from that same batch on his laptop.
Boss, is that...?
Nelson, our park stoner.
He said he quit trafficking illegal drugs, which was true.
Yeah, well, he got into bushmeat.
Different product, same illegal pipeline.
Airport connections.
Guy was broke.
If he's a kingpin, where's the money?
He was never a kingpin.
He was an avenue to get to U.S. soil.
He's getting the meat from someplace overseas, so I'm betting that that's where the money is, too.
It's an offshore account.
Yeah.
Still raises a lot of questions.
And I got answers.
And maracas.
They had them at the pawn shop.
You owe me $10.
Abby will explain.
I gave, my maracas to a friend of mine.
No, explain the other thing.
Right.
So, I finally tracked down the parking stub from the Marine's car to a parking garage by a pawn shop downtown.
Here.
I checked it out.
Tanner pawned a guitar the night he died.
Deposit for a new apartment.
Explains the cash in his wallet.
Also explains how he found Nelson.
Got security footage from the parking garage.
Can you fast forward to 9:47 p.m., please?
Yep.
And there's our stoner.
And Gunnery Sergeant Tanner walked right by him.
Yeah, he bumped into him in the parking lot.
Purely by chance.
He recognized him.
Probably from the same photo you did, Gibbs.
Also, Tanner's been studying those poacher files for at least three months.
He must have followed Nelson all the way to the park.
Where is he now?
No permanent address.
He does live in a mobile tiny house.
What about his accomplice?
The guy who shot Officer Cole and the horse does not show up on the video.
But I might have a lead, and straight from the horse's mouth.
Someone had to say it.
So how much jewelry did you have to go through before you found a match?
A lot.
Ivory's still way too popular.
The piece from Jody's mouth was from a spiral taper earring.
Thought horses were vegetarians.
Well, they are, but this one was smart enough to take a bite out of the shooter.
Yeah.
His bloody ear wasn't from his knife act.
He's on the move.
Look.
Heads up, gang.
We got a truck.
McGee, you three have the street.
It's a busy place.
Not ideal for a takedown.
Wait on my signal.
Hurry up.
Come on, I called you two hours ago.
Between the park yesterday and the market today, police are too close.
Then forget your stuff so we can get the hell out of here.
If we can get out of the country, my uncle will hide us in Monrovia.
I don't need your uncle.
Let's go.
Bishop, Torres, move.
Federal agents!
The police, they're here!
Then you better get out of the way.
Gun!
It's over!
Put your hands in the air!
Don't shoot!
This is exactly how they train rangers to take down poachers.
Two arrests have been made in connection with the smuggling of illegal bushmeat into the United States.
Meat tainted with the Ebola virus...
Congratulations, Director.
Two smugglers gave up their airport contacts pretty fast.
Be assured, my government is following up in Liberia.
This will not end here.
Ball's in your court now.
That idiom I know.
Press conference is in an hour.
Director.
Please be mindful in your media portrayal of my government.
It is a powerful tool that could help build trust.
This press conference will be seen back home.
Which is why you're giving the opening statement.
I beg your pardon?
I can't think of anything more powerful than your country seeing a proud and committed public servant.
Thank you.
Now, that's just, um...
that's just beautiful.
Park police said he was born this morning and that they named him after fallen officer Cole.
Cole the foal.
Just...
Who's crying over a horse now?
Come on.
It's pepper spray, come on.
Nick, that was three hours ago.
Nick.
Got great news.
What's up, Tim?
Um...
You know what, never mind.
Come on, tell me.
What's up?
Okay, um...
It's a, it's kind of a funny story, really.
The, the OCAT training.
I just came from HR.
Turns out they, they mixed up the dates.
We're not due until next year.
We didn't have to get sprayed?
Oops.
Oops?
Okay, Reeves, hand it over.
I'm sorry, Tim, but I am an independent party.
What?
What are you doing?
No.
Come on.
That's funny.
Very funny, very funny.
Any last words before we take this outside?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on.
This-this is not my fault.
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
Good to have you back, pal.
What changed?
Gibbs, you've been here all night?
What did you do?
What?
He's eating.
Tell me what you did.
I could get you a coffee or an aspirin.
That's a mighty hard floor.
No.
We don't mind.
Do we, Jody?
He just needed a buddy.
Well, you know, Jody could also use a ride, if you're up for it.
What do you think?
Okay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Navy Coalition Fight Night here in beautiful New Orleans.
Navy versus Marines!
Oh... oh!
Yeah!
One, two, three.
That's it, it's over, it's over.
And the winner, by a knockout,
Navy Petty Officer Johnny Rudd!
Chaplain Morgan.
Hey, hey, hey, stay down.
You're gonna be okay.
You'll be okay, all right?
Oh, my God.
Someone call 911!
Come on.
An ambulance... 911.
Come on.
Johnny...
You're gonna be okay.
You're right...
Trust in the Word.
What?
No, no, no, no, no.
Wow.
Peanut butter crackers, jelly beans, vanilla crèmes.
It's the best we could do from the vending machine in the waiting room.
How you holding up, Percy?
Eh, I'm good.
I've been needing a break.
Didn't realize all I needed to do was be held in contempt, and voilà... nothing but me time.
Not ready to laugh this one off just yet.
Still upset?
You know I'm not happy you let Nadine Bancroft go.
She's a fugitive now, but I'm not gonna let you rot in jail.
The judge is making a point of keeping me here.
He's not letting me out anytime soon.
Unless you change your statement.
Give Nadine up.
That's all the judge wants.
Well, we all know that's not gonna happen.
Well, it wouldn't matter much at this point.
Judge Dorsey doesn't care about the Bancroft case.
He was put up to this stunt by Hamilton, as a message to me.
Wiretapping the mayor's phone backfired.
I've been making calls.
Every favor I pull, Hamilton pulls two more.
But don't worry.
I'm not done fighting yet.
Excuse me.
What do you got?
The way he said "don't worry"
kind of makes me worry.
He's been eating himself up about your situation
I'm responsible for my situation.
Neither of you should worry.
I mean, it's not like I'm in gen pop.
Segregated holding is nothing more than daytime TV and canned pasta.
Orange just might be your color.
Christopher, we got work.
Sonja, hang in there.
Paul, you're Chief of Corrections.
Your opinion's got to mean something in this mess.
No, I hear you...
I appreciate that you're trying.
Yeah, talk soon.
He can't help?
Already tried.
Put in a word with Justice, but..
Mayor Hamilton shut him down.
Ooh, my ears.
My ears are burning.
Were you boys just talking about me?
What are you doing at my crime scene?
Well, I'm a bystander.
I was just giving my statement.
Uh, I had nothing to do with the murder here.
You got any questions, you can call my office.
It'll save you the hassle of trying to wiretap me again.
By the way, how's Agent Percy doing?
Huh?
You were in the jail tonight, right.
That's why you're late, hmm?
I tell you, Dwayne, you look like you really want to take a swing at me.
Well, why don't you, then?
Go ahead, huh?
And you can join Agent Percy in lockup.
Go ahead.
You don't want to.
Who are you?
That's, uh, my new security consultant,
Mr. Stone.
These are dangerous times, man.
Dangerous times.
You want to come at me?
Come at me.
Don't be a coward.
My team's off-limits.
Nothing's off-limits, man.
No.
You're smart enough to know that.
Come on, King, now's not the time.
Mm-mm-mm.
Tell me things.
Uh, victim is Commander Henry Morgan, navy chaplain out of Belle Chase.
Judging by the stab wounds in the lower abdomen, severe blood loss, I'd say cause of death was multiple organ failure.
And murder weapon was a tactical knife.
Morgan still had it in him when he came into the ballroom.
He was attacked off-site?
Yeah, blood trail comes in from around the corner,
- lake side of the hangar.
- He was tough, though.
Multiple fractures of the metacarpal bones in both hands.
He fought back.
Chaplain was stabbed outside, manages to make his way inside, looking for help.
From someone specific, too.
Witnesses say that he headed for a Petty Officer Jonathan Rudd, one of the fighters tonight.
You question him?
Not yet.
He's upstairs.
Lasalle and I will go talk to Petty Officer Rudd.
Seems like it was a little tense over there with Mayor Hamilton.
It's fine.
No, I've got eyes, Dwayne.
It was anything but fine.
Loretta...
I'm good.
Chaplain Morgan was trying to reach you.
What'd he say before he died?
"Trust in the Word."
That's all.
Trust in the Word?
Anything bad, whatever happened, he would just look at you sort of matter-of-fact and tell you to trust in the Word.
You knew him well?
He was the pastor at Clearwater Baptist.
You're from Clearwater?
Chaplain was your pastor.
He was more than that.
He was like a father.
And not just to me.
I'm guessing he taught you how to fight.
In the ring, with honor.
Saved my life.
I joined the navy 'cause of him.
So he was a chaplain at the naval base, and a pastor at Clearwater Baptist?
Well, Clearwater was important to him.
He felt responsible for the community.
And it got him killed.
What do you mean?
He was supposed to be here tonight, in my corner, but he didn't show.
I got a call a half hour before the fight.
He wasn't making a lot of sense.
Said that he needed help, and that there was a new threat.
We're in danger.
You and him?
Clearwater.
King...
It's Hamilton.
Mayor Hamilton's responsible for the chaplain being killed?
"A new threat in Clearwater."
That's what Rudd said.
He did, but...
Hamilton removed police services weeks ago.
Set up a slush fund to buy up properties.
Forced people out who wouldn't sell.
Okay, I hear you.
I know it, Christopher, in my bones...
What would you tell me if the roles were reversed here?
You'd say work the case.
See where it leads.
So let's go work the case.
Talk to me.
Asked us to pull everything we got on the Clearwater investigation.
We don't have much.
We know Audubon Industries has been buying up properties there.
We know it's a shell corporation with a fat off-shore bank account.
Funded with drug money from a narcotics ring we busted last month.
And we're pretty sure Mayor Hamilton's behind it all, but we don't have any evidence.
It's there, you just have to find it.
I'm wondering what any of this has to do with Chaplain Morgan's killing.
Pride thinks it's connected.
Morgan was a community leader.
Worked to keep Clearwater intact.
The mayor's working to destroy it.
Morgan found a new danger in the neighborhood.
Bit of a reach, don't you think?
No, I don't.
Where are we with Morgan's murder?
No witnesses.
Area where the guy was stabbed outside is a blind spot for security cameras.
Perfect place for an ambush.
Killer knew what he was doing.
And the weapon?
A combat knife, drop point blade.
Serrated edge.
Too common to trace back to a point of sale, and no DNA or prints, except for the victim's.
So nothing.
Well, I'm...
I mean, I found some trace amounts of fiberglass along the bolster and the thumbstud.
I'm still working on a more detailed analysis.
Well, we got to dig deeper, people.
Get into Chaplain Morgan's life.
Figure out any connection to Hamilton or Audubon...
What if there isn't one?
I've been monitoring 911 dispatch to Clearwater since NOPD resources were pulled.
Call just came in outside of Clearwater Baptist.
Shots fired.
That's Morgan's church.
Chris, Gregorio, with me.
Somebody tore this place apart.
Somebody's getting torn apart.
Rudd!
, Rudd, back off!
Rudd!
Hey.
Get this guy off me.
- Stand down now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pride, he killed him.
He killed Chaplain Morgan!
You killed him!
Keep moving.
I told you to let us investigate this case...
NCIS.
I wasn't investigating anything.
I came in and he was here.
Who is he?
Carlton Boone.
Gang leader.
Heads up the Public Enemies.
Public Enemies are Lower Nine.
They don't run in Clearwater.
They do now.
Ever since the cops abandoned the neighborhood.
Public Enemies, Ward Warriors.
And what makes you so sure Boone killed Chaplain Morgan?
Some of the parishioners said they saw them arguing yesterday morning.
Right in front of the church.
That is not exactly a smoking gun.
Look at this place.
Boone wrecked the church?
Why?
Chaplain Morgan was the only person standing between the neighborhood and the gangs.
He stood up to them.
Mostly, they respected the pulpit.
You should've come to me with this.
I came in here to set up for a memorial.
I see Boone standing in the middle of the sanctuary, like he's proud of the mess he made.
What was I supposed to do?
You weren't supposed to beat a suspect within an inch of his life.
I only wish you would've came a few moments later,
I would've finished the job.
And then what?
You'd be up on a murder charge.
Jeopardizing my case, your navy career...
Come on, Rudd.
I've known you all of ten minutes, you're no killer.
If you push a man far enough...
That what Chaplain Morgan taught you?
Eye for an eye?
"Trust in the Word." Right?
That's what he used to tell you.
Then honor him.
Get ahold of yourself.
Anger'll just tear you apart.
This community needs people to hold them together.
Let us deal with Boone.
We know you got in an argument with Chaplain Morgan the morning he died.
And whatever it was, you got so worked up that you went and wrecked his church.
That wasn't me.
Look, I-I went down there to light a candle in his memory.
That place was a hurricane when I got there.
What about the argument, Carlton?
Morgan was a pain in the ass, okay?
He stuck his nose where it didn't belong.
Trying to broker peace between the Public Enemies and the Ward Warriors.
You weren't interested in peace.
No.
But it was important to the pastor.
And he showed respect.
And we showed it back.
But one day, someone stopped showing it.
Couple weeks ago, one of my boys disappeared.
So, wait.
You thinking the Warriors broke their truce and took one of your guys out?
Yeah.
Morgan had a different idea, said someone else was responsible.
Another gang.
No, not a gang.
A new player, looking to take down the whole neighborhood.
Look, I thought the pastor was just trying to stall me, but now he's dead.
So maybe he was right.
New player in Clearwater, it's Hamilton.
All we know is that he's probably buying up properties.
She's right.
We need more to connect Hamilton to Morgan's death.
Sebastian processed the church.
I'll see what he came up with.
I'll come with you.
No.
Follow up on Boone's story.
See if it holds water.
It's like he's willing there to be a connection to Hamilton.
Yeah, can't blame him.
Mayor goes after one of our own, it's hard not to take it personal.
He's not the only one.
What's that supposed to mean?
You and Percy are close.
She's inside, you're out, can't be easy.
It's not easy for any of us.
Percy's our family.
I'm no more or less worried for her than you.
All right.
This is me, minding my own business.
Gregorio, for real, I'm good.
All right?
Percy's in a safe place, and we'll be getting her out soon.
Yeah.
You're right.
So, uh, mind telling me where we're going?
Got you a new cell.
Something wrong with the old one?
Afraid that's above my pay grade.
Hey, what section of the jail are you taking me to?
C-Block.
C-Block?
That's general population.
Affirmative.
Well, look, there's a mistake, all right?
I'm a federal agent.
A cop.
There's, like, a dozen people I personally put in there.
Listen, I don't take orders from prisoners.
Now you're walking through that door, voluntarily or by force.
Here's what we know.
Chaplain Morgan was afraid of a new threat to Clearwater, warned Rudd about it before he was murdered.
And you think that threat is Mayor Hamilton.
I do.
But I still need proof.
Okay.
All right, you're looking right at me.
So that's, that's a little bit of pressure.
Oh, I don't think Dwayne is putting pressure on anyone, he just wants to know what evidence you found in the church, no matter who that might point to.
Okay.
Well, great, then.
Um, I can tell you this for sure:
uh, the church wasn't vandalized so much as it was tossed.
Whoever wrecked the place was looking for something specific.
Any idea what?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was this.
HD camera, shotgun mic, parabolic sound amplifier, all top of the line, all night vision enabled.
I found it in the chaplain's office.
Surveillance equipment.
I don't think Morgan was recording the choir with it.
What was he recording?
Not sure.
The data card's gone, hard drive's busted,
I can't recover anything.
So, whoever tossed the church probably has the data card.
Means whatever's on it was worth killing for.
Well, we might not be able to tell you what was on the data card, but we may be able to tell you where the suspect can be found.
While performing the chaplain's autopsy,
I found foreign substance in his lungs.
There's traces of microscopic fiberglass.
It matches the trace we found on the murder weapon.
Which means Morgan and his killer were at another location before the murder.
- Where?
- New Orleans Heritage Boat Yard used to be one of Clearwater's primary employers.
Lot of fiberglass was used here before the financial crisis hit.
Heritage went bankrupt, been shuttered ever since, until the property was purchased end of last year by Audubon Industries.
So we know Chaplain Morgan was here, his killer was.
Which means you were right, Pride.
This murder is connected to Mayor Hamilton.
Still don't know how.
Got fresh tire tracks right here.
Chance our answer's inside.
All right.
Stay sharp.
Federal agent.
Put the canister down slow.
And then let me see those hands.
Easy.
Let me see them!
- Pride!
Pride!
- Pride!
Enough!
He's down.
BOLO's out on the SUV the suspects fled in.
We took the windshield out, so they can't get far.
They're dumping that vehicle first chance they get.
Whatever they were doing, they cleaned up.
Place is covered in bleach, crew was thorough.
Not your typical street thugs.
The way they fight, the way they shoot, every tactic, they're pros.
You thinking ex-military?
Why would Hamilton bring private contractors into Clearwater?
Well, whatever the reason, Chaplain Morgan found out, and they killed him before he could tell anyone else.
How can you be sure?
The guy I fought had a broken nose.
Courtesy of Morgan's boxing days.
Yeah.
We almost had them.
We got to be faster next time.
Speed's not the problem, King.
Fact is, I think you moved a little too fast back there.
Trying to take the suspect down without us.
It almost got yourself killed.
Think I was reckless?
Yeah.
You could've waited a moment for backup.
I'm tired of always being a step behind Hamilton.
We need a win.
And we will get it.
Together.
Sebastian's on his way.
Anything the suspects left behind, he'll find it.
Won't have to.
I already have it.
Got the killer's blood right here.
Ha.
Match the DNA, we got his identity.
NCIS got to the boatyard before we could bug out.
Had to engage.
So you thought the next obvious move was setting up a meeting with me in broad daylight, huh?
No one followed me.
I was careful.
Nothing you've done is careful.
You killed a navy chaplain in front of half of official New Orleans.
Clean up your mess, finish your assignment.
We're on a schedule here.
Oh, and, uh, please stop bleeding on my leather.
I gave your guys a lot of money because you told me they were the best.
All evidence to the contrary.
You said you'd handle NCIS.
They're onto Audubon, which means it's only a matter of time before they link it to you.
Audubon will not be a problem.
It already is.
Yeah, yeah.
I-I've got that covered.
You do your job, I'll do mine.
State police just found the suspects' stolen SUV, ditched off the 57 in Dulac, charred to the frame.
Last night, these guys killed the chaplain, took the data card from his camera and then cleaned up whatever they were doing at that boatyard.
Probably on their way out of town.
I'll head over to Dulac now to check on the SUV, just in case.
You have a collect call from an inmate at Orleans Parish Prison.
Would you like to accept?
Yes.
Hey, jailbird?
Shouldn't you be watching daytime TV?
I'm in trouble, Lasalle.
What's going on?
They moved me to gen pop.
What?
When?
This morning.
They wouldn't let me use the phone until just now.
It's no secret that I'm a fed.
There're people here who want to do me some serious harm.
Yeah, and somebody pulled some strings to get you locked up right there with 'em.
Yeah, I'm screwed.
We're gonna get you out of there, Percy.
I promise.
It's got to be soon.
I'm on borrowed time.
We're gonna do everything we can.
And I need you to get yourself safe until we do.
You listening?
Yeah.
Do whatever it takes to get yourself safe, Percy.
Anything.
Get her up!
Put her in the hole.
Now!
Let's go.
All right, Chris.
But ju...
Let me know as soon as you find out anything new.
You know I will.
Damn it.
Hamilton had Sonja transferred to general population.
Is Sonja all right?
She jumped a guard.
Got herself... put into solitary.
She's safe for now.
Okay.
Then please sit back down.
I'm not done taking samples.
I need to go.
Break Sonja out?
I'm going to City Hall.
Ah, to give Hamilton a piece of your mind.
How did that that work out for you in the past?
Dwayne, you want to help Sonja?
If you want to stop Hamilton, then let's identify
Chaplain Morgan's killer.
Please sit down.
Lasalle and Gregorio think I'm being reckless.
I'm guessing you agree?
You carry the weight of the city on your shoulders.
It's not uncommon to stumble from time to time.
Hamilton's threatening the safety of my team.
'Cause we're getting close to him.
But I swear, I...
I've got everything under con...
Control.
Dwayne.
This situation hasn't been under control for a long time.
Sonja isn't the first casualty.
Rita just barely survived being run off the road.
This isn't about Rita.
It's about you losing sight of who you are.
What you do.
How can you take care of your team...
Or yourself...
If you're blinded by rage?
Is that more news of Sonja?
No.
It's about the case.
I need to go, if...
Yes.
Go.
From the moment
I left the base this afternoon, these guys were on my six.
Gray van.
Tinted windows.
They were following you?
More than that.
I get to Clearwater, they get aggressive.
Cut me off.
They tried to ambush me.
I got out of the car and ran.
Did you see what they looked like?
Military fit.
And fast.
Slipped into an old cargo depot by the river.
Just barely lost 'em in the maze of containers.
Came here.
Did the right thing.
Morgan caught those guys on camera doing something wrong and they killed him.
They stole the camera's data card.
Why come after me if they have what they want?
Because I'm pretty sure that they don't.
I just did some digital surgery on Morgan's busted camera.
I learned that the data card was ejected an hour before he died.
Means it's possible his killers still don't have it.
- And they think I do.
- They must, if they're willing to go after you in broad daylight, knowing we're on their tails.
Well, it only confirms that whatever's on the card is highly sensitive.
I have no idea where this card is.
Hate to crash your party, but Triple P is about to serve you up a sizzling hot lead.
Gregorio, stick with Petty Officer Rudd here.
See if you two can't figure out where that data card might be.
What do you got, P?
Sebastian was running some of the blood samples we got off of your knuckles.
And none of the national DNA databases had a match.
Which is when he tagged me in.
I may have access to some restricted international databases.
That's our guy.
- He's the chaplain's killer.
- Ansel Warshak.
Former Israeli Special Forces and former Mossad.
And now he's a freelance operative.
Any idea who's paying him?
Oh, this is the best part.
Audubon Industries.
Okay.
So Warshak had two associates.
We need their names and their locations.
Can you do that?
Oh, ask and you shall receive.
Patton Plame.
I'm going to need you to take your hands off that keyboard.
What's going on, Karen?
We have reason to believe that your computer specialist has been involved in committing federal cybercrime.
Mr. Plame, surrender your tablet or I will place you under arrest.
Hey, yo, easy with my hardware, man.
This is some expensive equipment.
Mr. Plame, go into the other room.
Don't interfere with our investigation.
Just comply with her, Patton.
All right?
I'll sort this out.
Don't give me "the look," Dwayne.
I'm just doing my job here.
We have hard evidence to suggest that Mr. Plame was involved in an online horse racing scam last year.
And that evidence pertains to an undercover sting operation that my team executed to take down Javier Garcia.
Official NCIS business.
Official NCIS business leaves a paper trail, Dwayne.
Tag the servers.
Take them, too.
How'd you find out?
Excuse me?
You're right.
There is no paper trail on our sting operation.
The target is dead.
So how'd you find out?
Confidential informant.
We both know it's Hamilton.
He helped with the sting.
He's just using you to try and...
and chip away at me, and you're letting him.
This isn't personal.
The hell it isn't.
Mr. Plame, my agent is gonna escort you off the premises.
You are to refrain from all contact with NCIS and any other federal agencies.
Furthermore, you're forbidden to use any Web-connected digital device until our investigation is complete.
Do you understand?
How's it feel to be the mayor's damn errand girl?
You did not just say that.
First you put Sonja behind bars.
Now Patton?
Percy put herself behind bars.
I don't have a choice, Dwayne...
Yes, you do.
You're just making the wrong one.
I'm the Assistant U.S. Attorney.
I have a boss to answer to.
Don't want to arrest you for obstruction, but I will if I have to.
Pride...
It's cool, man.
I'm going.
You got a case to solve.
Hey.
I'll make this right.
Just keep to the terms.
No computers till I get this figured.
Whatever you say, man.
I have a very unusual heat in my stomach.
I-It's not, uh, food poisoning.
It's not gas.
It's... it's harder, you know?
You want to break somebody's face.
I really do, yeah.
We can't let Hamilton keep getting away with this crap.
We won't, Christopher.
You ready to go to war with the mayor, we got your back.
I know you do.
But we...
We'll need our wits to get this done.
Look, I spent a lot of time telling Petty Officer Rudd not to waste his energy on anger.
It's time I took my own advice.
There's got to be a reason Hamilton's coming at us so strong.
'Cause we're close to taking him down.
The data card.
Yes.
Right now, only way to turn this thing around is to work the case.
Get the data card, find those suspects.
They lead us to Hamilton.
Where's Rudd?
Up in the conference room.
Okay.
You and Sebastian, try to pick up where Patton left off, get IDs on the other suspects.
Christopher, with me.
Last night, around the time Morgan ejected the data card from the camera, he called you on your cell.
It was right before the fight.
Called and said that he was running late, but that he wanted to talk.
And he never mentioned the camera or the data card?
Not a word.
You remember anything else about the call?
Nothing I haven't told you already.
Look, I called him back.
I asked him why he was gonna be late.
He said he was stuck at the church.
At Clearwater Baptist?
He called from the sanctuary.
Which was... weird.
Because Chaplain Morgan never allowed phones in the sanctuary.
There's a chance that's where he hid the data card.
Suspects turned the place upside down.
We ran through it with a fine-tooth comb.
Worth another look.
Let's go sweep the church again.
Come on.
What do you think you're doing?
Pride called you, right?
Told you about my little suspension.
No computer, no Internet, no security clearance.
You're making it sound so dramatic.
Go home, Doc.
You didn't see anything.
Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into?
I'm in the middle tracking the killers on the Morgan case.
I can't leave it half done.
Let Sebastian finish.
I love Sebastian like a tall, wiry, annoying younger brother, but he can't do what I do.
Patton, the stakes are high here.
We catch the killer, Pride has a chance to bring down Hamilton.
You touch that computer, the FBI won't care.
Is this worth risking your career over?
For Pride?
Of course.
The man stood by me when no one else would.
He didn't care about how it looked.
Or his career.
He just helped me.
So, please, Doc, with all the respect I have, let me do my damn job.
Damn it.
Aah!
You all right, Chris?
Aw, just my hand.
No, I mean, you all right?
I'm frustrated.
Seems like searching this place is a waste of time.
Especially with Sonja still in danger.
I know you did everything you could for her, King.
It's been rough...
Staying focused.
In control.
But we can't let Hamilton distract us.
We got to have faith we're gonna get Sonja out.
Bring Patton back.
Trust in the Word, right?
That's right.
Rudd.
"Trust in the Word."
That's what Morgan said before he died.
Yeah, he said it all the time.
But he was trying to get to you, specifically, in that ballroom.
What are you thinking, Pride?
The Bible.
If he, uh...
if he left anything in those pages, they would have found it already.
Yeah, you're right.
And the truth will be revealed.
Yeah.
We need to get this back to the squad room.
Let's go.
Hello?
Got to resist the urge to hang up.
This is too important.
Patton?
!
FBI gets word of this, we lose any shot at getting you back.
That is the least of your concerns if you don't listen.
I was able to hack Ansel Warshak's cell phone, download his correspondence.
You ID'd their associates?
I did, but listen, I'm tracking his GPS, pinged his location.
Okay, where are they?
At your doorstep.
They're closing in on the church, Dwayne.
Get down!
Hang up and call NOPD, Loretta.
We need backup, fast.
How did they find us?
Must've picked up your trail after you lost 'em, tracked us here.
They're looking for this data card.
We can't let 'em have it.
Ain't gonna last long against night vision goggles and submachine guns.
Yeah, by the time backup gets here they'll find us dead.
Any bright ideas?
Church got a storm generator?
Yeah, in the rear storage room.
All right.
Stay low and get to it.
When you hear my signal, throw the switch.
What's the signal?
Haven't figured that out yet.
You'll know it when you hear it.
Okay.
Gonna need a distraction.
You got it.
You sure you know what you're doing here?
Making it up as I go along.
Hands in the air!
Aah!
Christopher, all clear?
All clear.
You did good, Rudd.
You did good.
This is apparently what cost Chaplain Morgan his life.
That's the Heritage Boat Yard.
Footage is time-stamped the night of Morgan's murder.
It's Thursday night.
I've been tracking this crew.
I followed them here hoping to figure out what they're doing in Clearwater.
I'm trying to hear what they're talking about.
I'm gonna get closer.
Gentlemen, you're here because...
You recognize any of them?
Hard to say.
Doesn't look like the suspects we took out at the church.
The target arrives in New Orleans in approximately 48 hours under heavy security detail.
Memorize your entry and exit points...
Sounds like they're talking about some kind of hit.
Know your contingencies.
We can afford zero exposure.
Understood?
What was that?
Rewind that.
What was that?
Freeze it.
You know him.
Yeah, we do.
Mr. Stone,
Hamilton's guy.
Mayor's targeted our team.
Maybe it's time we come after his.
Romans 14:7 teaches...
"For none of us lives
"to himself, and none of us dies to himself."
"For if we live,
"we live to the Lord.
"And if we die, we die to the Lord."
See, Pastor Morgan...
He served the Lord.
And he served this town.
There is good in Clearwater.
There is right in Clearwater.
Pastor Morgan...
He never surrendered our home.
And we won't either.
We stand united and determined... as a community.
And we will never surrender.
It was a beautiful ceremony, huh, Dwayne?
Ah, it's a damn shame what happened to Chaplain Morgan, huh?
It wasn't a wasted life.
I can promise you that.
Okay, Dwayne.
Okay.
We're all set here, King.
Just give us the word and we'll move in, take this Mr. Stone down.
Stand down.
We're not arresting Stone.
We're gonna follow him.
You sure about that, Pride?
We got a hit team out there somewhere.
No idea of the target.
We want answers, we're gonna use Stone to lead us to 'em.
Take down Hamilton once and for all.
That's a dangerous game we're playing.
It's our only choice, Christopher.
Let's go.

Uh-oh.
Let me guess.
"Fun"?
You like this place so much, you just had to tell the world.
I get it.
I like it here, too.
This is Sergeant Dawson calling in vandalism on Pine Trail.
Suspect fleeing north on foot.
Copy that, Sergeant.
Told you, Jasper.
This place is fun.
Give it up, kid, before you get hurt!
Jasper, what's wrong?
Easy, boy.
Easy.
Whoa, buddy.
What's up?
Good ear, Jasper.
We better check that out.
Park police!
Anybody out here?
This is Dawson.
Hold me out at East Portico Stones.
Got a possible disturbance.
Copy that, Dawson.
State the nature of the disturbance.
Whoa.
Steady.
Sergeant Dawson, do you require assistance?

First aid.
Report writing.
And sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment training, really?
Did you even learn anything?
"If you make a pass, never harass."
That is not a thing.
Did you even take the class?
Please.
I taught the class.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
No, he actually got up in front of the room.
The instructor lost her voice and asked for volunteers.
Was she hot?
Case closed.
All right, we are almost done with these in-service training reports.
Almost?
Uh, we just did six classes in three days.
Yeah, because our senior field agent screwed the pooch.
Look, I'm sorry; human resources used to keep track of all the scheduling.
It's not my fault that they changed the system and made it my responsibility.
So, we're pretty much saving your job.
Well, point is, we're getting caught up.
And?
And we won't have to face any penalties.
And?
And thank you for saving my job.
Seriously.
But...
Nope.
No buts.
We still have to do the O-CAT.
Mm!
What is that, like, animal safety?
No, it's pepper spray training.
Every couple years, we all have to get recertified.
Yeah, which includes getting sprayed.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'll go easy on you guys.
Oh, no, no.
No, this is your fault.
No, you don't get to spray on us.
Who else is gonna do it?
You want help?
Uh, we're okay.
No way.
What?
Suit yourself.
Grab your gear.
We got a body?
In Rock Creek Park.
Gunnery Sergeant Remi Tanner.
We've seen a lot in this park, but this marble thing... that's a first.
Crushed by an ancient temple?
Well, that is technically correct, Alex.
While not religious in nature and certainly not ancient, these stones were once part of a temple built to honor democracy:
the United States Capitol.
In 1958, the East Portico was remodeled and the leftover stones stacked here.
Hmm.
This far off the beaten path?
I've never heard of this place.
It's a forgotten legacy.
Ah, but these stones witnessed the inauguration of every president from, oh, Andrew Jackson to Dwight D. Eisenhower.
They also witnessed the final moments of our Marine's life.
Killed by a little piece of history.
Yes, but look here.
Yeah, this man put up quite a fight before being crushed by government waste.
If there was a fight,
Jasper heard it first.
That's the only reason I stopped to listen.
We trust each other's instincts.
Does that include finding dead bodies?
For everything.
Trust makes mounted police work possible.
They're flight animals.
They run when they're scared.
How does that work in the big city?
Well, it doesn't.
Right.
We train them to follow their riders.
It could take years.
But a mounted officer can do more than ten on foot.
From crowd control to P.R.
People are more willing to approach someone on a horse.
How does the horse feel about that?
Well, they're social animals.
Damn, Gibbs.
Seems like opposites attract, huh?
You bring treats, Agent Gibbs?
What's in your pocket?
Just leftover breakfast, but it's not vegetarian, Jasper.
I am sorry about that.
Thanks, Dawson.
Come on, Jasper.
Let's go.
Well, now we know that horses don't like jacket jerky.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay.
Jody only attacks criminals.
Yeah, I always knew the ladies always loved the bad boys.
Uh, actually, Jody's male.
He's named after one of our fallen park police officers.
What are you doing, checking?
No, I'm just not a horse person, okay?
That's all right.
They're not horses.
They're cops.
Okay, what do we have?
Well, there's footprints around the body.
Untraceable, but it shows there was two attackers.
Found a cell phone case, but no phone, and $500 cash in the victim's wallet.
Mugging interrupted by Mister Ed?
Well, it was late and the park was closed.
Exactly, so what was our Marine doing here in the first place?
Agent Gibbs, over here!
Let's widen the search area.
Sorry, I thought Jasper was nosing after some crab apples, until I saw this burlap stuck in here.
Looks like blood, so I thought it might be evidence.
Let's see.
Animal skulls.
What the hell?
The lesser spot-nosed monkey, native to West African forests.
Now, that's a cute animal.
They were the source of the skulls found at the crime scene.
Not so cute.
Our victim, Gunnery Sergeant Tanner, was single and had a spotless record.
He was part of Marine Corps Forces Africa.
Just spent three months in Liberia, where his unit was sent to train wildlife rangers.
I've heard of that.
U.S. Marines teach non-lethal raid tactics-- flash-bangs, rubber bullets.
Apprehending poachers is dangerous business.
Well, these monkeys aren't endangered, but they're part of the illegal animal trade and sold as pets.
Not dead ones.
Why the skulls?
Maybe they're a message.
Revenge for Marine involvement in Africa?
Well, that still doesn't explain why the guy was in the park with a wallet full of cash.
Maybe the skulls were his.
What?
Why?
Skulls are valuable.
There's an entire American subculture obsessed with bone collecting.
How do you know that?
He dated Abby.
Ah.
I'm not saying the guy killed the monkeys himself, but maybe he brought home some souvenirs to sell.
And then things went bad.
Phone records night of the murder.
Uh, victim's missing cell phone has since been turned off or destroyed, but the last three calls were from the same person:
Phoebe Spitz.
Pick her up.
Well, Abby says
Miss Spitz is already on her way in.
Abby?
Yeah, apparently, she and Miss Spitz are friends;
they spoke this morning.
About what, skulls?
I have no idea, boss.
Abby said she'll explain later.
Tim, got your message and picked up those pepper sprays.
I'll have everybody sprayed and done by the week's end.
You're a lifesaver, Clayton.
Thank you.
Wait.
What's happening?
He put Reeves in charge?
Why?
Well, McGee claims that as British MI6, Clayton is an independent party.
Oh, I'm not giving either one of them the pleasure.
Look, we'll spray each other.
Huh?
You trust me.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I had to update my presentation.
What presentation?
Veterans Animal Patrol United.
It's an organization of U.S. military veterans who are dedicated to protecting wildlife around the world.
Oh, cool.
That's what I said.
So then I joined the board of directors last year and I met the founder, Miss Phoebe Spitz.
Doesn't she look awesome?
I love the camo.
Abby, I hate that picture.
I know, but it gets everybody's attention.
The photo helps with awareness, but it doesn't exactly capture our values.
You mean like death from above?
Peaceful conservation.
When I retired from the Marine Corps,
I made it my life's work.
I was trying to make it Tanner's, too.
I called last night to recruit him.
Three times?
Tanner kept hanging up on me.
I thought it was a bad connection.
Then Abby told me what happened.
It's horrible.
He was a good guy.
Was he an animal lover, as well?
Not at first, you know.
When Tanner's unit was first stationed in Liberia, he thought it was some kind of hippie-dippie P.R. stunt.
But then he was able to witness these animals in their natural habitat.
He was amazed to find out that elephants mourn their dead and rhinos dance before they mate.
Just like humans.
He was also amazed at how easy it is for poachers to kill these animals for their skins and ivory.
That was done with a chainsaw.
Oh, that's awful.
So, did he tell you why he was in Rock Creek Park last night?
Yeah, with monkey skulls?
No.
Our conversations were short.
He's been playing hard to get.
Is it possible maybe he was trying to sell them, the skulls?
No way.
Tanner may not have committed to my organization, but he was committed to these animals.
I thought you said this was about revenge.
Well, I... possibly, if we knew who might have a reason.
Oh, I-I do.
Here.
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, arrested last month.
So, he's in prison?
Yes, and Tanner's unit put him there.
Look, Best has a network of smugglers all around the world.
I wouldn't put it past him to put out some kind of bounty.
Did Tanner tell you that last night?
No.
Like I told you,
I have no idea what was going on in that park.
That's it.
Good boy.
All right.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa.
Bishop and McGee went to the victim's apartment.
All they found was his laptop.
I'm assuming this only makes sense to horse people?
Police horses have to train.
Pushing the ball teaches them to push a crowd, and the banging gets them used to city sounds.
You off duty?
Yeah, but I usually stick around to help train the horses.
And I heard you wanted to talk about recent park activity.
Yeah, crime patterns.
Anything new?
Unusual?
Like animal trafficking?
It's looking that way.
Disgusting.
Can't say we find a lot of tusks and furs laying around, but I would gladly sift through crime reports if it helps catch them.
Yeah, great.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
Horses are not dogs, man.
You don't miss a thing.
No, I'm saying, cats and dogs I understand, but anything bigger than a person,
I mean, it's just not a pet.
That's right.
They're livestock.
This is Officer Cole.
Hold me out at Bingham Road and Fern Trail.
Suspicious activity.
One suspect in custody.
That's near your crime scene.
Backup en route.
You drive, I'll point the way.
Cole, copy.
Um, I think they left.
Who the hell are you?
Under arrest, I think.
One minute this officer busts me for smoking a joint, the next he handcuffs me to this bench and takes off on his horse.
Why?
I'm pretty sure they were chasing someone, but I am kind of high.
Shots fired, shots fired.
Stay here with him.
Backup required at Fern Trail.
Cole.
Cole.
Oh, my God.
Officer down, officer down.
We need immediate medical assistance at Bingham and Fern.
Whoa, boy.
Whoa, Jody.
Whoa.
Dispatching EMT to Bingham and Fern.
Okay, all right, Cole.
I'm gonna apply some pressure.
This may hurt.
Gibbs, grab his bridal.
Hold on, Cole.
Whoa, whoa, Jody, whoa.
Help is coming.
You're gonna be okay.
Uh, Dawson.
Yeah?
Call the vet, too.
It's okay.
Easy, now.
I appreciate the update.
Okay.
Officer Cole is at Washington General with two chest wounds.
Doctors have their hands full.
Any word on the horse?
Yeah, he's being treated at the stable.
I don't understand how you guys are so emotional over a horse.
"A," I grew up on a farm and horses are beautiful animals.
And "B", these tears are the end of pepper spray.
Boom.
Wait, you guys let Reeves do it?
Hell no.
I was merely a witness to a whole new universe of foul language.
Oh, yeah.
Quinn has a potty mouth.
No, it was Ellie who raised the bar to Olympic heights.
Ah.
Even I blushed.
Well, I know six languages.
It's easy to get creative.
Thank you.
The international desk keeps getting calls from the Liberian embassy.
The ambassador wants to meet with Director Vance.
Uh, what for?
They haven't given me a reason.
Just keeps telling me it's urgent.
Huh.
Well, what happened at the park?
Well, Gibbs is talking to the only guy who might be able to tell us something.
Well, I was kind of high.
Things are a bit blurry.
Yeah, like your criminal record.
Nelson, you were arrested six years ago for airport drug trafficking.
You did prison time.
I've changed now.
So, what were you doing near a murder scene?
Murder?
Whoa.
Now, I mean, yes, I had pot, but that's legal in D.C.
And you'll find that bag weighs exactly 1.9 ounces, so you can't arrest me.
Unless we can prove intent to sell.
Even if I was selling-- and that's not an admission-- I'm not getting rich.
When I got out of prison, I downsized.
Ever hear of minimalism?
I cut my dreadlocks and got rid of everything I own.
I only buy what I need to live.
I don't even have a bank account.
You can check.
We did.
Where were you last night?
I was alone all night in my tiny house.
I park it all over.
My carbon footprint is very low.
Aside from smoking like a chimney.
That's the only reason I got busted.
You lit up in a public place.
It's against the law.
Apparently, horses can smell prime Kush for miles;
they caught me.
And left you.
Oh, yeah.
As he was writing me a ticket, the horse heard someone in the bushes.
It stopped and got real quiet.
He.
Horse is a he.
Okay.
He seemed to recognize a scent or something and got fidgety.
So, the officer cuffed me to the bench and let the horse lead the way.
Then you guys showed up and the gunshots started.
Did you see the person?
All I saw was a shadow.
It happened real fast.
That horse was like a Scud missile.
A stud missile.
Director Vance,
Liberian Ambassador Gabriel Moore.
Ambassador Moore, it's a pleasure.
You are dismissed.
Ambassador, would you like to sit...
Director Vance, my country was in the news this morning, and the only reason I found out was because I was watching.
Why was my embassy not first informed?
The news reported the murder of a decorated Marine.
Who was working with my government in Gola National Forest.
Training wildlife rangers, yes, but he was killed here in D.C.
Ambassador, forgive me, but your embassy was not very clear as to the nature of this meeting.
You have information to help our case?
I do not.
Then I'm confused.
About what?
About why you're angry with NCIS.
The victim was found with animal skulls, huh?
That was not reported in the news.
You will keep me informed before anything is made public.
Well...
I report to the Secretary of the Navy, but as a courtesy,
I'll be happy to keep you in the loop.
I will keep you updated.
It is my duty to make sure my country and its people are fairly represented on the world stage.
What exactly are you expecting?
I won't take up any more of your time.
Director.
Agent Gibbs.
Dawson.
How you holding up?
Cole just got out of surgery, so it's... touch and go.
But the doctors thought it went better than expected.
I know him, he's strong.
He'll make it through.
Which is why he's gonna need those riding boots back as soon as you finish processing them.
I also have Jody's tack out in my truck.
This is a joint investigation now, right?
Have a seat.
I prefer an outdoor office.
I meant to say nice work with Jody.
You didn't tell me you were a horse guy.
Yeah, that makes two of us.
Something about you standing next to a horse, that does seem symmetrical.
Jody seemed to think so, too.
That horse doesn't usually take so easily to strangers.
Was just following orders.
Oh, I have this.
The vet found this in Jody's mouth.
Hey, Quinn.
What is that?
It looks like bone or ivory.
Did the horse eat anything at the crime scene?
That's why I thought it would help.
Abbs, yeah.
I'm on the way down.
Right now.
Dawson, you waiting for an invitation?
Well, the park is my office.
This is yours.
Joint investigation.
Come on, let's go.
Marine gunny's car.
It was found parked in a lot outside Rock Creek Park.
So, he entered on foot.
Dawson, park police.
Abby, science police.
Anything tell you why he entered the park?
I'm still working on it, but this parking stub was found underneath one of the windshield wiper blades.
It's dated the night that he died, but there's no address, so still trying to track down where that came from.
That why you called?
Nope.
Then what do you got?
Evidence of a genocide.
Animal or human?
Insect.
The southern pine beetle.
Tree killer.
Yep.
That's why the Forest Service sprays infested areas with a poison called permethrin.
Guess what else had traces of permethrin on it.
How?
So glad you asked.
So the only local area that's recently been dusted is a remote stretch of land outside of Alexandria.
That's a national forest.
The bag was there?
Mm-hmm.
Two days ago, when it was sprayed.
The only structure in the spray zone is an old ranger shack.
Thanks, Abbs.
Did you try carrots?
What about his treats?
Well, then I'm out of ideas, but I'll visit tomorrow.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Jody.
Bullet wound?
Just a graze, no tissue damage.
The horse could gallop tomorrow, but Jody won't eat.
Well, he's used to the same person, riding him, feeding him, putting him away.
He knows something's wrong.
So you know your horses.
Got tire tracks.
Looks like a dually.
Box truck, maybe.
So you know your trucks.
I own trucks.
Got them and the horses in the divorce.
He got everything else.
What else is there?
His 23-year-old assistant.
You got the better part of that deal.
Damn right, I don't have to have dinner with the horses' sorority sisters.
That's a new lock.
About as secure as a screen door on a submarine.
Whoa.
Whatever's inside might need to stay in there.
Only one thing smells like that.
Dead body.
I was hoping for something different this time.
Mind if I get this over with?
Well, that's different.
It's called bushmeat.
Derived from animals native to Africa.
Bat, monkey, lion-- whatever the local population hunts for protein.
In Liberia.
Oh, in many countries all over Africa.
It's outlawed by their governments because it destroys the ecosystems.
Duck, this case isn't about rhino horns or elephant tusks.
No, it's about food.
So what's it doing in the U.S.?
Jethro, illegal bushmeat is a worldwide, billion-dollar business.
It's smoked, smuggled into the country, and then sold on the street to expatriate communities.
Taste of home.
Well, never underestimate the power of nostalgia.
Mere pounds can go for hundreds of dollars.
It's a health risk.
Well, the greatest fear is of an unknown and catastrophic disease.
You see, smoking the meat does not kill off all the bacteria.
Sounds like nightmare soup.
It's a shame.
I used to like soup.
What do you have?
Uh, maybe a little good news.
That's a welcome change.
I know why our killer stole our victim's cell phone:
he was taking pictures of them.
But our dead Marine had a cloud account that automatically uploads any cell phone pictures.
No clear faces, but they tell a story.
The bushmeat must be in those bags.
Including the skulls.
Well, they're used to prove the meat's origin and worth.
Either way,
I think these guys were headed to the park to sell it.
Our Marine followed them.
Mm-hmm.
He hid in the bushes, but they must have seen him and attacked.
When Dawson showed up, the killers ditched the monkey skulls.
They came back yesterday.
Which is when they shot Officer Cole and his horse.
But it is looking like our dead Marine was one of the good guys.
An animal lover to the last.
This is what you wouldn't say, what you thought this case was leading to.
My apologies, Director Vance.
It is both a source of great pride and embarrassment.
Have a seat.
We... are a nation of survivors.
Slavery, civil wars.
We strive for progress, but many are still poor, and cattle production is difficult and costly.
Bushmeat has been a way of life for generations.
Which is why it can wipe out animal populations.
It is unsustainable and a health risk.
My government desperately tries to teach this to the public.
But food is also a cultural touchstone.
Used for celebrations, weddings, christenings.
More reasons it's smuggled into our country.
Old habits die hard.
Sorry, that's another turn of phrase.
It's difficult to change minds.
Even more so to change hearts.
Ah.
Many Liberian citizens believe the government to be weak or corrupt.
Sometimes it is true.
But I am here to offer any assistance you may require.
Anything, please.
I appreciate that.
And I just might have something in mind.
Undercover?
Ambassador Moore has agreed to lead you through a local street market where he believes bushmeat is being sold.
Market vendors can lead us to the smugglers.
Yeah, and the killers, I get it.
Why did he ask for me?
Said he liked you.
He liked me?
The man said two things to me:
"Hello," and then "Get out of the room."
I'm pretty sure he thought I was the butler.
So did I at first.
Reeves, Jeeves.
So confusing.
That's funny.
I can also think of something that rhymes with "Nick."
- Slick?
- Try again.
Quinn, everything okay?
Uh, no, just got off the phone with the hospital.
It seems that Officer Cole's internal bleeding didn't stop, so he died an hour ago.
Looks like we've got two murders on our hands.
Boss, did you hear about this?
Find the source of that meat.
Gentlemen, come, come.
You need spices?
I have spices.
Tsire has a lovely flavor.
Peanuts and spices, perfect for meat.
That is the problem.
We have no meat.
Perhaps you can help us?
This is a market.
There is plenty of meat.
You pick something.
I have spices to make it delicious.
Uh, no, no, no, no.
I want to cook my friend a piece of home.
Mm-hmm.
I need bushmeat.
What is the word you said?
Bushmeat, please.
This is America.
I am an American.
I don't know about that.
Now, go.
Go!
No one's willing to talk to us.
Patience.
The word will spread.
Someone always wants to make money, huh?
Is it odd this is making me hungry?
Everyone gets hungry.
Even butlers.
Fresh veggies, gentlemen!
Come try some.
No, thanks.
One taste can change your mind.
You did say you were hungry.
- Wait, I know you.
- I...
I don't think so.
Yes, yes, yes,
You are a government man.
Please, keep your voice down, huh?
Oh, I will.
If the rich government man donates to the knife show.
Knife show?
You've got a long way before you turn pro.
I am flawless.
Hardly.
Look at your ear.
Practice makes perfect.
Yeah, clearly you need lots of it.
Hey, Clayton, pay the man and let it be, huh?
We do not want trouble.
Let go of me!
She did not pay for that!
I saw you!
Who do you think you are?
You cannot come to our market and just think you can take...
All right, all right, break it up!
That's enough!
Break it up!
Hey, that's enough!
Or I start spraying!
Get off her!
I've recently seen how nasty this stuff is.
I really don't want to use it.
Okay?
So stop.
Please.
Who the hell are you?
She was stealing from us!
I can explain.
Thanks for returning Cole's boots.
The familiar scent and visual can help them understand.
Help them...
grieve and move on.
Worth a shot.
I agree.
Question is: how did you know to bring the boots?
I know that you'd want Cole's badge.
We're finished with processing.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Really thought that he'd pull through.
You two were close.
Yeah, I trained him.
And right now I'm wondering if I did a good enough job.
This place, these people, they're family.
I think you did everything right.
Jody still won't eat.
Sounds funny, but you know, they get depressed.
Yeah, I've seen that before.
My daughter, Kelly, she used to ride down by the beach.
There was this stable near the water, owned by an old Korean War vet.
He started calling her Sergeant Reckless.
After the war horse, why?
One summer, his wife died, and her horse wouldn't ride, wouldn't eat.
Kelly noticed that, and she made it her project.
Horse ignored her.
But she kept going back.
Every day.
Until the horse started eating.
Mm-hmm.
She knew that that horse just needed a buddy.
Sergeant Reckless, because like the war horse, your daughter was a lifesaver.
So horse sense runs in the family.
No.
Uh, that was all her.
I saw the way that you were with Jody yesterday.
You're just what he needs to break his funk.
Funk?
Everybody here has already tried everything;
this horse is as stubborn as they come, and I think he's finally met his match, Gibbs.
At least, I hope so, anyways, if you're willing.
A horse that doesn't eat, dies.
I was only trying to help.
Okay, last time I was here,
NCIS thought my friend was guilty, so I wanted to clear his name.
I was there, asking questions about bushmeat.
No one would answer me, so I started poking around.
They thought you were stealing.
Because they're hiding something.
I didn't find anything to prove that, but I can tell.
Wait a minute.
Who told you the murder had to do with bushmeat?
Abby.
Okay.
What else do we have?
Nothing.
We've hit a dead end.
No leads on the bushmeat or the smuggling pipeline.
Okay, first thing.
I only talked to Phoebe because she knew the victim.
I didn't know she was gonna go commando.
What's the second thing?
Okay, the second thing should be the first thing.
I used the wildlife DNA database to track all the animals from the meat shack.
They all came from the Gbarma District of Liberia.
Is that good or bad?
It's a bad thing.
A small village in Gbarma just reported an Ebola outbreak.
All the meat downstairs was clear.
Next shipment won't be.
No.
We have to cut off this pipeline, now.
Okay, CDC, FDA and the FAA have all been notified.
FAA?
According to the USDA, bushmeat gets into the country via airports.
How many different agencies are involved with this stuff?
Well, I left out FWS, who said the meat can be hidden in shipments of fish or other legal foods.
But mostly, it's just smuggled in suitcases.
Well, you won't find that in the food court.
Point is, a shipment tainted with Ebola has its way of getting here.
We're gonna stop them.
Yeah, we're trying, boss.
We've been through all the Liberian Intel.
Government surveillance on poachers and known players in the animal trade.
A lot of suspects.
But none in the U.S.
Dead end.
Whoa, wait.
Stop.
Go back.
Right there.
Who's that?
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, but he's in prison in Liberia.
Who's that with him?
The dreadlock guy?
Uh, I can't tell.
You know what?
Our Marine has more photos from that same batch on his laptop.
Boss, is that...?
Nelson, our park stoner.
He said he quit trafficking illegal drugs, which was true.
Yeah, well, he got into bushmeat.
Different product, same illegal pipeline.
Airport connections.
Guy was broke.
If he's a kingpin, where's the money?
He was never a kingpin.
He was an avenue to get to U.S. soil.
He's getting the meat from someplace overseas, so I'm betting that that's where the money is, too.
It's an offshore account.
Yeah.
Still raises a lot of questions.
And I got answers.
And maracas.
Ah!
They had them at the pawn shop.
Oh, you owe me $10.
Oh, Abby will explain.
Oh, I gave, uh, my maracas to a friend of mine.
No, uh, explain the other thing.
Right.
So, I finally tracked down the parking stub from the Marine's car to a parking garage by a pawn shop downtown.
Here.
I checked it out.
Tanner pawned a guitar the night he died.
Deposit for a new apartment.
Explains the cash in his wallet.
Also explains how he found Nelson.
Got security footage from the parking garage.
Can you fast forward to 9:47 p.m., please?
Yep.
And there's our stoner.
And Gunnery Sergeant Tanner walked right by him.
Yeah, he bumped into him in the parking lot.
Purely by chance.
He recognized him.
Probably from the same photo you did, Gibbs.
Also, Tanner's been studying those poacher files for at least three months.
He must have followed Nelson all the way to the park.
Where is he now?
No permanent address.
He does live in a mobile tiny house.
What about his accomplice?
The guy who shot Officer Cole and the horse does not show up on the video.
But I might have a lead, and straight from the horse's mouth.
Someone had to say it.
So how much jewelry did you have to go through before you found a match?
A lot.
Ivory's still way too popular.
Uh, the piece from Jody's mouth was from a spiral taper earring.
Thought horses were vegetarians.
Well, they are, but this one was smart enough to take a bite out of the shooter.
Yeah.
His bloody ear wasn't from his knife act.
Oh, he's on the move.
Look.
Heads up, gang.
We got a truck.
McGee, you three have the street.
It's a busy place.
Not ideal for a takedown.
Wait on my signal.
Hurry up.
Come on, I called you two hours ago.
Between the park yesterday and the market today, police are too close.
Then forget your stuff so we can get the hell out of here.
If we can get out of the country, my uncle will hide us in Monrovia.
I don't need your uncle.
Let's go.
Bishop, Torres, move.
Federal agents!
The police, they're here!
Then you better get out of the way.
Gun!
NCIS!
It's over!
Put your hands in the air!
Don't shoot!
This is exactly how they train rangers to take down poachers.
Two arrests have been made in connection with the smuggling of illegal bushmeat into the United States.
Meat tainted with the Ebola virus...
Congratulations, Director.
Two smugglers gave up their airport contacts pretty fast.
Be assured, my government is following up in Liberia.
This will not end here.
Ball's in your court now.
That idiom I know.
Press conference is in an hour.
Director.
Please be mindful in your media portrayal of my government.
It is a powerful tool that could help build trust.
This press conference will be seen back home.
Which is why you're giving the opening statement.
I beg your pardon?
I can't think of anything more powerful than your country seeing a proud and committed public servant.
Thank you.
Now, that's just, um...
that's just beautiful.
Park police said he was born this morning and that they named him after fallen officer Cole.
Mm.
Cole the foal.
Just...
Who's crying over a horse now?
Oh, come on.
It's pepper spray, come on.
Nick, that was three hours ago.
Nick.
Got great news.
What's up, Tim?
Um...
You know what, never mind.
Come on, tell me.
What's up?
Okay, um...
It's a, it's kind of a funny story, really.
The, uh, the OCAT training.
I just came from HR.
Turns out they, uh, they mixed up the dates.
We're not due until next year.
We didn't have to get sprayed?
Oops.
"Oops"?
Okay, Reeves, hand it over.
I'm sorry, Tim, but I am an independent party.
What?
What are you doing?
No.
Oh, come on.
That's funny.
Very funny, very funny.
Any last words before we take this outside?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on.
This-this is not my fault.
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
Good to have you back, pal.
What changed, huh?
Gibbs, you've been here all night?
What did you do?
What?
He's eating.
Tell me what you did.
I could get you a coffee or an aspirin.
That's a mighty hard floor.
No.
We don't mind.
Do we, Jody?
He just needed a buddy.
Well, you know, Jody could also use a ride, if you're up for it.
What do you think?
Okay.

BISHOP:
Gunnery Sergeant Remi Tanner.
We've seen a lot in this park, but this marble thing... that's a first.
Crushed by an ancient temple?
DUCKY:
Well, that is technically correct, Alex.
While not religious in nature and certainly not ancient, these stones were once part of a temple built to honor democracy:
the United States Capitol.
In 1958, the East Portico was remodeled and the leftover stones stacked here.
BISHOP:
Hmm.
This far off the beaten path?
I've never heard of this place.
DUCKY:
It's a forgotten legacy.
Ah, but these stones witnessed the inauguration of every president from, oh, Andrew Jackson to Dwight D. Eisenhower.
They also witnessed the final moments of our Marine's life.
Killed by a little piece of history.
DUCKY:
Yes, but look here.
Yeah, this man put up quite a fight before being crushed by government waste.
DAWSON:
If there was a fight,
Jasper heard it first.
That's the only reason I stopped to listen.
We trust each other's instincts.
(pats Jasper)
TORRES:
Does that include finding dead bodies?
DAWSON:
For everything.
Trust makes mounted police work possible.
They're flight animals.
They run when they're scared.
How does that work in the big city?
Well, it doesn't.
Right.
We train them to follow their riders.
It could take years.
But a mounted officer can do more than ten on foot.
From crowd control to P.R.
People are more willing to approach someone on a horse.

(laughs) Now, that's a cute animal.
BISHOP:
They were the source of the skulls found at the crime scene.
Not so cute.
Our victim, Gunnery Sergeant Tanner, was single and had a spotless record.
He was part of Marine Corps Forces Africa.
Just spent three months in Liberia, where his unit was sent to train wildlife rangers.
BISHOP:
I've heard of that.
U.S. Marines teach non-lethal raid tactics-- flash-bangs, rubber bullets.
Apprehending poachers is dangerous business.
BISHOP:
Well, these monkeys aren't endangered, but they're part of the illegal animal trade and sold as pets.
Not dead ones.
Why the skulls?
Maybe they're a message.
Revenge for Marine involvement in Africa?
Well, that still doesn't explain why the guy was in the park with a wallet full of cash.
Maybe the skulls were his.
What?
Why?
McGEE:
Skulls are valuable.
There's an entire American subculture obsessed with bone collecting.
How do you know that?
He dated Abby.
Ah.
I'm not saying the guy killed the monkeys himself, but maybe he brought home some souvenirs to sell.
And then things went bad.
Phone records night of the murder.
Uh, victim's missing cell phone has since been turned off or destroyed, but the last three calls were from the same person:
Phoebe Spitz.
Pick her up.
Well, Abby says
Miss Spitz is already on her way in.
Abby?
McGEE:
Yeah, apparently, she and Miss Spitz are friends;
they spoke this morning.
About what, skulls?
I have no idea, boss.
Abby said she'll explain later.
Tim, got your message and picked up those pepper sprays.
I'll have everybody sprayed and done by the week's end.
You're a lifesaver, Clayton.
Thank you.
Wait.
What's happening?
He put Reeves in charge?
Why?
Well, McGee claims that as British MI6, Clayton is an independent party.
Oh, I'm not giving either one of them the pleasure.
Look, we'll spray each other.
Huh?
You trust me.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I had to update my presentation.
What presentation?
Veterans Animal Patrol United.
It's an organization of U.S. military veterans who are dedicated to protecting wildlife around the world.
Oh, cool.
That's what I said.
So then I joined the board of directors last year and I met the founder, Miss Phoebe Spitz.
Doesn't she look awesome?
I love the camo.
Abby, I hate that picture.
I know, but it gets everybody's attention.
The photo helps with awareness, but it doesn't exactly capture our values.
You mean like death from above?
Peaceful conservation.
When I retired from the Marine Corps,
I made it my life's work.
I was trying to make it Tanner's, too.
I called last night to recruit him.
Three times?
Tanner kept hanging up on me.
I thought it was a bad connection.
Then Abby told me what happened.
It's horrible.
He was a good guy.
Was he an animal lover, as well?
Not at first, you know.
When Tanner's unit was first stationed in Liberia, he thought it was some kind of hippie-dippie P.R. stunt.
But then he was able to witness these animals in their natural habitat.
He was amazed to find out that elephants mourn their dead and rhinos dance before they mate.
Just like humans.
PHOEBE:
He was also amazed at how easy it is for poachers to kill these animals for their skins and ivory.
That was done with a chainsaw.
Oh, that's awful.
So, did he tell you why he was in Rock Creek Park last night?
Yeah, with monkey skulls?
No.
Our conversations were short.
He's been playing hard to get.
Is it possible maybe he was trying to sell them, the skulls?
No way.
Tanner may not have committed to my organization, but he was committed to these animals.
I thought you said this was about revenge.
Well, I... possibly, if we knew who might have a reason.
Oh, I-I do.
Here.
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, arrested last month.
So, he's in prison?
Yes, and Tanner's unit put him there.
Look, Best has a network of smugglers all around the world.
I wouldn't put it past him to put out some kind of bounty.
Did Tanner tell you that last night?
No.
Like I told you,
I have no idea what was going on in that park.
(horse neighs)
(trash can lids banging)
That's it.
Good boy.
TORRES:
All right.
Thank you.
MAN:
Whoa, whoa.
(horse neighs)
Bishop and McGee went to the victim's apartment.
All they found was his laptop.
(horse snorting)
I'm assuming this only makes sense to horse people?
Police horses have to train.
Pushing the ball teaches them to push a crowd, and the banging gets them used to city sounds.
You off duty?
Yeah, but I usually stick around to help train the horses.
And I heard you wanted to talk about recent park activity.
Yeah, crime patterns.
Anything new?
Unusual?
Like animal trafficking?
It's looking that way.
Disgusting.
Can't say we find a lot of tusks and furs laying around, but I would gladly sift through crime reports if it helps catch them.
Yeah, great.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
Horses are not dogs, man.
You don't miss a thing.
No, I'm saying, cats and dogs I understand, but anything bigger than a person,
I mean, it's just not a pet.
That's right.
They're livestock.
COLE (over radio):
This is Officer Cole.
Hold me out at Bingham Road and Fern Trail.
Suspicious activity.
One suspect in custody.
That's near your crime scene.
Backup en route.
You drive, I'll point the way.
Cole, copy.
NELSON:
Um, I think they left.
Who the hell are you?
Under arrest, I think.
One minute this officer busts me for smoking a joint, the next he handcuffs me to this bench and takes off on his horse.
Why?
I'm pretty sure they were chasing someone, but I am kind of high.
(gunfire in distance)
Shots fired, shots fired.
Stay here with him.
DAWSON:
Backup required at Fern Trail.
Cole.
Cole.
Oh, my God.
Officer down, officer down.
We need immediate medical assistance at Bingham and Fern.
Whoa, boy.
(neighing)
Whoa, Jody.
Whoa.
DISPATCHER:
Dispatching EMT to Bingham and Fern.
(neighing continues)
Okay, all right, Cole.
I'm gonna apply some pressure.
This may hurt.
Gibbs, grab his bridal.
Hold on, Cole.
Whoa, whoa, Jody, whoa.
Help is coming.
You're gonna be okay.
(neighs softly)
Uh, Dawson.
Yeah?
Call the vet, too.
It's okay.
Easy, now.
I appreciate the update.
Okay.
Officer Cole is at Washington General with two chest wounds.
Doctors have their hands full.
(sighs)
Any word on the horse?
Yeah, he's being treated at the stable.
I don't understand how you guys are so emotional over a horse.
"A," I grew up on a farm and horses are beautiful animals.
And "B", these tears are the end of pepper spray.
Boom.
(chuckles)
Wait, you guys let Reeves do it?
Hell no.
(sniffles)
I was merely a witness to a whole new universe of foul language.
Oh, yeah.
Quinn has a potty mouth.
REEVES:
No, it was Ellie who raised the bar to Olympic heights.
QUINN:
Ah.
Even I blushed.
Well, I know six languages.
It's easy to get creative.
REEVES:
Thank you.
The international desk keeps getting calls from the Liberian embassy.
The ambassador wants to meet with Director Vance.
Uh, what for?
They haven't given me a reason.
Just keeps telling me it's urgent.
Huh.
Well, what happened at the park?
Well, Gibbs is talking to the only guy who might be able to tell us something.
NELSON:
Well, I was kind of high.
Things are a bit blurry.
Yeah, like your criminal record.
Nelson, you were arrested six years ago for airport drug trafficking.
You did prison time.
I've changed now.
So, what were you doing near a murder scene?
Murder?
Whoa.
Now, I mean, yes, I had pot, but that's legal in D.C.
And you'll find that bag weighs exactly 1.9 ounces, so you can't arrest me.
Unless we can prove intent to sell.
Even if I was selling-- and that's not an admission-- I'm not getting rich.
When I got out of prison, I downsized.
Ever hear of minimalism?
I cut my dreadlocks and got rid of everything I own.
I only buy what I need to live.
I don't even have a bank account.
You can check.
We did.
Where were you last night?
I was alone all night in my tiny house.
I park it all over.
My carbon footprint is very low.
Aside from smoking like a chimney.
That's the only reason I got busted.
McGEE:
You lit up in a public place.
It's against the law.
Apparently, horses can smell prime Kush for miles;
they caught me.
And left you.
Oh, yeah.
As he was writing me a ticket, the horse heard someone in the bushes.
It stopped and got real quiet.
He.
Horse is a he.
Okay.
He seemed to recognize a scent or something and got fidgety.
So, the officer cuffed me to the bench and let the horse lead the way.
Then you guys showed up and the gunshots started.
Did you see the person?
All I saw was a shadow.
It happened real fast.
That horse was like a Scud missile.
A stud missile.
(laughing)
Director Vance,
Liberian Ambassador Gabriel Moore.
Ambassador Moore, it's a pleasure.
You are dismissed.
Ambassador, would you like to sit...
Director Vance, my country was in the news this morning, and the only reason I found out was because I was watching.
Why was my embassy not first informed?
The news reported the murder of a decorated Marine.
Who was working with my government in Gola National Forest.
Training wildlife rangers, yes, but he was killed here in D.C.
Ambassador, forgive me, but your embassy was not very clear as to the nature of this meeting.
You have information to help our case?
I do not.
Then I'm confused.
About what?
About why you're angry with NCIS.
The victim was found with animal skulls, huh?
That was not reported in the news.
You will keep me informed before anything is made public.
Well...
I report to the Secretary of the Navy, but as a courtesy,
I'll be happy to keep you in the loop.
I will keep you updated.
It is my duty to make sure my country and its people are fairly represented on the world stage.
What exactly are you expecting?
I won't take up any more of your time.
Director.
Agent Gibbs.
Dawson.
How you holding up?
Cole just got out of surgery, so it's... touch and go.
But the doctors thought it went better than expected.
I know him, he's strong.
He'll make it through.
Which is why he's gonna need those riding boots back as soon as you finish processing them.
I also have Jody's tack out in my truck.
This is a joint investigation now, right?
Have a seat.
I prefer an outdoor office.
I meant to say nice work with Jody.
You didn't tell me you were a horse guy.
Yeah, that makes two of us.
Something about you standing next to a horse, that does seem symmetrical.
Jody seemed to think so, too.
That horse doesn't usually take so easily to strangers.
Was just following orders.
Oh, I have this.
The vet found this in Jody's mouth.
Hey, Quinn.
What is that?
It looks like bone or ivory.
(phone ringing)
Did the horse eat anything at the crime scene?
That's why I thought it would help.
GIBBS:
Abbs, yeah.
I'm on the way down.
Right now.
Dawson, you waiting for an invitation?
Well, the park is my office.
This is yours.
Joint investigation.
Come on, let's go.
(elevator bell dings)
Marine gunny's car.
It was found parked in a lot outside Rock Creek Park.
So, he entered on foot.
Dawson, park police.
Abby, science police.
Anything tell you why he entered the park?
I'm still working on it, but this parking stub was found underneath one of the windshield wiper blades.
It's dated the night that he died, but there's no address, so still trying to track down where that came from.
That why you called?
Nope.
Then what do you got?
Evidence of a genocide.
Animal or human?
Insect.
The southern pine beetle.
DAWSON:
Tree killer.
Yep.
That's why the Forest Service sprays infested areas with a poison called permethrin.
Guess what else had traces of permethrin on it.
How?
So glad you asked.
So the only local area that's recently been dusted is a remote stretch of land outside of Alexandria.
That's a national forest.
The bag was there?
Mm-hmm.
Two days ago, when it was sprayed.
The only structure in the spray zone is an old ranger shack.
Thanks, Abbs.
DAWSON:
Did you try carrots?
What about his treats?
Well, then I'm out of ideas, but I'll visit tomorrow.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Jody.
Bullet wound?
Just a graze, no tissue damage.
The horse could gallop tomorrow, but Jody won't eat.
Well, he's used to the same person, riding him, feeding him, putting him away.
He knows something's wrong.
So you know your horses.
Got tire tracks.
Looks like a dually.
(camera clicks)
Box truck, maybe.
So you know your trucks.
I own trucks.
Got them and the horses in the divorce.
He got everything else.
What else is there?
His 23-year-old assistant.
You got the better part of that deal.
Damn right, I don't have to have dinner with the horses' sorority sisters.
That's a new lock.
DAWSON:
About as secure as a screen door on a submarine.
Whoa.
Whatever's inside might need to stay in there.
(clears throat)
Only one thing smells like that.
Dead body.
I was hoping for something different this time.
Mind if I get this over with?
(flies buzzing)
Well, that's different.
It's called bushmeat.
Derived from animals native to Africa.
Bat, monkey, lion-- whatever the local population hunts for protein.
In Liberia.
Oh, in many countries all over Africa.
It's outlawed by their governments because it destroys the ecosystems.
Duck, this case isn't about rhino horns or elephant tusks.
No, it's about food.
So what's it doing in the U.S.?
Jethro, illegal bushmeat is a worldwide, billion-dollar business.
It's smoked, smuggled into the country, and then sold on the street to expatriate communities.
Taste of home.
Well, never underestimate the power of nostalgia.
Mere pounds can go for hundreds of dollars.
It's a health risk.
Well, the greatest fear is of an unknown and catastrophic disease.
You see, smoking the meat does not kill off all the bacteria.
Sounds like nightmare soup.
It's a shame.
I used to like soup.
What do you have?
Uh, maybe a little good news.
That's a welcome change.
I know why our killer stole our victim's cell phone:
he was taking pictures of them.
But our dead Marine had a cloud account that automatically uploads any cell phone pictures.
No clear faces, but they tell a story.
The bushmeat must be in those bags.
Including the skulls.
Well, they're used to prove the meat's origin and worth.
BISHOP:
Either way,
I think these guys were headed to the park to sell it.
Our Marine followed them.
Mm-hmm.
He hid in the bushes, but they must have seen him and attacked.
When Dawson showed up, the killers ditched the monkey skulls.
They came back yesterday.
Which is when they shot Officer Cole and his horse.
But it is looking like our dead Marine was one of the good guys.
An animal lover to the last.
VANCE:
This is what you wouldn't say, what you thought this case was leading to.
My apologies, Director Vance.
It is both a source of great pride and embarrassment.
Have a seat.
We... are a nation of survivors.
Slavery, civil wars.
We strive for progress, but many are still poor, and cattle production is difficult and costly.
Bushmeat has been a way of life for generations.
Which is why it can wipe out animal populations.
It is unsustainable and a health risk.
My government desperately tries to teach this to the public.
But food is also a cultural touchstone.
Used for celebrations, weddings, christenings.
More reasons it's smuggled into our country.
Old habits die hard.
Sorry, that's another turn of phrase.
It's difficult to change minds.
Even more so to change hearts.
Ah.
Many Liberian citizens believe the government to be weak or corrupt.
Sometimes it is true.
But I am here to offer any assistance you may require.
Anything, please.
I appreciate that.
And I just might have something in mind.
Undercover?
Ambassador Moore has agreed to lead you through a local street market where he believes bushmeat is being sold.
Market vendors can lead us to the smugglers.
Yeah, and the killers, I get it.
Why did he ask for me?
Said he liked you.
He liked me?
The man said two things to me:
"Hello," and then "Get out of the room."
I'm pretty sure he thought I was the butler.
So did I at first.
Reeves, Jeeves.
So confusing.
That's funny.
I can also think of something that rhymes with "Nick."
- Slick?
- Try again.
Quinn, everything okay?
Uh, no, just got off the phone with the hospital.
It seems that Officer Cole's internal bleeding didn't stop, so he died an hour ago.
Looks like we've got two murders on our hands.
Boss, did you hear about this?
Find the source of that meat.
(elevator bell dings)
(elevator bell dings)
(upbeat African music playing, food sizzling)
(lively crowd chatter)
(bleating)
WOMAN:
Gentlemen, come, come.
You need spices?
I have spices.
Tsire has a lovely flavor.
Peanuts and spices, perfect for meat.
MOORE:
That is the problem.
We have no meat.
Perhaps you can help us?
This is a market.
There is plenty of meat.
You pick something.
I have spices to make it delicious.
MOORE:
Uh, no, no, no, no.
I want to cook my friend a piece of home.
Mm-hmm.
I need bushmeat.
What is the word you said?
Bushmeat, please.
This is America.
I am an American.
I don't know about that.
Now, go.
Go!
(sighs)
No one's willing to talk to us.
Patience.
The word will spread.
Someone always wants to make money, huh?
Is it odd this is making me hungry?
Everyone gets hungry.
Even butlers.
MAN:
Fresh veggies, gentlemen!
Come try some.
No, thanks.
One taste can change your mind.
You did say you were hungry.
Wait, I know you.
MOORE:
I...
I don't think so.
Yes, yes, yes,
You are a government man.
Please, keep your voice down, huh?
Oh, I will.
If the rich government man donates to the knife show.
Knife show?
You've got a long way before you turn pro.
I am flawless.
Hardly.
Look at your ear.
Practice makes perfect.
Yeah, clearly you need lots of it.
Hey, Clayton, pay the man and let it be, huh?
We do not want trouble.
WOMAN:
Let go of me!
She did not pay for that!
I saw you!
Who do you think you are?
You cannot come to our market and just think you can take...
All right, all right, break it up!
That's enough!
Break it up!
Hey, that's enough!
Or I start spraying!
Get off her!
I've recently seen how nasty this stuff is.
I really don't want to use it.
Okay?
So stop.
Please.
Who the hell are you?
She was stealing from us!
I can explain.
DAWSON:
Thanks for returning Cole's boots.
The familiar scent and visual can help them understand.
Help them...
grieve and move on.
Worth a shot.
I agree.
Question is: how did you know to bring the boots?
(chuckles)
I know that you'd want Cole's badge.
We're finished with processing.
Thank you.
(softly):
Yeah.
Really thought that he'd pull through.
You two were close.
Yeah, I trained him.
And right now I'm wondering if I did a good enough job.
This place, these people, they're family.
I think you did everything right.
Jody still won't eat.
Sounds funny, but you know, they get depressed.
Yeah, I've seen that before.
My daughter, Kelly, she used to ride down by the beach.
There was this stable near the water, owned by an old Korean War vet.
He started calling her Sergeant Reckless.
After the war horse, why?
One summer, his wife died, and her horse wouldn't ride, wouldn't eat.
Kelly noticed that, and she made it her project.
Horse ignored her.
But she kept going back.
Every day.
Until the horse started eating.
Mm-hmm.
She knew that that horse just needed a buddy.
Sergeant Reckless, because like the war horse, your daughter was a lifesaver.
(chuckles)
So horse sense runs in the family.
No.
Uh, that was all her.
I saw the way that you were with Jody yesterday.
You're just what he needs to break his funk.
Funk?
Everybody here has already tried everything;
this horse is as stubborn as they come, and I think he's finally met his match, Gibbs.
At least, I hope so, anyways, if you're willing.
A horse that doesn't eat, dies.
I was only trying to help.
Okay, last time I was here,
NCIS thought my friend was guilty, so I wanted to clear his name.
I was there, asking questions about bushmeat.
No one would answer me, so I started poking around.
They thought you were stealing.
Because they're hiding something.
I didn't find anything to prove that, but I can tell.
Wait a minute.
Who told you the murder had to do with bushmeat?
Abby.
Okay.
What else do we have?
Nothing.
We've hit a dead end.
No leads on the bushmeat or the smuggling pipeline.
(door opens, closes)
Okay, first thing.
I only talked to Phoebe because she knew the victim.
I didn't know she was gonna go commando.
What's the second thing?
Okay, the second thing should be the first thing.
I used the wildlife DNA database to track all the animals from the meat shack.
They all came from the Gbarma District of Liberia.
Is that good or bad?
It's a bad thing.
A small village in Gbarma just reported an Ebola outbreak.
All the meat downstairs was clear.
Next shipment won't be.
No.
We have to cut off this pipeline, now.
Okay, CDC, FDA and the FAA have all been notified.
FAA?
According to the USDA, bushmeat gets into the country via airports.
How many different agencies are involved with this stuff?
Well, I left out FWS, who said the meat can be hidden in shipments of fish or other legal foods.
But mostly, it's just smuggled in suitcases.
Well, you won't find that in the food court.
Point is, a shipment tainted with Ebola has its way of getting here.
We're gonna stop them.
McGEE:
Yeah, we're trying, boss.
We've been through all the Liberian Intel.
Government surveillance on poachers and known players in the animal trade.
McGEE:
A lot of suspects.
BISHOP:
But none in the U.S.
Dead end.
Whoa, wait.
Stop.
Go back.
Right there.
Who's that?
BISHOP:
Ousmane Best.
He's a big-time poacher, but he's in prison in Liberia.
Who's that with him?
The dreadlock guy?
Uh, I can't tell.
You know what?
Our Marine has more photos from that same batch on his laptop.
Boss, is that...?
ABBY:
Nelson, our park stoner.
He said he quit trafficking illegal drugs, which was true.
Yeah, well, he got into bushmeat.
Different product, same illegal pipeline.
Airport connections.
Guy was broke.
If he's a kingpin, where's the money?
He was never a kingpin.
He was an avenue to get to U.S. soil.
He's getting the meat from someplace overseas, so I'm betting that that's where the money is, too.
It's an offshore account.
Yeah.
Still raises a lot of questions.
TORRES:
And I got answers.
And maracas.
(maracas shaking)
Ah!
They had them at the pawn shop.
TORRES:
Oh, you owe me $10.
Oh, Abby will explain.
Oh, I gave, uh, my maracas to a friend of mine.
No, uh, explain the other thing.
Right.
So, I finally tracked down the parking stub from the Marine's car to a parking garage by a pawn shop downtown.
Here.
I checked it out.
Tanner pawned a guitar the night he died.
Deposit for a new apartment.
Explains the cash in his wallet.
TORRES:
Also explains how he found Nelson.
Got security footage from the parking garage.
Can you fast forward to 9:47 p.m., please?
Yep.
And there's our stoner.
And Gunnery Sergeant Tanner walked right by him.
Yeah, he bumped into him in the parking lot.
Purely by chance.
GIBBS:
He recognized him.
ABBY:
Probably from the same photo you did, Gibbs.
Also, Tanner's been studying those poacher files for at least three months.
ABBY:
He must have followed Nelson all the way to the park.
Where is he now?
No permanent address.
He does live in a mobile tiny house.
What about his accomplice?
The guy who shot Officer Cole and the horse does not show up on the video.
But I might have a lead, and straight from the horse's mouth.
Someone had to say it.
MCGEE:
So how much jewelry did you have to go through before you found a match?
A lot.
Ivory's still way too popular.
Uh, the piece from Jody's mouth was from a spiral taper earring.
Thought horses were vegetarians.
Well, they are, but this one was smart enough to take a bite out of the shooter.
REEVES:
Yeah.
His bloody ear wasn't from his knife act.
Oh, he's on the move.
Look.
GIBBS:
Heads up, gang.
We got a truck.
(horn honks)
McGee, you three have the street.
It's a busy place.
Not ideal for a takedown.
Wait on my signal.
Hurry up.
Come on, I called you two hours ago.
Between the park yesterday and the market today, police are too close.
Then forget your stuff so we can get the hell out of here.
If we can get out of the country, my uncle will hide us in Monrovia.
I don't need your uncle.
Let's go.
GIBBS:
Bishop, Torres, move.
Federal agents!
The police, they're here!
Then you better get out of the way.
McGEE:
Gun!
NCIS!
(coughing)
It's over!
Put your hands in the air!
(coughing)
Don't shoot!
(handcuffs clicking)
This is exactly how they train rangers to take down poachers.
NEWSCASTER:
Two arrests have been made in connection with the smuggling of illegal bushmeat into the United States.
Meat tainted with the Ebola virus...
Congratulations, Director.
Two smugglers gave up their airport contacts pretty fast.
Be assured, my government is following up in Liberia.
This will not end here.
Ball's in your court now.
That idiom I know.
(laughs)
Press conference is in an hour.
Director.
Please be mindful in your media portrayal of my government.
It is a powerful tool that could help build trust.
This press conference will be seen back home.
Which is why you're giving the opening statement.
I beg your pardon?
I can't think of anything more powerful than your country seeing a proud and committed public servant.
(laughs)
Thank you.
Now, that's just, um...
that's just beautiful.
Park police said he was born this morning and that they named him after fallen officer Cole.
Mm.
Cole the foal.
(chuckles) Just...
Who's crying over a horse now?
Oh, come on.
It's pepper spray, come on.
Nick, that was three hours ago.
(laughs)
McGEE:
Nick.
Got great news.
What's up, Tim?
Um...
You know what, never mind.
Come on, tell me.
What's up?
Okay, um...
(chuckles)
It's a, it's kind of a funny story, really.
The, uh, the OCAT training.
I just came from HR.
Turns out they, uh, they mixed up the dates.
We're not due until next year.
We didn't have to get sprayed?
Oops.
"Oops"?
Okay, Reeves, hand it over.
I'm sorry, Tim, but I am an independent party.
What?
What are you doing?
No.
Oh, come on.
That's funny.
Very funny, very funny.
Any last words before we take this outside?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on.
This-this is not my fault.
(rooster crowing)
DAWSON:
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
Good to have you back, pal.
What changed, huh?
Gibbs, you've been here all night?
What did you do?
What?
He's eating.
Tell me what you did.
I could get you a coffee or an aspirin.
That's a mighty hard floor.
No.
We don't mind.
Do we, Jody?
(chuckles)
He just needed a buddy.
Well, you know, Jody could also use a ride, if you're up for it.
What do you think?
(laughs) Okay.

WEDGE: (OVER COMLINK) Don't worry, Phoenix Leader.
We'll be back with those codes before you know it.
Let's hope your copilots aren't more of a challenge than the mission.
WEDGE:
What makes you say that?
No reason.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Let's cut the chatter.
We've got a job to do.
Copy that, Phoenix Leader.
Despite what you two think, I'm confident we have our best team on the job.
Okay, since when does our best team include AP-5, Chopper, and Wedge?
I don't get it, AP-5.
Why are you so surprised Hera picked me for this mission?
Your grasp of protocol is sorely lacking.
Imperial pilots never remove their helmets in flight.
I know, I was top of my class at the Imperial Academy.
Oh, Lieutenant Antilles, you are mistaking my attention to detail for an attack on your obviously fragile ego.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
I want this mission to go precisely as planned.
We need to acquire the Imperial codes for our attack on Lothal.
Yeah, I was at the briefing too.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
You just got your circuits overheated that I was put in charge.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Well, it is not your mission.
It is mine.
Captain Syndulla was specific about this being my operation due to my skill set and experience.
Can you two argue somewhere else?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
I will have you know, anything you can do, I can do better.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Yes, I can.
- (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
- Yes, I can!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
That includes even being a rebel spy.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
My programming is superior to yours.
- (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
- Yes, it is.
- (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
- Yes, it is!
- (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
- Yes, it is.
Now I know why I got this mission.
Nobody else wanted it.
- Yes, I can.
- Lock it down, you two.
Here comes the welcoming committee.
IMPERIAL GUARD: (OVER COMLINK) This is a restricted sector.
Identify yourselves.
This is 836-VS.
Delivery of service droids.
Code clearance, uh, B6279.
That was not very convincing.
I definitely would not believe you.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
IMPERIAL GUARD:
836-VS, you've been cleared.
Follow us in.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
No, you follow my lead.
Halt.
Proceed through the scanner one at a time.
I'm aware of the protocol.
(MACHINE BEEPS)
Now you.
I told you to follow my lead.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
No.
That's not what you're doing.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Controller, an unauthorized droid has just entered the ISB base on Killun-71.
This could be the spy droid we have been searching for.
Set a course.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Stop that!
You were fortunate to pass through security.
We still have to get to the central computer.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Yes, these terminals connect to central, but the most current codes will not be accessible here.
This information is precisely why I was made leader of this operation.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
You know that I do more than make calculations.
The only thing you do is make others miserable.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
All right, that is it.
I will retrieve the codes myself.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
IMPERIAL TECHNICIAN 2: 3-9, where is the beta scan update?
Tracking 7-1-6-1.
(BEEPING)
Data received.
The astromech that triggered the alarm on Killun station arrived aboard this shuttle.
Checking archive data on identified rebel droids.
Hmm, quite a unique model.
Out of date.
I believe this C1 astromech is the droid infiltrator
Grand Admiral Thrawn referenced in his memo about the rebels of Phoenix Squadron.
I will alert the station at once.
No, we'll inform the ISB after I have what I need from that spy.
Yes, the simplicity of the structure.
How I do miss Imperial hallways.
So well organized.
Ah, there it is.
The Central Computer Core.
Halt.
What are you doing here?
I am PZ-7.
I was not aware two inventory units
- were assigned to this level.
- Uh, well, it is unfortunate, but I must report, you have been reassigned to the cargo platform.
I am your replacement.
I understand.
I can't believe I'm the same model as that Imperial drone.
The Empire never did take droids seriously.
That alone explains all of Chopper's success.
I, on the other hand, use my superior intellect to my advantage.
Downloading clearance codes for Lothal.
Download complete.
Hmm, I could have done this mission by myself.
Controller, the rebel droid is attempting to access the network.
Perfect.
This means I can now extract the location of the rebel base from its memory.
Capture it.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
Admiral Thrawn will be so pleased.
Sir, there are no base coordinates stored on this droid.
If it cannot divulge the location of their rebel base, then I will use it to lead us there.
Initiating takeover.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
(CHOPPER GRUNTING ERRATICALLY)
This droid's resistance to reprogramming is admirable, but ultimately futile.
(POWERING DOWN)
IMPERIAL TECHNICIAN 1:
Controller, takeover complete.
Well, well, what do we have here?
Just as I suspected.
All talk, no action.
And while you were wasting your time here,
I stole the codes.
Oh, so now you're ignoring me?
Now that I have clearly proven why I am leader,
I suggest you admit failure and return with me to the shuttle.
Fine.
Have it your way.
Controller, I've verified it.
That inventory droid has accessed
Lothal orbital clearance codes from the main computer.
There is a danger.
I calculate a 31% risk of the rebels successfully using the codes, but we have an 82% chance of learning the location of their base if we let them escape and track them.
The odds are with us.
I have successfully retrieved the codes.
We must leave at once.
Wait, where's Chopper?
Well, it is about time.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Did he just apologize?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Yes.
And now he's admitting that I am the better leader?
All right, then, this should be a painless flight back to base.
What exactly are you up to?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Code 16?
That means you're in standby mode.
Since when have you ever been in standby mode?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
My problem?
You said you were code 16.
That is an Imperial term.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Speaking my language?
I only speak Imperial code when required to.
Are you questioning my loyalty again?
WEDGE:
Hey, guys, get up here.
AP-5:
I am onto you.
And it sounds like everything went as planned.
- Good job.
- Thanks, Captain Syndulla, but your two droids did all the work.
Technically, one droid did all the work.
That would be me, AP-5.
Okay, then, well done, all of you.
So, Wedge, how long until you reach our rendezvous point?
We'll be there within the hour.
See you soon.
What is the matter with you?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Thanks for the drink, Chop.
Where was this attitude earlier?
That is an excellent question, Lieutenant.
This new attitude of his feels insincere to me.
Hey, it's better than before.
Now, if you could upgrade your attitude...
My attitude?
I am not the problem here.
In fact, I am the reason my mission was successful.
This inventory droid is a complication that could ruin my plan.
We must appease him.
For now.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
You just called me "Sir"?
Oh, now I see what you're up to, C1-10P!
You want me to relax so you can take possession of the data disk.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Hey, Chop, would you mind checking on the hyperdrive power coils?
Feels like we're dragging a bit.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Look, AP, this childish competition between you and Chopper has gone too far.
It's got to stop.
This has become much more than a game, Lieutenant.
I suspect Chopper may have Compromised on Killun station.
You are paranoid.
Get your sensors checked.
There's nothing wrong with our little friend.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Thanks, buddy.
Do me a favor.
Take the controls while I use the refresher.
(UNZIPS)
Very clever. (FASTENS ZIPPER)
AP-5!
- Now we can talk privately, Lieutenant.
- Now, hold on.
Wait a minute.
We don't have much time, so here's what I know.
I saw Chopper plugged into a network terminal.
When I found him, he was strangely silent, but I thought he was merely ignoring me, as usual.
Then I heard him use an Imperial term.
Okay, stop.
I don't have time for conspiracy theories right now.
I really have to use the refresher.
WEDGE:
Just get out!
But I wasn't... finished.
WEDGE:
Neither was I!
It appears everything is back on track.
The inventory droid has undermined his own credibility.
It is only a matter of time before the astromech leads us to Phoenix Squadron and then their rebel base.
(GROWLING)
Here are the codes, Captain.
I saved them from C1-10P.
AP-5 and Chop were playing some spy game the whole trip.
(BOTH LAUGH)
It was not a game!
This is a serious matter.
- I have grave concerns about Chopper...
- By the way, where is he?
Please, you must listen to me.
Chop, where are you?
Chopper?
I'll find him.
Chopper?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
What are you doing in the hyperspace logs?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Updating your database?
You're not making any sense, Chop.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
You had files wiped on Killun?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
No, if you remember, I always wipe your data after every jump, as a security precaution.
I think you need a power recharge.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
So I turn around, and this one's followed me into the refresher!
(ALL LAUGH)
He did the same thing to me.
I'd hate to spoil the party, but I think there's something wrong with Chop.
As I have pointed out repeatedly.
Now that you mention it, Hera,
Chop's been curiously nice to me.
Whoa, that's not curious.
That's creepy.
Yes, precisely.
Maybe he has a short circuit.
We should run a diagnostic.
(SHIP THUDDING) (HERA EXCLAIMS)
The ship just dropped out of hyperspace.
Chopper, where are you?
Why did the ship drop out of hyperspace?
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
He's in the engine room.
Says there's some kind of malfunction.
- I'll show him a malfunction.
- Go easy on him, Zeb.
We don't know what's wrong with him yet.
Is it wise for all of us to go?
What?
You afraid of Chopper now?
What?
No.
No.
(DOOR SHUTS)
It's locked.
Open this door at once, you traitorous grease bucket!
Chopper, what are you doing?
(AIRLOCK RELEASING)
Well, I hate to say I told you so.
Next time, AP, we'll listen to you, I promise.
Let us hope there is a next time.
Controller, the stolen data has been recovered.
Very good.
Now, install the data spike into their navicomputer.
The spike has begun decoding the coordinates on their navicomputer.
All we need now is a little time, and no interference.
(ZEB GRUNTING)
(ZEB GROANS)
I don't think it's gonna open.
We're stuck in here!
We have no need of prisoners.
Open the cargo bay doors.
(AIRLOCK RELEASING)
No, we're not.

(ZEB GRUNTING)
(ALL GRUNT)
(GROANS)
Ah, a clever solution.
But alas, temporary.
- HERA:
I was afraid of this.
- What now?
Someone has compromised Chopper, and they're trying to download the location of our base.
If we don't get out of here, it's bye-bye Phoenix Squadron.
Hera, there must be another way out.
There is.
Maybe we can override the hatch controls.
There's an access port on the hull.
Outside.
Um, yeah, we don't have spacesuits.
AP-5 doesn't need one.
Well, it is true that my chassis could sustain itself far longer than any life form.
- Not that I'm volunteering.
- Yes, you are.
We don't have much time.
Here's what you'll do...
The time has come to end that traitorous inventory droid.
There's the override circuit.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Oh, dear.
Come on, AP-5!
Hurry!
Data transfer at 50%.
Success!
Search the archive memory for the location of their base.
Aha!
(AP-5 SCREAMS)
AP did it!
Yeah!
Let's go.
Hurry.
(ENGINES BLASTING)
(AP-5 SCREAMS)
(YELLING) No!
(ZAPPING)
Oh, no, you don't!
(POWERING DOWN)
Ha!
Been wanting to do that for a long time.
What is happening?
What is going on?
Data transfer incomplete.
Looks like they nearly got what they wanted.
Yeah?
Well maybe we should give it to them.
They want to mess with my droid, they're gonna pay for it!
Zeb, get him up.
Uh-oh.
Hera's mad.
Whoever's responsible for this had to have a strong signal array to control Chopper at such a distance.
So...
So I'm going to reverse the feed on them and send back a bit more power than they expect.
(BEEPING)
Hey!
You!
Imperial sleemo!
Keep your hands off my droid!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING ERRATICALLY) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
Our circuits are overloading!
The fuel cells have been compromised.
Cut it off.
Cut it off!
Say good-bye to your memory core.
(CIRCUITS BURSTING)
(SCREAMING)
(EXPLODING)
(POWERING DOWN)
Chopper?
Chopper?
You in there?
Come back to me, buddy.
(POWERING UP)
He's back!
Can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad you're okay, Chop.
That was a close one.
Hey, let's not forget AP-5.
After all, he got us out of the hold.
Yeah, AP, way to go...
Wait, where is he?
I should be frightened, but I'm strangely calm.
The silence...
Solitude...
Ah, this is beautiful.
I'm in a world all my own.
I do not feel alone.
♪ It's easy to see ♪
♪ I fit perfectly ♪
♪ In this wonderful ♪
♪ Beautiful simply... ♪
Oh, no, no, no!
No, go away!
I was so happy.
Nice save, AP.
Yeah, AP, we all owe you one.
You tried to scrap me!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
If you are apologizing, I fear you must still be compromised.
Ahh!
Ow!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Oh, sorry for being nice?
I'm done with droids!
From now on, I fly solo!
- Come here, trash can!
- Why, you... (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Like I said, don't mess with my droid.

Hera, there must be another way out.
There is.
Maybe we can override the hatch controls.
There's an access port on the hull.
Outside.
Um, yeah, we don't have spacesuits.
AP-5 doesn't need one.
Well, it is true that my chassis could sustain itself far longer than any life form.
Not that I'm volunteering.
Yes, you are.
We don't have much time.
Here's what you'll do...
The time has come to end that traitorous inventory droid.
There's the override circuit.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING) Oh, dear.
Come on, AP-5!
Hurry!
Data transfer at 50%.
Success!
Search the archive memory for the location of their base.
Aha!
(AP-5 SCREAMS)
AP did it!
Yeah!
Let's go.
Hurry.
(ENGINES BLASTING)
(AP-5 SCREAMS)
(YELLING) No!
(ZAPPING) Oh, no, you don't!
(POWERING DOWN)
Ha!
Been wanting to do that for a long time.
What is happening?
What is going on?
Data transfer incomplete.
Looks like they nearly got what they wanted.
Yeah?
Well maybe we should give it to them.
They want to mess with my droid, they're gonna pay for it!
Zeb, get him up.
Uh-oh.
Hera's mad.
Whoever's responsible for this had to have a strong signal array to control Chopper at such a distance.
So...
So I'm going to reverse the feed on them and send back a bit more power than they expect.
(BEEPING)
Hey!
You!
Imperialsleemo!
Keep your hands off my droid!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING ERRATICALLY) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
Our circuits are overloading!
The fuel cells have been compromised.
Cut it off.
Cut it off!
Saygood-bye toyourmemorycore.
(CIRCUITS BURSTING)
(SCREAMING)
(EXPLODING)
(POWERING DOWN)
Chopper?
Chopper?
You in there?
Come back to me, buddy.
(POWERING UP)
He's back!
Can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad you're okay, Chop.
That was a close one.
Hey, let's not forget AP-5.
After all, he got us out of the hold.
Yeah, AP, way to go...
Wait, where is he?
I should be frightened, but I'm strangely calm.
The silence...
Solitude...
Ah, this is beautiful.
I'm in a world all my own.
I do not feel alone.

Oh, no, no, no!
No, go away!
I was so happy.
Nice save, AP.
Yeah, AP, we all owe you one.
You tried to scrap me!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
If you are apologizing, I fear you must still be compromised.
Ahh!
Ow!
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Oh, sorry for being nice?
I'm done with droids!
From now on, I fly solo!
Come here, trash can!
Why, you... (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Like I said, don't mess with my droid.
(AIRLOCK RELEASING)
WEDGE: (OVER COMLINK) Don't worry, Phoenix Leader.
We'll be back with those codes before you know it.
Let's hope your copilots aren't more of a challenge than the mission.
WEDGE:
What makes you say that?
No reason. (BOTH CHUCKLE)
Let's cut the chatter.
We've got a job to do.
